Says photo shows "one of Tesla's lithium supply mines where entire mountains are eliminated."
and a new one from a march post follows that pattern with a photo it says shows one of tesla lithium supply mines where entire mountains are eliminated
photo does not show lithium mine it s a copper mine
seeking to simplify the complicated issue of clean energy social media posts have proliferated claiming to show pictures of the destruction left by lithium mining for hybrid and batteries
the post includes two images of an oil well and a mine
the caption says the oil well is where organic material is pumped out of the ground taking up around to square feet contrasting that with the mine which it says came at a cost of entire mountains thousands of square miles of land and billions of gallons of oil and fuel
