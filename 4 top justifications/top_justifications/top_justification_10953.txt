james clyburn says original confederate flag compromise was to move it out of public view
clyburn said that there was a compromise measure to place the confederate flag in a more discreet location on the south carolina state house grounds
what happened was when some people rejected the compromise the legislature out of defiance put that flag where it is today in front of the statehouse
