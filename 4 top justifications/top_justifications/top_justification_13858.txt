Louisiana is turning down $100 million "that would require us to change our unemployment law, that would have actually raised taxes on Louisiana businesses."
the million we turned down was temporary federal dollars that would require us to change our unemployment laws that would actually raised taxes on louisiana businesses
he is right that the million he turned down would have required louisiana to change its unemployment law
why would you turn down million for federal unemployment assistance for your state asked moderator david gregory
