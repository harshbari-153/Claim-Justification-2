"Biden’s plan will immediately let in 25,000 asylum-seekers who’d been waiting in Mexico as their cases were judged."
johnson said biden s plan will immediately let in who d been waiting in mexico as their cases were judged
ron johnson biden s plan will immediately let in who d been waiting in mexico as their cases were judged
while the biden plan changes the trump approach and returns to a system that allows asylum seekers into the country while their cases are being considered johnson s tweet leaves the impression there would be a wave of people admitted instantly
so after more than a week of the program it s clear the influx of asylum seekers has not been immediate as johnson claimed it would be
while they wait for their asylum claims to be adjudicated even though we know a vast majority of them do not have valid asylum claims and will likely stay even when their claims are denied
