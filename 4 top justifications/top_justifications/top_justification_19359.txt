Every single candidate President Obama campaigned for lost in the midterms.
a facebook post claims that every candidate obama hit the campaign trail for lost in tuesday s election
post has been shared more than times and claims that every single candidate the former president campaigned for lost their races in the election
obama did rally for democratic candidates who ended up losing but the same goes for several others he supported who won their races
however nowhere in that story does it say that all the candidates obama stumped for lost
while we found that several candidates obama supported on the campaign trail did indeed lose it certainly wasn t all of them
