Cranston's 2014-2015 "budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefit costs."
cranston mayor allan fung said our budget funds percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefit costs
however the old police and fire pension programs administered by the city are a different story because over the years cranston elected officials neglected to put enough money into those programs to cover future retiree costs
does mayor allan fung budget for cranston cover all retirement costs
cranston actually has several pension plans
so it caught our attention when fung who is running for governor as a republican sent out a letter with the city new tax bills reporting that our budget funds percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefits costs
