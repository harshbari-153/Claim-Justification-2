Says Adam Sandler said "Mormons are some of the most decent people Iâ€™ve ever come across."
i mean i know you re just having some fun here but from my experience mormons are some of the most decent people i ve ever come across the story attributed to sandler
ran under the headline what adam sandler is saying about mormons
a laundry list of fake news sites have posted a story claiming adam sandler praised mormons in a podcast but there s no evidence the actor ever made the statements
i don t think i ve ever had a reason to say anything negative about mormons
the post said sandler was on an unnamed podcast when the atheist host began to disparage religion in general and mormons in particular
