"McCain has voted repeatedly at least six times against funding for global HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB fund, once as one of only 14 senators."
in a news release dated march the dnc claimed to mccain malaria pledge by contrasting mccain rhetoric with the reality that mccain has voted repeatedly at least six times against funding for global malaria and tb fund once as one of only senators
the release proceeds to list six instances between and in which mccain voted against bills or amendments that would have boosted funding for malaria prevention
in both of the votes cited mccain voted against an emergency supplemental spending bill to combat terrorism on the grounds that it included too many provisions malaria funding included that had nothing to do with terrorism
indeed mccain did vote against the bills cited by the dnc
in the second of those votes mccain was one of only senators to oppose a less generous gop alternative
