"22 times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of" anti-deportation "measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, ‘I just changed the law.’"
like mccaul abbott overstates the number of confirmed instances of obama indicating he couldn t independently do more to prevent deportations
in the end still we confirmed nearly instances from into of obama saying he couldn t do more to spare immigrants from deportation absent congressional action
did obama say he personally changed the law
obama went on point number two the way the change in the law works is that we reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration laws generally
in november obama declared the administration s plans to forswear the deportation of unauthorized residents meeting certain conditions telling the american people if you ve been in america for more than five years if you have children who are american citizens or legal residents if you register pass a criminal background check and you re willing to pay your fair share of taxes you ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation
