The Keystone XL pipeline "doesnâ€™t even have any oil for America."
gillibrand said the keystone xl pipeline doesn t even have any oil for america
it doesn t even have any oil for america to make our gas prices cheaper
will all the oil from the keystone xl pipeline be exported
there s nothing on the oil coming through a pipeline from canada that requires all of that to be sold somewhere else
the keystone xl pipeline was designed to transport oil to the gulf coast because refineries in the region are already equipped to process heavier crude oils like those found in canada s alberta province
