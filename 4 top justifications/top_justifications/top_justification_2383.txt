The military arrested "bedridden Gavin Newsom."
no the military didn t arrest gov gavin newsom
but an article from the website real raw news wove a completely different narrative to explain his brief absence from the public eye that a bedridden newsom was taken from his home and arrested by the military
this one about newsom s arrest is another one of those false stories
the media site claimed that an unknown number of marines sent by united states marine forces special command killed two california state police officers guarding newsom s residence narrowly missed catching newsom s wife and children as they escaped into a fortified safe room and took newsom unconscious and on life support and his doctor away into custody
claiming that newsom woke up in the guantanamo bay detention camp and will be tried when he recovers for the deaths of thousands of senior citizens and california children who had developed lethal staph infections from prolonged mask usage
