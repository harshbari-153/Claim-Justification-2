"I've either balanced every budget or we turned back a surplus."
in a july interview on upfront with mike gousha which airs on clarke declared i ve either balanced every budget or we ve turned back a surplus
appearance with host charlie sykes on clarke rephrased his claim a bit i have a record where i ve balanced every budget or some of those years i ve turned back budget surpluses
clarke said he s balanced the budget or returned a surplus to milwaukee county for every year since he became sheriff in
these are the budget surpluses and deficits the office has encountered under clarke
a difference between budgeted and actual revenues contributed to the deficit for that year
