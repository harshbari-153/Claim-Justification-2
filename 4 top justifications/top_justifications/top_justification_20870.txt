"Chinese lunar rover finds no evidence of American moon landings."
the claims came after the chinese moon rover allegedly couldn t find any proof of american landings on the moon
the rover took thousands of photos and after analyzing them the chinese discovered that there s no trace of these moon landings
it also points to thousands of photos taken by the chinese yutu moon rover which launched in december and ceased to operate in july stating these showed no trace of the apollo moon landing
an internet post claiming that chinese officials had called the american moon landing a complete hoax is a fake news story that has been in circulation for years
the lunar reconnaissance spacecraft has captured ample evidence of the apollo landing though which can be seen in this database
