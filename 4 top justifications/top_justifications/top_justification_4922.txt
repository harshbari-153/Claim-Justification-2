"An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates."
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates he tweeted
trump tweeted an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates
the post s headline is note to sanders supporters bernie would have won if not for super delegate system it makes a flawed argument that sanders would have nabbed the nomination if all of the clinton superdelegates backed him instead
sanders would have still lost without superdelegates in the mix because clinton won a majority of the popular vote and pledged delegates
no donald trump bernie sanders would have won even if super delegates were nixed
