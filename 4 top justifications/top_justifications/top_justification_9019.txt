Under Rahm Emanuel, "Weâ€™ve got tree trimmers making six figures."
green claimed that under emanuel s leadership we ve got tree trimmers making six figures
we ve got tree trimmers making six figures
green s claim about tree trimmers was wrapped in a broader critique of emanuel s fiscal leadership
both the source his campaign provided and the city data on which it was based indicate that a handful of tree trimmers employed by the city s streets and sanitation department did make six figures after accounting for overtime pay in the last year for which all relevant data was available
progressive messaging aside however green s claim got us wondering does the city really pay some tree trimmers six figures
