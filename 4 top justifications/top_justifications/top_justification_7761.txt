Detroit has "2,503 dead people registered" including "one voter born in 1823."
a facebook post stated detroit has dead people registered including one voter born in
it was followed by four bullet points made the following points detroit had duplicate voter registrations more registered voters than eligible voters dead people registered and one voter born in
dead voters on detroit s voter rolls including person born in that post is outdated
the lawsuit compared the state s voter file with death records and found more than dead people including one born in years before michigan joined the union
the fact that dead people remain on voter rolls in michigan or any other state does not itself equal fraud it s only a crime if someone then fills out a ballot in the name of a dead voter and sends it in
