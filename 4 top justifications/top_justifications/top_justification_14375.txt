"The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression."
one of the statistics reich offered was this the ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the great depression
robert reich says ratio of corporate profits to wages is highest since before great depression
we didn t find data so the one part of reich s statement that we can t prove is that the ratio was higher just before the great depression
the ratio can rise for either of two reasons because corporate profits rise or because wages stagnate
this pushes the ratio of profits to wages higher
