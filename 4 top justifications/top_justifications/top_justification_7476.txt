Because George Holding doesn’t live in the congressional district he’s running for, he "doesn’t experience the same things that we are all experiencing."
george holding in a recent debate
but does that mean he doesn t experience the same things that we are all experiencing the line implies he s not familiar with the people who would be his constituents
while he doesn t live in the district holding does represent most of the people who will be in the new district
ellmers is right that holding doesn t live in the district he wants to represent
ellmers said holding doesn t live in the district and thus doesn t understand the experiences of its constituents
