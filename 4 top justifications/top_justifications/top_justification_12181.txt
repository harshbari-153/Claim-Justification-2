Says "99 percent of the time police officers aren't charged when they kill young people of color."
crump said percent of the time police officers aren t charged when they kill a young person of color
percent of the time police officers are charged when they kill young people of color
so when crump said percent of the time police are not charged in the killing of a person of color he might have been in the ballpark
the question of how often law enforcement officers are charged in the death of a young person of color is distinct from the debate over whether police are more likely to kill minorities than whites
to flip his approach he would be saying police are charged percent of the time while the flawed numbers we have say percent regardless of race might be closer to the truth
