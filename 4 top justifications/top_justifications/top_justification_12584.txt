Obamacare "prevents (Florida) from regulating insurance."
the republican party of florida said obamacare prevents florida from regulating insurance
obamacare wo let florida regulate health insurance state gop says
so who s right does obamacare keep florida s insurance regulator from regulating insurance we re not going to make you fill out dozens of forms in triplicate to find out because we ve got you covered
since other states have started or are planning to enact stronger insurance regulations to enforce obamacare rules
ironically the republican party of florida told us it was referring directly to the portion of the affordable care act that says state law is to be followed unless it contradicts the federal health care law and that s why obamacare makes the insurance commissioner obsolete when it comes to setting rates
