Cities like Seattle have decided to ban food carts.
portland city commissioner randy leonard says seattle bans food carts
so in seattle fixed food pods aren t allowed and only certain food items can be sold from sidewalk food carts
some cities such as seattle have just taken the option of banning them they don t allow them he said at a recent city council meeting
but neither of those factors translate into a city ban on food carts as leonard said
now what about seattle washington state law limits what s sold from sidewalk food carts to hot dogs popcorn snow cones coffee chestnuts maybe buttered corn cobs but there s no such restrictions on food trucks parked in private lots
