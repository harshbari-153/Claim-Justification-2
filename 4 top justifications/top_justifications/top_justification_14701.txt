if people work and make more money they lose more in benefits than they would earn in salary rubio wrote in the book released jan
the vast majority of people face some higher taxes and lost benefits when they make more money but they would still take home more in pay than they would under a lower salary
there is evidence that when a large chunk of the amount of every additional dollar earned goes to taxes or to offset a decrease in benefits people work less
is it possible that the benefits lost could be so great that a person would lose more in benefits than they would gain by an increase in wages
