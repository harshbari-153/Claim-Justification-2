"We cut our deficits by more than half."
but there was the president at laborfest in milwaukee proclaiming we cut our deficits by more than half
at a union rally on labor day obama declared we cut our deficits by more than half
but no matter which figure is used the deficit as a share of the economy still fell by more than half
indeed deficits are often expressed that way as well
at that point the budget gap topped a trillion bucks and republican congressmen called out obama because the deficit had been reduced by just percent
