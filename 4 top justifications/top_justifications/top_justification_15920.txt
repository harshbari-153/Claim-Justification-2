every day a resume is percent less likely to get responded to than a resume ross said
the name on each resume was randomly assigned so the same resume in some cases had a black name and in others had a white name
after responding to ads with more than resumes the researchers found that the job applicants with white names needed to send resumes to get one callback but the black candidate needed to send for one
they noted that having a black name on its own is not likely to have a big effect throughout the interviewing process as an employer who meets an applicant and discriminates on race would immediately notice his or her race during the meeting
