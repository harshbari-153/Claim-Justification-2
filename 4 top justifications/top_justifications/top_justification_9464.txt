Under a proposed Georgia law, "women who miscarry could become felons."
however women who miscarry might not be handled as felons
franklin s bill hb women who miscarry could become felons if they can not prove that there was no human involvement whatsoever in the causation of their miscarriage she wrote
women who miscarry could be charged as felons is that true franklin has sponsored similar bills without success
since hb does not repeal existing georgia feticide law it s possible to argue its passage might not lead to the prosecution of women in the death of their fetuses
but there s an exception under georgia s feticide by vehicle statute
