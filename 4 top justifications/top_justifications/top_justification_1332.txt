"Statistics show 2 to 3 Texas women per week have major complications and 10 women per week seek help at an ER after an abortion."
statistics show to texas women per week have major complications and women per week seek help at an er after an abortion the release said
texas attorney general ken paxton s office said in a press release that statistics show to texas women per week have major complications and women per week seek help at an er after an abortion
we wanted to check is it true that two to three texas women have major complications from abortion per week and that women in that time seek help at an emergency room after an abortion
the attorney general s office then multiplied those statistics by an estimated abortions per year in texas a number taken from department of state health services data
that study included a higher percentage of abortions performed in the second and third trimesters than occurred in texas making a direct extrapolation to attribute those numbers to women in the lone star state problematic
