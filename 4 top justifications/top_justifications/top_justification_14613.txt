in the ad obama said he will protect your guaranteed benefits in medicare while mitt romney would take away medicare as guaranteed benefits
but are there guaranteed benefits for medicare today and if so would they be at risk if romney wins a lot of it depends on how you define these words

less clear is whether the operational changes romney would make would undermine the guarantee of benefits under medicare
a new ad from president barack obama emphasizes a favorite democratic talking point that medicare currently has guaranteed benefits that could be taken away if mitt romney wins the presidency
