I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven't won one against a white person.
during that interview while discussing his grammy wins west said i don t know if this is statistically right but i m assuming i have the most grammys of anyone my age but i haven t won one against a white person
at age and with grammy wins out of nominations west has the most awards for anyone his age slate said
but on the facts west claimed he has won the most grammys for anyone his age
he has never won overall grammys in categories such as album of the year and record of the year
but all of west s grammy wins have been in the rap and r b categories which are dominated by black artists
