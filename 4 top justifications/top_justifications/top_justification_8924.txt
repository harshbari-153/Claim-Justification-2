Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed held not one conversation with the public about the new Falcons stadium project
so does perry score a touchdown or at least a field goal with his claim that mayor reed did not hold one conversation with the public leading up to the new falcons stadium deal
atlanta mayor kasim reed was quoted in the atlanta as saying atlanta would have a big public conversation
with the new stadium project no one or no group asked reed s office to hold a town hall meeting jacobs said
and reed did not host any town hall meetings in the communities that will be impacted most by the stadium
but his attendance there nor at any other council meeting doesn t qualify as the mayor holding a public conversation on the issue perry told politifact georgia
