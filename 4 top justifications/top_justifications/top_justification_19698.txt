lenny curry says charlie crist and todd akin hold same abortion position no exception except life of the mother
in this case curry said todd akin charliecristfl hold same abortion views
he later tweeted answer todd akin charliecristfl hold same abortion views
we ve many claims about crist and abortion and several about akin and abortion
but here we wanted to check to see if curry was correct to claim that akin and crist hold identical positions on abortion that they are opposed except when the life of the mother is in jeopardy
