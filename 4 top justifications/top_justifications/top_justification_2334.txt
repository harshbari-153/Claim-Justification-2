"Bill Clinton's peace dividend . . . cut the military 25 and 30 percent."
i think we should increase the size of our military substantially to overcome the damage that bill clinton did with the peace dividend he said adding that a lot of the cause of the smaller military force was bill clinton peace dividend in which he cut the military and percent
the two republicans are correct that military forces were reduced significantly under clinton
but they are selectively choosing numbers that make it appear that the military cuts were clinton alone
the republicans are trying to portray clinton and the democrats as weak on defense and to make the peace dividend look like a partisan effort
the peace dividend began with a bush
