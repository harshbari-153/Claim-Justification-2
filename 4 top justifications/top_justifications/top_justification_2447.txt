Nancy Pelosi explains how Democrats demonize political opponents through the "wrap-up smear."
social media users are claiming that house speaker nancy pelosi admitted she used smear tactics to demonize political opponents
a longer version of the video shows that pelosi was accusing republicans of using the smear against democrats running for office in the midterms
more recent posts have claimed that the clip shows pelosi describing the tactics democrats used to attack former president donald trump
conservative activist groups pundits and conspiracy outlets all asserted that it showed pelosi describing the smear tactics that democrats had used on kavanaugh
here s why you shouldn t believe these claims the video takes pelosi out of context and misleadingly captions her remarks making it seem like she s explaining a political tactic called the smear that she and other democrats have deployed in the past
