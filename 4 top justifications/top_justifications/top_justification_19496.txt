In 2010, Betty Sutton "voted to destroy Medicare."
consider what the nrcc said on july in an apparent attempt to gain senior votes congresswoman betty sutton voted to destroy medicare
nrcc targets betty sutton support for health care reform in claim she voted to destroy medicare
does that mean that she voted to destroy medicare as the nrcc said in its news release july we asked nrcc spokeswoman katie prill about the claim since prill sent the email to reporters
now consider that sutton a democratic congresswoman from copley township voted for the affordable care act
but destroying medicare is strong medicine and it goes far beyond the inconvenience of changing coverage
