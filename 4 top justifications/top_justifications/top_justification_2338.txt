A national poll found that among people who oppose the Democratic health care reform bill, "almost 40 percent" opposed it not because it goes too far, but because "they donâ€™t think it goes far enough. ... They will not be unhappy when we pass health care reform."
given the intense media focus on how well the democratic plan polls franklin said the irony is that progressives have made health care reform less likely to pass by telling pollsters they oppose this bill
it does not conclusively demonstrate that as yarmuth put it nearly percent of voters will not be unhappy when we pass health care reform
they asked of all the people who are opposed to health care or say they are how many are opposed to it because they don t think it goes far enough
