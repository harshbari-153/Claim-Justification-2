"In May we generated more jobs than all the rest of the country combined: 28,000 jobs in May for the state, 54,000 for the entire country."
on june as news media gathered at the state capitol for his signing of a tort reform bill he repeated it in may we generated more jobs than all the rest of the country combined jobs in may for the state for the entire country
