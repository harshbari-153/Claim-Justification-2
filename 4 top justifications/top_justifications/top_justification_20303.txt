Says longstanding Food and Drug Administration regulations "created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly" for the coronavirus.
crenshaw said in a tweet that longstanding fda regulations created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly for the coronavirus
did fda regulations slow testing for the coronavirus
we have stringent fda regulations long in place that created barriers to the private industry creating a test quickly
fda procedures adopted in meant laboratories had to seek the agency s approval before developing and using tests in communities a policy many health care officials have said prevented the country from taking early action in response to the novel coronavirus
it is important to keep in mind that other factors have contributed to the low levels of testing for the virus beyond the fda regulations
