"There's just one piece of legislation that is now law" with Sen. Ted Cruz'sÂ "name on it."
bash said there s only one piece of legislation that is now law that has ted cruz s name on it
it fair that there just one piece of legislation that is now law with your name on it she asked
of the bills cruz has sponsored only one has been signed into law
cruz s name is on two more laws as a cosponsor
but that bill that was and it is the only bill cruz has passed in his two years in office bash added
