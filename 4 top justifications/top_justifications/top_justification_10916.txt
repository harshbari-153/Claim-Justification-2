gerry connolly and his fellow democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out the nrcc said in a may email and press release
was it really connolly or even all the house democrats who maxed out america s credit card let s take a look
yes the nation s debt has gone up rapidly during the two and a half years gerry connolly has been in office
at the same time percent of the nation s debt has come during connolly s years in congress
so right away it s apparent connolly himself couldn t have maxed out the credit card
