"You can't read a speech by George Washington . . . without hearing him reference God, the Almighty."
so clearly limbaugh was wrong that you ca read a washington speech without seeing a reference to god
washington famous speech at newburgh to officers of the continental army who were threatening to desert for lack of pay also contained no references to god other than as an exclamation
what can this writer have in view by recommending such measures that and one other reference to the god of armies were the only two times in the speeches we read that washington used the word god
so washington was nearly the devout christian that limbaugh suggested he was and he did not refer to god in all his speeches as the talk show host claimed
to see whether you indeed ca read a speech by george washington without seeing a reference to god we checked washington most noteworthy speeches starting with his two inaugural addresses since limbaugh mentioned those specifically
