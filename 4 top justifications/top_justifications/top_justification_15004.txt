"No, I did not (have illegal immigrants working at his mansion)."
fending off an attack by romney that implied he was soft on illegal immigration rudy giuliani asked the former massachusetts governor you did have illegal immigrants working at your mansion did you
later the standard reply from romney campaign did even contest that the landscaping company working on his lawn had hired illegal immigrants
the owner of the company was a legal immigrant who claimed that workers were legal though he did not request documentation
considering romney forceful rhetoric on illegal immigrants this explanation has satisfied his opponents
romney did amend that statement with a vague ramble that homeowners should have to ask for the papers of anyone with a funny accent who is working on their house
