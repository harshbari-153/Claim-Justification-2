The USA Freedom Act undercuts privacy because "the phone records will be in the hands of the phone companies with hundreds of people available to look at the records, versus 20 or 30 people in the government."
graham said that because of the usa freedom act the phone records will be in the hands of the phone companies with hundreds of people available to look at the records versus or people in the government
we took a look into graham s claim that because of the freedom act hundreds of phone company employees will now have access to the phone records as opposed to just a couple dozen government employees currently
the freedom act changes things by keeping these records in the hands of the phone companies
all of the records will be in the hands of the phone company with hundreds of people available to look at the records versus or people in the government
i see very little prospect that the nsa queries of phone records held under the usa freedom act would result in more people having access to phone records than under the nsa bulk collection program edgar said
