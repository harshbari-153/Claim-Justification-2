did sidney poitier say trump might be the goat
a post on the internet quotes actor sidney poitier praising president donald trump but the quotes are made up

during my lifetime america was under different leaderships but i have never seen someone to lead this nation with passion like donald trump
this man might be the greatest of all time we have to give him all the support we have
