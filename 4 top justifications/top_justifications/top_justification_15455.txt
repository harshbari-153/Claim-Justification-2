Says U.S. Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., "opposes a vote on his own legislation that he proposed just a few months ago."
the democratic senatorial campaign committee said daines opposes a vote on legislation he introduced
in fact daines is so thoroughly wedded to his partisan political shutdown that he opposes a vote on his own legislation that he proposed just a few months ago
in this we ll look at whether daines actually opposed a vote on a bill he introduced
independent analysts agree that daines would not have the chance to vote on the measure he introduced
in the view of the democrats daines has failed to do all he could to put his legislation to a vote
