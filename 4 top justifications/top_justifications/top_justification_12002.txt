the state of texas does not even use the system to determine if someone is legally in our country when they apply for a job she said
is texas state government really not using the verification service singled out by hutchison if not does that mean it is checking whether job applicants are legally living here
but no law requires employers to verify the authenticity of their workers documents
that how the state of texas has certified new hires legal residency since when a federal law prohibited employers from knowingly hiring residents who are not legally living in the united states
it has incorrectly identified legal residents as undocumented workers and vice versa
