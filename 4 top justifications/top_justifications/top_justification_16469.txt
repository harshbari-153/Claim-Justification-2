Says Rick Perry flip-flopped on gay marriage by first saying it was a stateâ€™s rights issue and then saying he was in favor of a federal constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.
however after getting strong pushback from the religious right community perry changed his position saying he was in favor of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage everywhere
perry who has been weighing a presidential run said he opposes gay marriage but that he also a firm believer of the amendment
first perry said that he didn t have any problem with states like new york approving gay marriage though he didn t think it was appropriate for texas
perry does mention his concerns about the courts imposing their views of marriage on states gay marriage will soon be the policy of the united states irrespective of federalism the constitution or the wishes of the american people
perry manifesto fed up our fight to save america from washington strongly endorses states rights but does not discuss a federal constitutional amendment on gay marriage
