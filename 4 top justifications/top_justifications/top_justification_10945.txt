Says Charlotte Nash "pretends to be a chicken farmer" in order to get property tax exemptions.
pruitt said nash has an agricultural exemption for that property because it is a farm
gause s real point is whether nash actually deserves the agricultural exemption
nash has an exemption for agricultural purposes for the smaller property where she is registered to vote and an exemption for timber purposes for the larger plot of land the county assessor told us
but that refers to a use of the property nash said
gause said nash is wrongly using a conservation use assessment exemption to get the tax break
