"I investigated Abramoff and people ended up in jail."
i investigated abramoff and people ended up in jail of course we get angry
bob ney was convicted as part of the abramoff investigation
while he serves his sentence abramoff is cooperating with authorities in the ongoing corruption investigation of administration officials lawmakers and their aides
federal prosecutors also were conducting extensive investigations into how abramoff and scanlon laundered millions of dollars through charities and front organizations in an effort take their cut of the proceeds and avoid paying taxes
it certainly can be argued that mccain was the most aggressive member of congress who investigated the abramoff affair and that his efforts expanded inquiries into wrongdoing that ultimately resulted in the convictions of bush administration officials congressional staffers and businesspeople
