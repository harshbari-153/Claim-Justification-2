"I released way more (tax) information than Bruce Rauner has."
setting aside the campaign rhetoric of pritzker s response we were struck by his statement that he had released way more information about his taxes than rauner
i released way more information than bruce rauner has and it s important to recognize that unlike bruce rauner who yeah he paid taxes but you know how he made his money by cutting jobs
pritzker said he released way more information than bruce rauner has on income taxes
no jb pritzker did not release more tax information than bruce rauner
rauner also has regularly issued statements on charitable giving with his returns
