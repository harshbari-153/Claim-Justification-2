Said Dan McCready "got nearly $1 million in support from a Nancy Pelosi aligned dark money org in the 2018 election cycle right after he tweeted, ‘Dark money has no place in our politics’."
turns out wrong dan mccready got nearly million in support from a nancy pelosi aligned dark money org in the election cycle right after he tweeted dark money has no place in our politics
did mccready get support from dark money
in a tight congressional race that is now being redone because of allegations of election fraud democratic candidate dan mccready spoke out on twitter against dark money in politics
it turns out mccready indeed got support from a dark money group
when we contacted his campaign it released a statement from mccready saying he believes that money is corrupting our politics and that we ve got to take on special interests and the status quo which is why if elected to congress i will advocate for the mandatory disclosure of all donors to dark money groups
