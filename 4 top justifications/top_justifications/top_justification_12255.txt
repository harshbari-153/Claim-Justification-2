"Tell me what Madeleine Albright’s position was on the War on Iraq. I wouldn’t be surprised if she supported it."
tell me what madeleine albright s position was on the war in iraq sanders asked
sanders said tell me what madeleine albright s position was on the war in iraq
searching transcript and news interviews in between those two comments we found that albright has said she would support the troops if it came to that but she continuously questioned the bush administration eagerness to invade iraq
to be fair it s not entirely unreasonable for sanders to have assumed albright supported the war given her record as a staunch critic of saddam hussein said tom lippman a journalist and author of madeleine albright and the new american diplomacy
while albright has voiced support for the troops and said she understands the rationale behind the war her comments suggest she would have rather avoided the invasion
