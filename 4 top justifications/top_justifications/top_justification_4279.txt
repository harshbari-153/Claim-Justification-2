Says Measure 3-386 will cost a fortune for elections while Measure 3-388 will cost less.
you guessed our burning question does the measure cost a fortune while smaller elections cost less a similar mailer went out just this week
smaller election less cost
in fact special elections could cost more
we find that the proponents of the smaller election option have not proved their case that their version would cost less or that a countywide election would cost a fortune
she said the measure would cost more because it would require more notice and explanation to more voters who live in disparate parts of the county
