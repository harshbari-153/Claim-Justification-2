marco rubio s proposed overhaul of the nation s colleges and universities saying his plan unfairly benefits schools

pac accuses rubio of favoring colleges in education plan
that makes it extremely difficult for american bridge to say the change is specifically to help colleges despite rubio past affinity for the businesses
