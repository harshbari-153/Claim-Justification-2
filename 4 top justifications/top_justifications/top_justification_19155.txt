Minnesotaâ€™s "advantage" in economic growth has been having "Republicans in charge of at least one part of government" for all but two years, while Wisconsin Democrats "for many years" before 2011 controlled both legislative chambers and the governorship.
walker said minnesota s advantage has been having republicans in charge of at least one part of government for all but two years while wisconsin democrats for many years controlled both legislative chambers and the governorship before
but walker also spoke of minnesota s advantage in terms of economic growth and attributed it to politics
going back further to republicans in wisconsin controlled at least one of the three power spots every year until
in making the comparison though he overstates how long the democrats had total control in wisconsin
so that means republicans controlled at least one key lever for those eight years
