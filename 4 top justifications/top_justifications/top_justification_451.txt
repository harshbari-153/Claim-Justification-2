Herd immunity is probably why California has far fewer COVID-19 deaths than New York.
a widely shared post on facebook claims herd immunity is probably why california has far fewer deaths than new york
so is it possible a naturally occurring herd immunity has in effect inoculated much of california keeping the number of the state s coronavirus deaths a fraction of those in new york
herd immunity curbed covid deaths no
that means new york had more than times as many coronavirus deaths even though its population is only about that of california
do you wonder why ca only has deaths compared to deaths in ny welp researchers at stanford school of medicine suspect it because ca had already developed herd immunity to the virus
