Soft-tissue cancer diagnoses have "climbed through the roof" in 2021 as a result of COVID-19 vaccines.
a facebook post claims that one oncologist said that cancers have climbed through the roof in a increase and that we know why it s happening which implies it s related to the covid vaccines that rolled out early this year
a facebook post implied that an anecdotal spike in cancers is due to the vaccine rollout
there is also no evidence to support the claim from cole that the covid vaccines are responsible for overall increases in cancer or other illnesses
there has been a gradual rise in new diagnoses of cancer over recent years one expert said and any actual rise this year would likely be due to those continued trends
there are more than subtypes of the cancer according to the mayo clinic
