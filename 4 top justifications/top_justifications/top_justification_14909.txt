Says instead of arresting a teen who was sneaking into a gym, a Chicago cop "shot him 53 times."
a facebook post that claims a chicago police officer shot a teenager times for sneaking into a gym is a malicious distortion of what actually happened
a chicago cop didn t shoot a teen for sneaking into a gym he bought him a membership
in reality the police officer helped the teen buy a gym membership
just north of chicago the police would be called
the gym s staff eventually alerted the skokie police department after the boy attempted to get in again
