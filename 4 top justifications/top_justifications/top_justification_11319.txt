Says Obama is only president in history who has deliberately removed the words "endowed by their Creator" when referring to the Declaration of Independence.
obama it says is the only president in history who has deliberately removed the words endowed by their creator when referring to the declaration of independence not once but several times
our ruling s ad says obama is the only president in history who has deliberately removed the words
it s true that obama has omitted endowed by their creator in speeches but he s also included those words many times
but obama not the only president in history who has done it
but is obama unique among presidents in skipping the religious reference indeed we did find video of obama paraphrasing the line and leaving out the creator
