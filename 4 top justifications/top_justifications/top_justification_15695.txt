Says his elections proposal would allow "a potential of 168 hours (of early voting), which I think is the most weâ€™ve ever had."
scott said that his proposal would allow a potential of hours which i think is the most we ve ever had for early voting
he s right that his proposal would give supervisors of elections the option to offer hours of early voting and that would be a record
here we ll examine whether scott is right to say his proposal would be the most hours for early voting
so under scott s proposal supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of hours of early voting days multiplied by hours a day
we would likely conduct early voting as it was structured prior to hb said public services director mary cooney in an email
