Say Maine U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin "voted to gut your retirement benefits."
it accuses bruce poliquin the incumbent republican in maine s expansive congressional district of voting to gut your retirement benefits
the maine democratic party said poliquin voted to gut your retirement benefits
this leads to the second part of the maine democrats claim that poliquin has turned his back on us by supporting a raise in the retirement age and capping cost of living increases for social security
the maine democrats flyer provides footnotes to explain how this could affect social security and medicare and how the tax plan helped poliquin s donors
in maine employees in the public pension system don t pay into social security and generally don t draw its benefits
