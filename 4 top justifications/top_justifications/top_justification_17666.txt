Ethnic Russians face "genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime."
putin said ethnic russians in ukraine face genocide
putin has long said genocide was happening in the donbas region of eastern ukraine
but putin also called russia s air and ground attacks across ukraine a rescue mission to protect people who for eight years now have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the kyiv regime
anatoly antonov defended the use of the term genocide citing ukrainian forces shelling residential neighborhoods and mass burials of almost civilians near luhansk who died just because they thought russian was their native language
through the lens of genocide putin can tap into russian patriotism and argue that this attack is just and noble
