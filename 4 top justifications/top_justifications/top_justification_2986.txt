in fact a study conducted by a team of renowned economists from the massachusetts institute of technology harvard and dartmouth concluded that medicaid s value to its beneficiaries is significantly lower than the actual cost of the program
this conflicts with the resolution s claim that the paper showed that medicaid s value to its beneficiaries is significantly lower than the actual cost of the program
we wondered whether price and his committee were correct to cite the work of three health care academics to support the argument that medicaid is an empty promise that provides significantly lower value to its beneficiaries than its actual cost
academics did conclude that only a fraction of what medicaid spends directly replaces what its beneficiaries would have had to pay for their health care costs
