The health care bills will be "mandated spending. You can't cut it, regardless of the budget circumstances."
he said that the health care legislation is going to be mandated spending
limbaugh was trying to make the point that spending demanded in the health care bill would expand without ordinary budgetary limits and that the health bill spending would ultimately crowd out other government necessities such as funding the military
so while it would be hard to take away mandatory health insurance assistance to americans it not true to say as limbaugh did that you ca cut it regardless of the budget circumstances
so limbaugh is correct in that the most important new types of spending in the health care bills are mandatory
along those lines the senate finance health care bill includes a provision that is supposed to ensure the mandatory spending wo bust the budget
