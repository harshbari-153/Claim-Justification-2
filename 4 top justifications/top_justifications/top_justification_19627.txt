Says "our taxes have doubled" with Rick Perry in office.
updated ron paul says our taxes doubled under rick perry
our taxes have doubled since he been in office
until paul piped up we hadn t heard that taxes doubled under perry
maybe paul s personal taxes doubled and he can show that s also perry s fault
later paul s campaign told us he d been referring at the debate to a doubling in his own franchise taxes
