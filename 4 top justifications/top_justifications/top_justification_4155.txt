Says Joe Biden said, "the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor."
no joe biden didn t say the germans bombed pearl harbor
even after the germans bombed pearl harbor
but we didn t find evidence that biden ever blamed germany for the pearl harbor bombing
nothing is over until we decide it is was it over when the germans bombed pearl harbor expletive no
in keith ellison then one of minnesota s congressmen said they attacked pearl harbor on fox news as bill o reilly talked about nazi germany
