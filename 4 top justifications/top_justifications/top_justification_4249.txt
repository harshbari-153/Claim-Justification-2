President Donald Trump "will evoke (sic) what is called the Stafford act" and "order a two week mandatory quarantine for the nation."
please be advised within to hours the president will evoke sic what is called the stafford act reads the post
the president will order a two week mandatory quarantine for the nation
the facebook post also says trump will soon invoke the stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act
that part is accurate the president announced the move in a letter to cabinet officials on march but it doesn t mean there will be nationwide quarantine
therefore as an initial step i hereby determine under section b of the stafford act that an emergency exists nationwide
