"John McCain intervened, which helped Airbus get that Pentagon contract."
then the announcer in the ad states and guess what john mccain intervened which helped airbus get that pentagon contract
so does that amount to intervening did it help airbus get the contract and did the promise of campaign contributions influence mccain
first the ad notes that mccain has accepted contributions from airbus executives and that former airbus lobbyists were working on his campaign
but to imply those letters swung the contract in airbus favor overstates mccain influence
john mccain as a politician who swung a lucrative defense contract to a european company over an american competitor
