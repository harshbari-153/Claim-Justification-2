"The Interior Department has only 30 days to review an exploration plan submitted by an oil company. That leaves no time for the appropriate environmental review. The result is, they are continually waived."
one example under current law the interior department has only days to review an exploration plan submitted by an oil company
that leaves no time for the appropriate environmental review
my suspicion is that as with all central planners congress doesn t know the proper amount of time it takes to review a project
changing this mandatory deadline to a timeline that can be further extended to complete environmental and safety reviews as needed would provide mms more time to conduct additional environmental analysis on an exploration plan the department said in its announcement
we wondered whether the president is correct that the law mandates such a short period for an environmental review
