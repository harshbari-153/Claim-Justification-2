"Twenty-four percent of doctors in Virginia currently donâ€™t accept new Medicaid patients because the reimbursement rates are so low."
percent of doctors in virginia currently don t accept new medicaid patients because the reimbursement rates are so low he said
schwartz said percent of doctors in virginia currently don t accept new medicaid patients because the reimbursement rates are so low
but they tell us that the proportion of all virginia doctors that did not accept new medicaid patients as schwartz framed his statement had to be slightly lower than percent
the second issue is that schwartz said all of the virginia doctors who declined new medicaid patients did so because the reimbursement rates are so low
of that national sample of doctors percent said they did not accept new medicaid patients
