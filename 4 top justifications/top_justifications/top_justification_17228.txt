brazile said the irs was looking at everybody including liberal groups and progressive groups
the irs also investigated liberal groups groups that have progressive in their name groups that had israel in its name
so the irs was basically looking at everybody because they were trying to figure out where all of this fake phony secretive money was flowing in the last election cycle
