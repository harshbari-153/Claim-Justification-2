"More than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals."
one of them was that more than percent of all food stamps are given to illegals
facebook post says more than percent of all food stamps are given to illegal immigrants
the first of the facebook post s claims that more than percent of all food stamps are given to illegals is ridiculously false
million people received food stamps so percent of that number would be slightly less than million
so it s mathematically impossible for more than percent of all food stamps to be given to illegals there simply aren t enough undocumented immigrants in the country to make the math work
