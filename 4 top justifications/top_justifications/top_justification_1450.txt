"When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him -- perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One."
when president obama landed in cuba on air force one no leader was there nobody to greet him perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of air force one
trump said when president obama landed in cuba on air force one no leader was there nobody to greet him perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of air force one
however trump exaggerates here when he says no leader was there nobody to greet him since cuba s foreign minister and other high government officials were present
indeed the white house said at the time said that it was never envisioned that one of the castros would come to the airport to greet air force one
so neither fidel castro the communist government s founding leader or raul castro his brother and successor was at the airport to greet obama
