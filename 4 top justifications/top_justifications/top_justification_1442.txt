Property taxes "are now 18% higher than when (Mark Sharpe) first took office."
property taxes are actually percent higher than when sharpe first took office said burgin who is seeking to unseat sharpe in the district republican primary
with fiscal year as the base year that means overall county property tax revenue has increased by nearly percent during sharpe s tenure
he sent us the numbers he used the overall property tax revenue figures for each of the years sharpe has been in office since
this is indeed significant because while this may be hard to remember with property values now plummeting home and business values were soaring during sharpe s first years in office
it was not until september that sharpe cast his first budgetary votes setting property tax rates for fiscal year
