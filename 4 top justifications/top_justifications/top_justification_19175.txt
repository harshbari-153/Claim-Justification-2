do you know that we have pipes carrying natural gas in this country that are made of wood i not joking
bill maher says that some natural gas pipes are made of wood
are there really wood pipes for natural gas in use today we decided to check
does this establish conclusively that there is no wooden pipe currently in use no it impossible to prove that without exposing every inch of the miles of natural gas pipe in the country
however our reporting suggests reasons to be skeptical of the claim that wood natural gas pipes are still in use today
