no facebook isn t censoring posts by removing the share button
the post features a large notice banner above the warning that says facebook is removing the share button from posts
a viral message shared on facebook warns users that the social media company is proactively removing the share button from any post that is in a front against freedom of speech
but when searching through content with public settings we could not find posts that didn t include a share button regardless of the nature of the post
tell facebook this is not acceptable in a free society
