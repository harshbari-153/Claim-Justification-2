Americans now "support strikes (against ISIS) but the support for ground troops is not there. The support is very thin."
it is also a stretch to say support for ground troops is not there or very thin
vanden heuvel said americans now support strikes to fight the islamic state but the support for ground troops is not there
asked if they would support or oppose ground troops in iraq and syria to fight the islamic state percent expressed some support while percent were against it
similarly cnn found of americans opposed ground troops while about supported it
on this week vanden heuvel embellished a bit when she said support for ground troops to fight the islamic state was not there and very thin but her general point is on target
