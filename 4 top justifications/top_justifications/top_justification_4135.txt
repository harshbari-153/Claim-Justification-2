"This is the slowest job recovery since Hoover."
this is the slowest job recovery since hoover
but it s inaccurate to say that it s the slowest job recovery since hoover
so by this measure romney s claim that this is the slowest job recovery since hoover is incorrect
mitt romney says we in the slowest job recovery since hoover
however we re taking romney at his literal word and he said the slowest job recovery which is the period after the recession has ended and the recovery has begun
