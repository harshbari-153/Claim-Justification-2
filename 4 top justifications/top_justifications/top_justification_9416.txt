Says a Congressional Budget Office report on spending by House Democrats in the economic stimulus concluded it "is just not stimulus. It won't help the economy grow."
unfortunately here on the hill what we seeing now is the congressional democrats proposed massive amounts of spending that in fact today the congressional budget office came out with a report said that it just not stimulus
what cantor cited is not so much a cbo report as a data run projecting how much of the proposed billion stimulus money proposed by house democrats for infrastructure projects like bridge highway or school construction and other discretionary spending would be going out the door in any given year
among the spending not analyzed is a proposed billion in tax cuts and nearly billion for jobless benefits both of which are expected by some to the economy more quickly than infrastructure projects
first as cantor acknowledged later in the fox interview the cbo analysis referenced by cantor only looked at discretionary spending not the entire billion stimulus package proposed by house leaders
last and perhaps most important the cbo data sheet makes absolutely no qualitative conclusions about whether infrastructure spending will stimulate the economy or whether it will or wo help the economy to grow
