People are attaching HIV-infected needles to gas station pump handles.
an old hoax that has resurfaced on facebook makes the claim that people are attaching needles to gas pump handles
while it is not entirely impossible for someone to attach a needle to a gas station pump the problem is not widespread
while it is not impossible for such a thing to take place the suggestion that infected needles are being hidden in gas pump handles in any widespread manner is fear mongering and inaccurate
the facebook post in question this time features a photo of a gas station pump handle and what appears to be a needle sticking out under it
cdc has received inquiries about a variety of reports or warnings about used needles left by injection drug users in coin return slots of pay phones the underside of gas pump handles and on movie theater seats
