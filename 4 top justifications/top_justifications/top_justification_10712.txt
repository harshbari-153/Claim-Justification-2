Under a Wisconsin bill, "minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws, seat belt laws, parking infractions, etc., would now be arrestable offenses."
the group said that under the bill minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws seat belt laws parking infractions etc
our conclusion the john birch society said that under a bill pending in the legislature minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws seat belt laws parking infractions etc
dog at large violations are already in communities that have such ordinances and seat belt and parking violations are statewide though the arrest typically does not involve handcuffs or jail but rather a person being detained or perhaps ending up with a fine
john birch society says wisconsin bill would let police arrest people for violating pet leash laws and other minor offenses
but a memo from the state legislative council which provides legal and other research services to the legislature said the bill provides law enforcement officers additional arrest authority for state civil forfeitures offenses prohibited by state law
