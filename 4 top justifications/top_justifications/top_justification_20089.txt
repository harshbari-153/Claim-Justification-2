it s the fence test begins a statement attributed to foxworthy
no jeff foxworthy didn t write this fence test
which side of the fence if you ve ever wondered which side of the fence you sit on this is a great test
back in january we a viral facebook post claiming that comedian jeff foxworthy authored a bit on how you know you live in a country that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots
there s no evidence foxworthy is behind the post and we couldn t find anything to support another claim that he wrote another round of political jokes taking aim at democrats
