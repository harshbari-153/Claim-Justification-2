Michael Bloomberg "did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis!"
and by the way he did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis
trump tweeted that bloomberg did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis
bloomberg however laid out his case for his experience handling crises as mayor in a television ad filmed in late february
bloomberg made his leadership skills a significant part of his argument for why voters should have considered him for the white house so we wondered about the president s criticism
it should be noted how bloomberg came into the mayor s office
