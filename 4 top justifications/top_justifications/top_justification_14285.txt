A new presidential helicopter "is now going to cost as much as Air Force One."
we all know that the cost overruns your helicopter is now going to cost as much as air force one
we wondered if it was true that the marine one presidential helicopter that carries passengers could cost as much as the huge version of the boeing that is specially built for the president
in fact he could have said the helicopter would cost more
the air force one cost comparison has been frequently cited by critics of the helicopter contract which has nearly doubled in cost since lockheed martin won it in
so this one boils down to a question of what you consider to be the cost of air force one
