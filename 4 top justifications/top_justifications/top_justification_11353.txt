remember that picture of barack obama s white house staff crying the day after trump won the election that s what a recent facebook post asks before claiming to identify one of the men in the photo as the alleged ukraine call whistleblower
the facebook post points to the man to the far right of the photo and describes him as the whistleblower who alleged trump is soliciting foreign interference from ukraine in the election
no this isn t a photo of the ukraine whistleblower
he tweeted another image claiming that he s the whistleblower
fake news edelman tweeted the nerd circled below is the whistleblower
