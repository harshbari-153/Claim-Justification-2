John McCain's health care plan "leaves you on your own to pay McCainâ€™s health insurance tax."
mccain health plan does not leave you on your own to pay mccain s health insurance tax
mccain would make you pay income tax on your health insurance benefits
and that tax credit mccain s own web site said it goes straight to the insurance companies not to you leaving you on your own to pay mccain s health insurance tax
but then the ad says mccain s own web site said it goes straight to the insurance companies not to you leaving you on your own to pay mccain s health insurance tax
so under mccain plan the tax exemption for employer provided health insurance would disappear and people would get a tax credit of per person for couples to spend on any health insurance they wish
