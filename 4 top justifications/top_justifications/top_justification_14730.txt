barack obama says he eliminated epa rule treating spilled milk like it was oil
our ruling obama said his administration got rid of a rule that regulated milk in the same manner as oil as an environmental hazard when spilled
in february the epa announced that it intended to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products
we got rid of one rule from years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend a year proving that they could contain a spill because milk was somehow classified as an oil obama said in the jan
according to the epa s website milk has been regulated under the spill prevention control and countermeasure program since when the clean water act took effect
