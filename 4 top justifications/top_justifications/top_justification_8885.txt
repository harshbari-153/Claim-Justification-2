"Two-thirds of Granite Staters oppose the Tea Party" and its agenda on labor unions.
buckley said of granite staters oppose the tea party and its agenda on labor unions
of granite staters oppose the tea party and romney s right to work for less agenda and even more oppose the gop plan to end medicare as we know it
but there are two major issues with buckley s claim first it suggests that of new hampshire voters oppose the tea party not just its agenda on labor issues
polls show buckley is correct in saying the tea party doesn t represent the majority of granite staters but to suggest that oppose the group is a big stretch
i can see what the democrats are trying to do but i don t think that saying that of people in new hampshire oppose the tea party accurately reflects public opinion smith said
