"Once a woman enters into the sex trade, her average life expectancy is seven years."
rebecca quigley said once a woman enters into the sex trade her average life expectancy is seven years
once a woman enters into the sex trade she said her average life expectancy is seven years with aids and homicide as the top killers
the truth is the vast majority of women who enter into prostitution leave the trade alive so to say a life expectancy of seven years
as retired call girl maggie mcneill noted last year in the washington post to say that the average life expectancy of all street workers or of all sex workers
when we tracked down the authors they said the actual life expectancy like so many statistics used in the prostitution debate is really known
