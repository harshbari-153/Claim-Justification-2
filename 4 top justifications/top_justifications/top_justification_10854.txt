If Wisconsin's governor cuts perquisites as much as he plans to do, "it would still leave (workers) better off than their private sector" counterparts.
george will says wisconsin governor benefits proposal would still leave workers better off than those in private sector
we decided to check will claim that perks or compensation such as health and retirement benefits if cut as much as wisconsin governor scott walker has proposed would still leave public employees better off than those in the private sector
and with regard to the changes walker has proposed requiring greater employee contributions to pension and health care will is right that they would still leave public employees better off than those in the private sector
so wisconsin public employees may be required to contribute more to the their retirement plan than those in the private sector but that does mean they at a disadvantage compared to the private sector
three hundred thousand public employees in wisconsin went to work while the teachers were clutching their little signs that say it all about the kids they abandoning their classrooms lying to their supervisors saying they were sick and going off to protest in defense of perquisites which if the governor cuts them as much as he plans to do would still leave them better off than their private sector counterparts
