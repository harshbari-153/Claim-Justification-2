When President Barack Obama "signed the executive order (on DACA, he) actually said he doesn't have the right to do this."
trump said that when obama signed the executive order on daca he acknowledged that he didn t have the right to do it
president obama when he signed the executive order actually said he does have the right to do this trump said jan
did obama say he did have the right to issue daca
the smaller errors in that statement are that obama didn t sign an executive order and that when he announced the new policy he didn t say that he lacked the authority
obama didn t say that he lacked the right to act
