Poor people pay "in some cases, up to 25 percent of (their) income for water."
damon said that poor people sometimes pay as much as percent of their income for water
the poor often pay more for water than the middle class
taken at face value he only said that some people pay as much as percent of their income on water
the poor often pay more for water than the middle class damon said
given that poor people pay an inordinate share of whatever money they have for basic needs and they tend to live in places where water costs more some people probably do spend as much as damon said
