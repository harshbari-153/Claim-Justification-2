"Joe Biden calls Pennsylvania voters who don’t support him ‘chumps.’"
joe biden calls pennsylvania voters who don t support him chumps the posts said
but the claim in the facebook post that biden calls pennsylvania voters who don t support him chumps gives the impression that biden was denouncing all such voters who don t cast a ballot for him
so biden did call some of trump s supporters chumps during a rally in pennsylvania
biden called trump supporters disrupting his rally chumps
recent facebook posts claimed democratic presidential nominee joe biden was caught insulting president donald trump s supporters but they took his comments out of context
