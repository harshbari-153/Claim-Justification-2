"There are 3 million jobs available in America that are not filled because too many of our people donâ€™t have the skills for those jobs."
there are million jobs available in america that are not filled because too many of our people don t have the skills for those jobs rubio said in his march speech
our ruling rubio said there are million jobs available in america that are not filled because too many of our people don t have the skills for those jobs
but rubio specifically said there are million jobs available in america that are not filled because too many of our people don t have the skills for those jobs
million jobs sitting vacant in part because there aren t enough qualified applicants to fill them
if one allows him some space for using shorthand rubio is basically right that there are million jobs available in america
