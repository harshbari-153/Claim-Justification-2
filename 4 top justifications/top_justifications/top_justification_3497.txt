"To be clear, all my investments are in a trust that I donâ€™t control."
to be clear all my investments are in a trust that i don t control
rauner said to be clear all my investments are in a trust that i don t control
he was not being clear when he said his investments were held in trust
in a blind trust like those used by federal officials an officeholder turns over ownership of financial interests to a trustee who is prohibited from communicating with the official on investment matters
but while rauner invoked blind trust procedures in his explanation the business arrangement he entered into was a power of attorney not a blind trust
