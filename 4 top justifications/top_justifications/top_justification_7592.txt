Wealthy taxpayers, not middle-income earners, get "most of the deductions" in the tax code.
ryan says wealthy taxpayers get most of the deductions in the tax code
the people who get most of the deductions are the people in the top tax brackets the wealthy not taxpayers ryan explained
our ruling ryan countering criticism of romney tax plan said that wealthy taxpayers not earners get most of the deductions in the tax code
in sheer numbers some tax deductions such as the mortgage interest deduction are claimed by far more and people than by people in the top brackets irs data shows
and so what we re saying is by getting rid of these deductions that higher income earners get more of their income is subject to taxation and that means we can lower tax rates for everybody
