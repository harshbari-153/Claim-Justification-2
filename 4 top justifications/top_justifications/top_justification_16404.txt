Cheney is "disagreeing with President Bush's policy. President Bush stated repeatedly to international audiences and to the country that he wanted to close Guantanamo."
president bush stated repeatedly to international audiences and to the country that he wanted to close guantanamo
but it not as simple as bush wanting to close gitmo and cheney wanting to keep it open
again that sounds like what cheney has been saying
so it is a complex problem and president bush was able to close guantanamo on his watch
it one thing to say you want to close gitmo cheney said last week but it tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america national security
