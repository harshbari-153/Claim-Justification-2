"We have one senator who’s a ‘yes’ vote ... but he’s in the hospital. And he’s a ‘yes’ vote. So we can’t do it by Friday. So we have the votes" to pass a health care bill.
we have one senator who s a yes vote a great person but he s in the hospital trump told fox friends in a sept
trump said senate republicans would have enough votes to pass health care reform but for a hospitalized senator who s unable to cast the deciding vote
we decided to look more closely at whether senate republicans in fact have the needed votes and if a hospitalized senator unable to cast his yes vote is preventing its passage
at most senate republicans have yes votes that s short of the majority they need to pass the latest health care overhaul
president donald trump claimed that senate republicans could pass a health care reform bill by the end of september if a senator s hospitalization weren t preventing him from casting the deciding vote
