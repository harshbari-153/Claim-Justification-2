President Barack Obama suggested on national TV that the Democratic health care bill "will have government decide" that a healthy, 100-year-old woman in need of a pacemaker "should take a pain pill" instead.
if we are being told that this week we have to make the decision as to whether or not the program we put forward will have government decide whether a woman who is in extraordinarily good health but needs a pacemaker ought to instead be told by the government that merely she should take a pain pill as the president suggested on television not too long ago then maybe we owe it to the american people to give ourselves sufficient time to study this legislation further
dan lungren a republican from california says president barack obama health care plan is so mixed up that the government would tell ladies who need pacemakers to take pain pills instead
lungren says obama would have government require a centenarian to get a pill not a pacemaker
one can be skeptical about whether obama s promises to keep the government out of decisionmaking will hold if health care legislation becomes a reality
while obama did bring up the example of patients and their families possibly having to choose between a pill and a pacemaker at some point he did it as a hypothetical example while emphasizing that the government s role should be to provide background information so that patients and doctors can better sort through thorny issues
