"Now (Biden) is saying that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine."
now biden is saying that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine said scalise the no
scalise said it is biden s policy that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine
claimed president joe biden was allowing unauthorized immigrants to move ahead of american citizens to get their vaccines
if you re an american citizen that s currently in a group that can t get the vaccine yet you re now behind in the line to an illegal immigrant in a group that can get one
but we wondered does allowing this population access to the vaccine mean they are being invited to step in front of american citizens in the queue
