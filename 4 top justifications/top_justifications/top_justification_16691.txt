"Let me say that I don't think (Bernie Sanders has) had a single negative ad ever run against him."
clinton said let me say that i do think sanders has had a single negative ad ever run against him
let me say that i do think he had a single negative ad ever run against him
hillary clinton wrong that no negative ads have hit bernie sanders
clinton has a point that compared with her sanders hasn t really felt the burn of negative ad blitzes from republican groups
the number of attack ads against sanders pales in comparison to the number against clinton but she s wrong that he s been completely spared
