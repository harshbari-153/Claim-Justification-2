"Today, you have six financial institutions, the largest six, that have assets that are the equivalent of 60 percent of the GDP of the United States of America."
ed today you have six financial institutions the largest six that have assets that are the equivalent of percent of the gdp of the united states of america sanders said
here are the top six and their total assets
and he s careful to say only that the banks assets are only equivalent to percent of the united states gdp not that the banks own percent of the united states
all of these dwarf the combined holdings of the top six banks in the u
dividing these top banks assets by the national gdp produces a result of percent which is actually a slightly larger percentage than sanders had indicated but certainly in the ballpark
