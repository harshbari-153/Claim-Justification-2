Says Gov. Tony Evers is "pushing firearm confiscation orders"
a story now circulating again on facebook says evers is pushing firearm confiscation orders
pushing firearm confiscation orders
no gov tony evers is not pushing gun confiscation old claim was wrong then is ridiculous now
but it offers zero proof for that claim or the headline reference to the governor pushing firearm confiscation orders
and more importantly red flag laws are a far cry from the implication this headline gives of some form of widespread gun confiscation
