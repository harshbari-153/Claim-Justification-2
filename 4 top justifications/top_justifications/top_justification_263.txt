Says he "was the only Republican" to vote against creating a House panel to investigate Planned Parenthood.
jolly said he was the only republican to vote against creating a house panel to investigate planned parenthood
i was the only republican to vote no he said
when my side of the aisle asked for an investigation of planned parenthood i actually voted no
technically the investigation jolly is talking about doesn t mention planned parenthood by name but the indian shores republican was the lone member of his party to oppose it
the reason he voted no he said is because the house already had three investigations into planned parenthood s alleged sale of fetal tissue
