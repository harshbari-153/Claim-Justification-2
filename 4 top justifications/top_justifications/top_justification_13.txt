"At least 450,000 ballots in the key states ... miraculously only have a mark for Joe Biden on them, and no other candidate."
we have identified at least ballots in the key states that miraculously only have a mark for joe biden on them and no other candidate
powell said at least ballots in the key states that miraculously only have a mark for joe biden on them and no other candidate
we don t see evidence that all of these votes were for biden however
sidney powell s claim that ballots in key states were marked only for biden
those who are falsely claiming potential fraud because of ballots marked only for biden need to report how many ballots they found marked only for trump and no other candidate it would likely be a similarly high number speel said
