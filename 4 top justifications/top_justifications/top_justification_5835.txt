"Financed the largest parking expansion program without a rate increase."
in a breakdown of projects and programs it offers this statement on page under public works financed the largest parking expansion program without a rate increase
but the greco campaign statement that under his last administration the city financed the largest parking expansion program without a rate increase fails to mention the rate increase that took place immediately after he left office
we decided to check the statement that the city managed a expansion of its parking system without increasing rates
greco also makes a larger point that the expansion of the city parking system was not only necessary but helped drive a broader economic expansion
petersburg times reported that revenue from the city parking system would provide the money to repay the bonds and city officials do not anticipate that the expansion would force them to raise parking rates
