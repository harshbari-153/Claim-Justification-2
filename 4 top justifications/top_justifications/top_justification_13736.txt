"President Biden has created more jobs in his first 7 months than any POTUS in history."
president biden has created more jobs in his first months than any potus in history
for the purpose of this we re going to focus on the first part of that tweet that biden has created more jobs than any other president in his first seven months in office
moore claimed that biden has created more jobs in his first months than any potus in history
biden has overseen a large increase in jobs but he s not really the one creating them
in any case the job growth began before biden took office
