"Romneycare has â€¦ killed 18,000 Massachusetts jobs."
here we re checking the ad s claim that romneycare killed massachusetts jobs
the ad says that the massachusetts health law killed jobs which makes it sound like actual jobs were eliminated
more significantly the perry ad says that the health care plan killed jobs
to review what the ad calls romneycare is a health care plan romney signed into law in
finally this claim also made us think of a report from the nonpartisan congressional budget office which conducted an economic analysis of how many jobs might be lost or gained nationwide under the new federal health care law
