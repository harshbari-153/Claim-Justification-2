"We don't need a separate (prescription drug) database ... Pharmacies already have a database in place."
the databases we use store prescription records in the pharmacy
it is true that many of the major chain pharmacies have prescription databases that are shared under their corporate umbrella pharmacies however they are not interconnected with other pharmacies jackson said
there are many databases that collect information on prescription drug purchases but those databases are not interconnected and were not created with the idea of reducing prescription drug abuse statewide
pharmacies already have a database in place and the transaction is recorded on the spot
the statewide database would allow pharmacists and physicians to track the sale of prescription drugs and pain medication in order to prevent patients from going doctor to doctor to acquire prescriptions
