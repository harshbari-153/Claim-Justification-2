"Last month, 44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate."
last month he said of the states saw an increase in the unemployment rate
our ruling walker s statement that last month of the states saw an increase in the unemployment rate is accurate but it lacks some important context
according to bls only of the states with a rise in unemployment between june and july had increases that were statistically significant
using this methodology there were states with statistically significant changes of which saw the unemployment rate decrease
and the fact that each of the statistically significant changes in the unemployment was upward supports the point
