Gov. Rick Scott "backed the federal shutdown."
the florida democratic party said that scott backed the federal shutdown
did rick scott back the federal government shutdown
this fall scott even backed the federal shutdown that cost floridians millions each day and pushed america to the brink of default
scott didn t get a vote on the federal shutdown so the only way to judge whether he backed it is by reading his words
instead scott used the shutdown as a chance to criticize obama and call for reducing federal spending and debt
