Sarah Palin was repeating "Abraham Lincoln's words" in discussing the war in Iraq.
we decided to compare palin words and lincoln words to see if palin words were a repeat of abraham lincoln
palin that a repeat of abraham lincoln words when he said first he suggested never presume to know what god will is and i would never presume to know god will or to speak god words but what abraham lincoln had said and that a repeat in my comments was let us not pray that god is on our side in a war or any other time
in the video palin is speaking informally to a group of students talking about her family and discussing current events
lincoln is also rebuking a clergyman inflated sense of moral piety while palin appears to be expressing solidarity with fellow believers
palin and lincoln words are similar in that they both express a hope that a plan meets with god favor
