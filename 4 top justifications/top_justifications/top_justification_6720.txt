nearly percent of the women who receive health screenings through this program do so at a planned parenthood health center said a commentary in the march austin by austin state reps
democratic legislators say nearly of women who get health screenings through the women s health program do so at planned parenthood
the democratic legislators wrote that nearly percent of women who received health screenings through the targeted program in fiscal had them at planned parenthood clinics
she said the agency told her that in fiscal about percent of clients in the state s women s health program had received services from planned parenthood which we noticed is a wider description than the legislators reference solely to health screenings
and if the number were large enough the percentage of women in the program who received their screenings exclusively from a planned parenthood clinic would be smaller than percent
