The White House doctored a photo of a Donald Trump event "to make the crowd look bigger."
the white house doctored the image to make the crowd look bigger the post claimed
someone did a lousy job of doctoring a photo of president donald trump s july tampa fla
the facebook post included one photo the user said was from the media showing a modest gathering and another one with clear evidence of manipulation said to be from the white house and depicting a thick crowd
no white house didn t release a doctored image of trump s airport crowd
but it turns out the doctored image borrowed from the twitter user was the work of a prankster trying to make a joke out of the president s sensitivities about crowd size
