clinton said jones said that the victims of the sandy hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there
even said and this really just is so disgusting he even said the victims of the sandy hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there
i will not let you down the story said going on to say jones had historically insisted various national tragedies were inside jobs and reporter william finnegan wrote jones believes that no one was actually hurt at sandy hook those were actors
episode of the show jones cited a story on the infowars webpage that day headlined fbi says no one killed at sandy hook
a moment later jones went on they can t find anywhere where i have said that i know the kids killed at sandy hook were actors or that it didn t happen and furthermore he said he s been criticized by conspiracy theorists who maintain the sandy hook events were fake because i don t buy into that
