Claims Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said: "It is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets."
activist ed garvey says wisconsin senate majority leader scott fitzgerald said it is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets
in a capital times opinion column about walker s bill garvey attributed this quote to one of the state s top republicans senate majority leader scott fitzgerald it is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets
so how does this all shake out in an opinion column garvey attributed this quote to republican senate majority leader scott fitzgerald it is necessary to eliminate unions in order to balance future budgets
we re looking at the quote garvey attributes to fitzgerald that it is necessary to eliminate unions to balance future budgets
but some of his critics seem certain that what walker and other republican leaders really want is to get rid of public employee unions entirely
