The IRS is taking money away from people who received unemployment benefits.
does receiving unemployment benefits mean the irs could take away your tax refund
the irs stopped collecting income taxes on most unemployment benefits collected in but started collecting them again in the tax year
a facebook post suggested that a tax refund could be reduced because someone received unemployment benefits
it appears that in the case of this facebook post based on the screenshot from the irs app and the poster s own words someone who received unemployment benefits then had their income tax refund reduced because of an unpaid debt
they told us that if the unemployment benefits were properly claimed a taxpayer would not have to pay them back but would be liable for income taxes on the amount they received
