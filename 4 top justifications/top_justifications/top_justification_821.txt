Obama plans "a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year."
obama wants to increase taxes by rolling back the bush tax cuts on people making more than if single or if married filing jointly
that seems designed to make the average viewer think that obama wants to raise taxes on people making that amount which is true
obama tax plan hits and up

it a gross distortion of obama proposals to say they would raise taxes on everyone who earns that much and we rate mccain claim false
