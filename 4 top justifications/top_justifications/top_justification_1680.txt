but the focus of that comment was on the plan and did not support sanford claim that she said this particular bill wo actually stimulate the economy
the article focused on concerns by some democrats that the stimulus package may fall short in its broader goal of transforming the american economy over the long term
she said she believed the bulk of the bill was an effective stimulus to the economy but that she wished the smaller portion of the bill aimed at investment had been discussed longer
