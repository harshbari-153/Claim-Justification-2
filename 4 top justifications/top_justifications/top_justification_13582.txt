"If Barack Obama would apply for a job with the FBI or with the Secret Service, he would be disqualified because of his past associations with William Ayers."
if barack obama would apply for a job with the fbi or with the secret service he would be disqualified because of his past associations with william ayers a known and unrepentant terrorist
barack obama is not eligible for fbi or secret service jobs because of his acquaintance with former antiwar radical william ayers
so we asked outside experts whether ayers would pose a problem for obama
still that says little about how obama would fare in a background check since none is required for either job
the more detailed iterations of the internet rumor allege obama would have to disclose his past connections to ayers on the form particularly in a section titled association record
