He "stood up to Barack Obama by passing legislation that prevents you from being forced to join government health plans or buy health insurance against your will."
this year judson stood up to barack obama by passing legislation that prevents you from being forced to join government health plans or buy health insurance against your will
state senator said he fighting obama on health care
hill fired back with a mailer that reminded his constituents about early voting and announced that senator judson hill is standing up to barack obama socialist healthcare
does the state law really prevent you from being forced to join government health plans republicans spent months in congress unsuccessfully arguing that democrats health efforts would infringe upon individual liberties and hurt the quality of care
while it true that sb did stand up to the health care overhaul it far from clear that the law can actually be enforced
