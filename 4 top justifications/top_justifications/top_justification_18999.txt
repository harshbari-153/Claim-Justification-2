we wanted to examine the group s claim that nelson used six cows and a loophole to dodge in his taxes
he leased land that he owned for six cows taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge in taxes just last year says the ad from american crossroads the conservative super pac founded by karl rove

the group emphasizes that nelson is leasing the land though the times story is clear he does not charge for the melbourne farmer to graze cows there
it s accurate to say that nelson was shielded from paying about in property taxes because of his land has a greenbelt designation
