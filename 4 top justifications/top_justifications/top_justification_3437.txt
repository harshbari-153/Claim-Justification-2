"Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled state legislature have added over $140 million in new special interest spending"
scott walker and the state legislature have added over million in new special interest spending
one wisconsin now says scott walker and the legislature have increased spending by million
we asked scot ross one wisconsin now s executive director how his organization could say the state would be spending million when the effect of the three bills would be that the state would have million less to spend
scott walker likely will tout some of his early legislative victories
see a pattern here the bills in question don t create any expenditures those are done in budget bills which walker has yet to introduce
