"The birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!"
just remember the birther movement was started by hillary clinton in
did hillary clinton start the obama birther movement
trump said that clinton started the birther movement and was all in
did clinton not just start the birther movement but back it wholeheartedly by being all in
it s an interesting bit of history that the birther movement appears to have begun with democrats supporting clinton and opposing obama
