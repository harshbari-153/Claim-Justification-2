"Fifteen years ago, you couldn't even get a pizza delivered in that neighborhood."
renteria said that years ago you couldn t get a pizza delivered in his neighborhood just east of downtown austin
fifteen years ago he said you could even get a pizza delivered in that neighborhood
we see a dash of truth here not every pizza place delivered there at the time and earlier into the you evidently couldn t get a pizza delivered at all
down the street from renteria s home we spoke with ernest vargas who said he couldn t recall ever not being able to get a pizza delivered
jane rivera said you can safely say that at least up until in all of east austin you could not get pizza delivered
