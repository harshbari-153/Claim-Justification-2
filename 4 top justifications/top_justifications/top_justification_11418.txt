A video clip from the Notre Dame cathedral fire shows a man walking alone in a tower of the church "dressed in Muslim garb."
a video clip posted on social media showed a man walking alone in one of notre dame s towers dressed in muslim garb
the clip shows a man walking in one of the cathedral s towers not long after the fire started
no there was not a man dressed in muslim garb walking in a notre dame tower during the fire
the clip is from an authentic media live stream of the notre dame fire but displays a and cropped version that doesn t allow the viewer to clearly see it was a firefighter
a low quality video was the basis of the bogus claim that a mysterious man in a yellow vest was in a tower
