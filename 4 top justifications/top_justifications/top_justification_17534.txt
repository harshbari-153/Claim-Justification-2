The economic stimulus bill created a council that's "modeled after the national board that controls Britainâ€™s health system."
this federal council is modeled after the national board that controls britain health system
health board in the stimulus bill not meant to imitate britain
the ad is correct that the stimulus bill includes language creating the federal coordinating council for comparative effectiveness research
getting back to the ad it is right that the economic stimulus bill created the federal coordinating council for comparative effectiveness research
but the ad is wrong that it is modeled after the national board that controls britain s health system
