"The president has added close to 68,000 troops in the last year, since he came into office, not just the 30,000 you hear, but the others that were added before that."
powell did give a yes or no answer instead explaining the president has added close to troops in the last year since he came into office not just the you hear but the others that were added before that
so troops were added to it
the challenge here and the president will have to face this late next year as he said he would is okay we have had this additional input of soldiers bringing it to over soldiers
obama took office with about troops
with those troops plus other additions the total deployment steadily increased from the roughly that were in afghanistan when obama took office
