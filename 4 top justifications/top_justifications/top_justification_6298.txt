Says Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger "faces espionage charges."
a facebook post claimed raffensperger faces espionage charges
call was recorded and leaked to the news media also spurred a claim that raffensperger faces espionage charges
the idea that raffensperger should face espionage act charges is absurd and outrageous
no grounds for claim that raffensperger could face spy charges over trump call
neither the article nor the tweet cites any evidence that raffensperger is facing espionage charges
