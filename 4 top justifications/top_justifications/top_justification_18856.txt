"Attorney General Eric Holder is involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges" against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation
but because attorney general eric holder is involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges the situation takes on some importance
and other fox commentators have confused the issue by suggesting holder and the obama administration made the call not to pursue more serious charges against the new black panther party members
on january a couple weeks before obama took office the department of justice filed a civil action in federal court accusing the two men as well as the new black panther party and its leader malik zulu shabazz of engaging in voter intimidation
in order to have violated the statute in question the new black panther party which is not affiliated with the original black panther party would have had to direct a campaign of intimidation and perez noted that while the organization had posted a notice that members of the party would be deployed at polling places on election day the philadelphia location where king samir shabazz was stationed was the only one where an incident occurred
for several weeks fox news pundits have been hammering the obama administration for its handling of the new black panther party voter intimidation case
