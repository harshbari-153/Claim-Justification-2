McCain "hasn't held executive responsibility."
but still clark who ran for president in was incorrect to say that mccain has held executive responsibility
house of representatives and in the senate but mccain has not been a mayor a governor or a chief executive
john mccain military experience does not necessarily qualify him to be president
his tenure at the rag shows that mccain not only held an executive post in which he managed a staff of and oversaw a fleet of planes but he earned positive reviews for his performance
clark larger point is correct mccain has accomplished a lot in his storied military and political career but he has relatively little executive experience
