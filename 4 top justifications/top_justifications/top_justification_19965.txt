"This is the same (farm) bill we voted on a few weeks ago, with the exception of one or two sentences."
boehner said this is the same bill we voted on a few weeks ago with the exception of one or two sentences
was that bill really the same bill with the exception of a few sentences
did the bill do that in just one or two sentences no
but the bill that we got on the floor is the same bill that was on the floor about three weeks ago with the exception of one or two sentences
speaker why did you use an emergency rule to get the farm bill down on the floor and does this violate what you were just saying that members should have time to read these bills this is a bill that now on the floor of the house of representatives
