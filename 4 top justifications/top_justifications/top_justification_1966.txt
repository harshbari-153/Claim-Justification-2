Under the American Health Care Act "people with pre-existing conditions are protected."
an ad by the american action network says that under the american health care act people with conditions are protected
while ahca has some language that is intended to protect those with conditions health care experts have previously told us that the legislation would allow insurance companies to charge more for people with conditions
the affordable care act adopted in prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher premiums because a person has a medical condition
the legislation would allow states to obtain waivers to some requirements of the affordable care act including the essential health benefits
the only kernel of truth here is that the amendment has language that states insurers can t limit access to coverage for individuals with conditions
