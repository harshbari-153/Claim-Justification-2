The passage of the teacher tenure bill in the Fla. Legislature was like the health care bill in Congress because one party jammed it through.
opportunities for input the federal health care bill included lengthy debate in both the house and senate with each chamber passing a bill incorporating that body priorities
compare that with the state teacher tenure bill
in vetoing sb he said the process in the legislature was similiar to the one republicans criticized democrats for using in washington to pass the health care bill
crist said the passage of sb reminded him of how the health care bill played out in washington
but turns out there actually was more debate in washington about the health care bill than there was in tallahassee about sb
