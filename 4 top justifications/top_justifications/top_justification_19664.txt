"Oregon is spending $10 million advertising Obamacare with ads that don’t even mention the program and how to enroll in it" and that don’t "mention the word ‘insurance.’"
chapter nine millions spent building promoting an insurance plan few want and a website that doesn t work said this oregon is spending million advertising obamacare with advertisements that don t even mention the program or how to enroll in it
is cover oregon spending million advertising obamacare with ads that do even mention
did cover oregon spend million for television ads that didn t mention the word insurance politifact oregon checked
com story which reported that cover oregon s new ad campaign cost million
so we have disagreement on omission of the word insurance in cover oregon s first advertisements
