Says he cut 'tax rates five times'
white says he cut tax rates five times
for those five years the tax rate dropped from
summing up white is right that the city property tax rate was cut five years in a row on his watch and in houston where the mayor has substantial power his claim of responsibility is warranted
however in four of those five years the city adopted a tax rate that still brought in more revenue than it had the year before
but lowering the tax rate does always mean that property owners tax bills go down
