"Putin Vows to ‘Crush’ Child Traffickers in Ukraine"
putin vows to crush child traffickers in ukraine read what looked like a headline in a screenshot shared march on facebook
and while putin has been very descriptive about his reasons for invading ukraine child trafficking has never been mentioned
it would make little sense for russia to attempt to crush child trafficking in ukraine as it has a more serious problem with human trafficking than its neighbor according to the state department s latest trafficking in persons report
there is no evidence that putin s decision to wage war in ukraine has been motivated by a desire to rid the country of child trafficking
in one of those events putin claimed that ethnic russians living in areas of ukraine controlled by russian separatists have been literally tortured by constant shelling and blockades and that they were forced to seek shelter in their basements where they now live with their children
