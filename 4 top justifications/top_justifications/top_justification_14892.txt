John McCain would "reduce oversight of health insurance."
mccain just published an article praising wall street deregulation said he d reduce oversight of the health insurance industry too
first is the question of whether or not mccain wants to reduce oversight of the health care industry
mccain is adapting a health care proposal long championed by conservatives in congress and by the bush administration that would allow insurers to bypass coverage mandates for certain types of treatments and procedures such as diabetes care and cancer screenings
seizing on the spirit of the times barack obama is accusing john mccain of preparing to eliminate regulations governing the sale of health insurance in a continuation of what obama contends are the regulatory policies of the bush administration
mccain certainly is on record supporting less state regulation of health insurance which would reduce coverage mandates and put more of an onus on consumers to shop for the best deals
