Romney "would turn Medicare into a voucher program."
obama says romney wants to turn medicare into a voucher program
and the essence of the plan is that you would turn medicare into a voucher program
generally we think voucher program is a fair way of describing to voters the vision for medicare under a administration
president barack obama wasted little time deriding mitt romney s medicare plan as a voucher program while talking entitlements in the first presidential debate
in the past politifact has found obama s voucher characterization reasonable though as obama noted republicans prefer premium support
