bloggers say gov scott walker is taking a pay raise while freezing salaries for state employees
scott walker s state employee pay plan which calls for no pay raises for state workers for the next two years fell along party lines
our conclusion bloggers dug into the pay plan proposed by walker and found what sure looked like the ultimate hypocrisy the governor giving himself a raise while freezing state workers pay for two years
the pay raise took effect when walker took office
democrats and union leaders complained the pay freeze came on the heels of legislation passed by walker and the legislature that requires state workers to pay more for the health insurance and pensions
