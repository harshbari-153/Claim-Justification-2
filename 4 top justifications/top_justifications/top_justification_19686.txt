Says "some [states] with the largest reductions in crime have also lowered their prison population."
while crime fell in nearly every state over the past seven years some of those with the largest reductions in crime have also lowered their prison population
the pew research showed four of the states with the greatest drops in crime were also among the top states in lowering their incarceration rates
gingrich and nolan argued that some states with major reductions in crime have also had large drops in their incarceration rate
seven of the states with the lowest crime rates also had among the lowest incarceration rates
wouldn t the reason why some states have less crime is because more criminals are in prison a gingrich spokesman pointed to data from states such as texas to make the former speaker s case
