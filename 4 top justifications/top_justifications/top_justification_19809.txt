Says. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, once said, "Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up."
a social media meme says barton once said wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up
third the meme overlooks that when barton supposedly said that harnessing the wind would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up he was actually asking the witness a question rather than stating his view
a reader recently sent us a meme featuring a picture of barton alongside the quotation wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up
the paper ultimately referenced by barton the one that keith coauthored found some intriguing interactions between wind turbines and climate namely that very large amounts of wind power can produce changes to climate at continental scales
barton s comments are somewhat meandering but the general gist of what he said was to raise questions about some of the downsides of using wind to generate electricity
