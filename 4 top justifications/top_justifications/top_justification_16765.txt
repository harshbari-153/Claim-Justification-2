Says former President Barack Obama "took similar action against Cuban refugees" as President Donald Trump did in his executive order.
said that obama took similar action against cuban refugees as trump did in his executive order
i am struck by the double standard and hypocrisy of those who are offended by this executive order but who failed to challenge president obama when he took similar action against cuban refugees especially since president obama s action was meant to appease the castro regime and not for national security reasons wrote in a statement to the press jan
trump s order which singled out immigrants from seven countries and refugees from everywhere was far more broad than obama s administrative rule change to put cubans on more equal footing with arrivals from other countries
is trump immigration ban comparable to obama cuba rule change
mario a republican whose district includes parts of defended trump s ban by comparing it with an action president barack obama took on cuban refugees in his final days in office
