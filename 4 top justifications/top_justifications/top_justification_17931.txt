Mitt Romney is worth "at least a quarter billion dollars" and the bulk of his wealth "remains in blind trusts and overseas bank accounts."
the bulk of mitt romney s personal wealth remains in blind trusts and overseas bank accounts
our ruling winning our future s movie puts romney s personal fortune at million and says most of it remains in blind trusts and overseas bank accounts
so the video is correct in stating that much of romney s wealth is in a blind trust all but about
so the king of bain narrator s statement that romney is now worth somewhere over a quarter of a billion dollars goes right for the high end of the range cited by the washington post
romney s own financial statement shows his personal fortune to be at least a quarter billion dollars
