Texas "children may have a teacher who never spent one minute practicing teaching."
mike villarreal says that texas students may have a teacher who has never practiced teaching
parents are shocked when i tell them that their children may have a teacher who never spent one minute practicing teaching but is now responsible for educating a classroom full of kids villarreal said in a nov
we should hand the classroom over to a teacher who has never stood in front of a class and taught a lesson
we did not find a precise count of teachers in austin or texas public schools who started without teaching practice though significantly it undisputed that schools can and do hire teachers lacking even a minute of experience teaching a class
debbie ratcliffe a tea spokeswoman told us the agency does not keep information on how many individuals never taught before becoming classroom teachers
