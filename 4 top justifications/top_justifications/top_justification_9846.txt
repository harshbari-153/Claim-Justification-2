"Two members of the Senate," Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, "voted more with my Republican friends" than with the president from their own party.
biden said that two senators manchin and sinema voted more with my republican friends than with the president from their own party
however in his tulsa remarks biden was wrong to say that manchin and sinema or any other senate democrat for that matter voted more with republicans than with biden
but on actual votes taken in the senate both manchin and sinema supported biden s position of the time
there is absolutely no way those two are voting more with republicans than with biden said utah state university political scientist josh ryan a specialist in congress
that said ryan added manchin and sinema wo do the big thing democrats want to do now which is get rid of the filibuster
