Says Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on his support for President Reaganâ€™s policies.
our ruling the dnc ad casts romney as a on his support for the policies of former president reagan
that failing reagan romney said holding up reagan as the standard to which republicans should aspire
another topic on which the dnc says romney pulled a switcharoo his support for former president ronald reagan
dnc calls out romney s evolving affection for reagan
and again in that speech romney approvingly quoted reagan taking a jab at the left recalling reagan s words it isn t that liberals are ignorant it s just that what they know is wrong
