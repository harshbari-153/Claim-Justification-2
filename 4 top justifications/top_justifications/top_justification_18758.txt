McCain is "selectively editing Joe Biden's words...Biden actually said about Barack Obama: 'They're gonna find out this guy's got steel in his spine.'"
but here what biden actually said about barack obama gon na find out this guy got steel in his spine
did biden actually say obama had steel in his spine yes but a day earlier than he made the comments the mccain ad highlighted not immediately afterward as the obama ad claimed
so the obama campaign took biden words out of context even as they accused the mccain campaign of that very sin
and john mccain playing with audio tapes selectively editing joe biden words
so the mccain campaign omitted crucial context but did exactly turn biden meaning on its head either
