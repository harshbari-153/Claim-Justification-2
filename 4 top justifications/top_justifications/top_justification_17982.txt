A photo shows Marjorie Taylor Greene wearing a Soviet shirt and giving a Nazi salute.
photo altered to look like it s marjorie taylor greene wearing a soviet shirt and raising arm
in what looks like the original image it s clear that it s not greene but rather another person pictured raising her arm
in the image it appears as if greene is wearing a soviet and a pair of underwear outside of her pants
it appears that greene s face has been superimposed on the face of the person in the photo
she is also raising one of her arms in a way some people think looks like a nazi salute but could also be interpreted as a superhero pose as she s also wearing a cape
