Says Marco Rubio is proposing a new $1 trillion "welfare program" in tax credits and "$1 trillion in new military spending."
paul said rubio is proposing a new trillion welfare program and trillion in new military spending
but is rubio proposing a new trillion welfare program and trillion in new military spending and trillion over what period of time
is it conservative to have trillion in transfer payments a new welfare program that a refundable tax credit add that to marco plan for trillion in new military spending and you get something that looks to me not very conservative
marco rubio proposes trillion boosts in welfare and defense gop white house rival rand paul says
paul s characterization of rubio s tax credit as welfare is a stretch however
