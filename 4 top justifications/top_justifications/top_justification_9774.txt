The home-mortgage deduction is widely thought to be "a middle-class benefit. It's not -- 73 percent of it goes to people making a quarter-million dollars or more a year."
do percent of benefits from mortgage deduction go to those earning a year
typically such tax breaks provide financial assistance to identifiable groups of people homeowners in the case of the deduction
coburn s concern was that the deduction disproportionately benefits richer homeowners rather than homeowners
it would seem to make sense that richer homeowners would benefit from this deduction more than homeowners would if only because the richer you are the more expensive your house will likely be and therefore the more you will tend to pay in interest
in reality percent of the deduction benefits go to those making a little over a year not a year
