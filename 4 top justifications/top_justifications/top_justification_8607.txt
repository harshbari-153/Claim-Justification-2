"A rural hospital in Missouri closes every 8 months. The legislature’s failure to expand Medicaid has brought crisis to many of Missouri’s rural health care providers."
the legislature s failure to expand medicaid has brought crisis to many of missouri s rural health care providers
in a graphic posted on instagram koster s campaign wrote the legislature s failure to expand medicaid has brought crisis to many of missouri s rural health care providers
since many rural hospitals were already in crisis before because of a large burden of uninsured patients the failure to expand medicaid isn t the direct cause for closings
koster said a rural hospital in missouri closes every months
since missouri opted out of medicaid expansion this left the hospital with a gap in reimbursement
