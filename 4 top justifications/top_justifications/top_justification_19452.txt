Obama "changed the rules in Washington. Gone are the free gifts from lobbyists. Gone are the fancy airplane rides for nothing."
and to be sure obama backed the law which barred gifts from lobbyists and required that a senator flying on a corporate jet reimburse the plane owner at the full charter rate
gone are the free gifts from lobbyists
but obama was not the leading player on the new law
but to imply obama was the leading force behind the ethics law goes too far
gone are the fancy airplane rides for nothing
