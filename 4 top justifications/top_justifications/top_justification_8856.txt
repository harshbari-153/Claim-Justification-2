The World Health Organization "now admits that asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 is very rare."
a june facebook post says the world health organization now admits that asymptomatic transmission of is very rare
a facebook post claimed the who now admits that asymptomatic transmission of is very rare
and i think that that s a misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare
maria van kerkhove the who technical lead for said that asymptomatic spread is very rare
it still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward
