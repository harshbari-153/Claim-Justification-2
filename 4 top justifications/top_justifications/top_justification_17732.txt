The Mormon religion has "a plan that will see the Constitution thrown out and replaced by a theocracy."
in the interest of brevity we confined ourselves to checking the false contention that the mormon faith has a devious plan for our country that advocates the overthrow of the constitution in favor of a government run by mormon religious authorities
as for the facts behind the claim that the mormon religion wants to see the constitution revoked and the government run by mormon religious leaders we find a decided lack of concrete evidence
and if you going to have a mormon theocracy who going to lead it mitt romney or harry reid from nevada asked cromartie
we checked official teachings from the mormon church and found that it has an policy of political neutrality
he agreed that overthrowing the constitution is not part of current mormon teaching and would happen overnight
