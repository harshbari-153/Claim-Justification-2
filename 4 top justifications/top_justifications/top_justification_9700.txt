The Georgia Secretary of State's Office and the Georgia State Elections Board investigate and penalize hundreds of people guilty of election fraud.
i can attest that every year we investigate and penalize hundreds of people guilty of election and voter fraud georgia secretary of state brian kemp wrote the washington post in june
those in charge of enforcing the law counter that it helps prevent voter fraud
could the state really have investigated and handed out fines in so many more cases each year matt carrothers a spokesman for the georgia secretary of state s office sent us numbers outlining how many cases the state elections board reviewed in and along with the number of investigations kemp s office has opened
in june politifact georgia checked out a claim by kemp that the elections board had handed out about in fines for violations of georgia s absentee ballot law
some say georgia s stricter policies on voter id are a way to keep the poor and racial minorities from voting
