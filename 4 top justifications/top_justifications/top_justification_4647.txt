The Democrats' health care bills would end "the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition," while the Republican bill would not.
rather than outlawing such denials by insurance companies the republican bill would instead make sure that those with conditions have access to coverage somewhere
most observers would agree that pelosi is correct that the house bill which passed her chamber narrowly last year does indeed end the denial of coverage for those who have a condition though not without some caveats
still pelosi is correct that under the gop plan insurers would still be able to deny coverage to those with conditions
the second is that while it impossible to know whether the republican approach would succeed or fail it clear that many health experts are skeptical about the gop ability to provide coverage to all or virtually all of those who have conditions
the democrats have that in their bill
