Because the EPA closed a lead smelter in Missouri, "all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!"
lead bullets will have to come from overseas after epa closed smelter chain email says
a chain email said that following closure of a lead smelter in missouri all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas
we wondered is the email correct to say that all lead for bullets will now have to come from overseas
why thanks to obama s environmental protection agency epa we can no longer smelt lead from ore in the united states
now that the doe run primary smelter has been shuttered for a few months we checked back with ammunition experts to see whether there s any evidence that all lead for bullets now comes from overseas
