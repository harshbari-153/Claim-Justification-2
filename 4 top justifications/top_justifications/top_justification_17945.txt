"I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war (in Iraq), and yes, even before the war ever started."
on the iraq war trump said i was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war and yes even before the war ever started
though i was not in government service i was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war and yes even before the war ever started trump said
this goes directly against trump s claims that he criticized the rush to war before the war began
but does this prove trump prove was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war
there s no evidence though that he advocated against the war in the first place or that he was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war
