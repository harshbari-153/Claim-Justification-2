"Taxpayers even footed the bill for Perryâ€™s trip to a bachelor party in Las Vegas."
the one that immediately grabbed our attention was taxpayers even footed the bill for perry s trip to a bachelor party in las vegas
did the governor experience sin city on the taxpayers dime to support the statement in the video the hutchison campaign referred us to a dallas morning news item about a visit that perry paid to las vegas in october
it appears that the perry campaign paid for the commercial flight that the governor took to las vegas
but hutchison statement in the video suggests that state money paid for perry personal travel and that his sole purpose of visiting sin city was to party neither of which is accurate
taxpayers paid a large portion of the cost of the governor s trip to las vegas the security detail that always travels with him
