"On most things except witch trials, Virginia will always have been first."
on most things except witch trials virginia will always have been first griffith told in roanoke on april
but we were able to get to the bottom of griffith s other claim that virginia was not the first colony to hold a witchcraft trial
morgan griffith says virginia did not hold the first colonial witch trial
our ruling massachusetts is well known for its attempts to root out sorcery but evidence shows virginia held the first witchcraft trial in the colonies
although virginia held the first known witchcraft trial in colonies it was not a hotbed of suspicion and water tests
