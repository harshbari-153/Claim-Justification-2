Says drinking cream of tartar mixed with orange juice daily will help people quit smoking because it "flushes the nicotine" out of the body.
a viral facebook post says people can easily quit smoking by mixing cream of tartar and orange juice because it helps remove nicotine from the body
simply mixing cream of tartar powder with orange juice will flush the nicotine out of your system
no evidence that cream of tartar and orange juice will help you quit smoking
there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that drinking cream of tartar and orange juice rids the body of nicotine and thus helps people quit smoking
i know this sounds too simple but it really works the cream of tartar flushes the nicotine out of your system and blocks it from receiving it again after about two days smoking tastes like s you blocked from the nicotine rush and the desire is gone
