Says House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump "doesn’t feature the opposition party, it doesn’t feature cross-examination."
limbaugh said house democrats impeachment inquiry doesn t feature the opposition party it doesn t feature
conservative radio host rush limbaugh wrongly claimed that house democrats leading the impeachment inquiry of president donald trump are keeping republicans out of their hearings
republicans on the house intelligence oversight and foreign affairs committees in total have been able to participate in hearings organized as part of the impeachment inquiry
but he is wrong that the hearings have excluded house republicans of whom sit on the three committees that have been leading the investigation
in three previous impeachments the full house authorized inquiries and the house judiciary committee took the lead in conducting investigations holding hearings and voting on whether to approve articles of impeachment
