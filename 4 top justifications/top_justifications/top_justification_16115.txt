"So now if you don’t comply" and get a COVID-19 vaccination, and you’re on "Social Security or disability, you won’t be able to receive your money."
a headline widely shared on social media stated so now if you don t comply and get a vaccination and you re on social security or disability you won t be able to receive your money
so now if you don t comply and on social security or disability you won t be able to receive your money
but if you on social security or your parent is receiving social security checks this is what my colleague is suggesting by blocking this legislation get the vaccine or go broke
a headline widely shared on social media falsely suggests that if you don t get a vaccine you ll lose your social security benefits
no vaccination required to receive social security payments
