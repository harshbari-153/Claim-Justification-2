Says "6 percent more Republicans across the state voted than Democrats."
six percent more republicans across the state voted than democrats
if you take that into account the numbers show that percent of all republicans had turned out to vote while
while more democrats than republicans voted there are far more oregon voters registered as democrats than as republicans
that means democrats accounted for about percent of returned ballots and republicans for about percent
if you take the statement at face value it sounds as though you had more republicans than democrats voting
