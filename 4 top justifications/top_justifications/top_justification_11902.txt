Itâ€™s warmer on Mars than it is in parts of the United States and Canada during the polar vortex.
we ve seen a lot of tweets about how it s colder in the united states and canada than it is on mars due to the frigid weather system known as the polar vortex
the air on mars is much colder than its surface
so the coldest places in the united states and canada can edge out the warmest places on mars especially if we look at mars ground temperature not air temperature
so we touched base with scientists to see whether the united states and canada really have been colder than mars
but on average there s no question that mars is colder
