Says taxpayer resources are being used "to facilitate private political agendas" through automatic payroll deduction of union dues.
in the middle of a complex policy discussion this seemed like an important fact to pin down what do governments spend on collecting union dues through payroll deductions we caught up with thrasher on the senate floor to ask him if he had more information about the costs to government
what does it cost governments for automatic payroll deductions
the law would prohibit public unions from utilizing payroll deductions and would require unions to get annual authorizations from members to use their dues for political reasons
he said he did not but that there had to be some cost just by the nature of the government performing a task payroll deduction on behalf of a private entity
state statutes also permit governments to ask unions to pay for deduction costs as part of collective bargaining
