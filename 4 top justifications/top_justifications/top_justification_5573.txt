"[Renewable energy] projects . . . get us off foreign oil and away, step by step, from these foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply."
our ruling whitehouse said on the senate floor that renewable energy projects would get us off foreign oil and away from foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply
those projects created jobs they put people to work they lowered the cost for these banks of their electrical energy and they get us off foreign oil and away step by step from these foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply
but a layperson would assume something different from the senator s statement that oil is a large part of our generating supply and that alternative energy projects would substantially reduce oil consumption
sheldon whitehouse says development of renewable energy will get us off foreign oil
after asking for an explanation of whitehouse s comments his office did point out one way that renewable energy would lessen oil usage
