"The single-largest expense in Â over half of American households is child care."
according to video of the event trump said the single largest expense in over half of american households is child care
trump said that child care is the single largest expense faced by half of american families
correction this report originally misquoted trump s comments based on reporting at the event as saying the single largest expense in american households is child care
the single largest expense in over half of american households is childcare even exceeding the cost of housing trump said april
the question is does paying for child care top all the other expenses that half of the households have to cover such as housing and food
