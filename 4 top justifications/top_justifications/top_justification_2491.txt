Says Gavin Newsom "didn’t solve the homeless problem at all" as mayor of San Francisco, "and it’s gotten worse."
republican john cox claimed gavin newsom didn t solve the homeless problem in san francisco at all adding it s gotten worse
we also noted that newsom s statement does not reflect the slight increase in san francisco s overall homeless population during his time as mayor
a san francisco chronicle article said newsom had moved more homeless people into supportive housing in his seven years in office than any other mayor in the city history and has one of the best track records of any mayor in the country on that score
that s higher than newsom s final month as mayor and generally supports the last portion of cox s statement that the problem has gotten worse
