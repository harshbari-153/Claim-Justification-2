Says sheâ€™s "tried over 100 jury cases in Travis County courts."
you are correct that some of our campaign literature mistakenly says that i have tried over jury trials in travis county she said
that brings us to travis county jury trials short of her mailer claim to over jury trials
it states that montford has tried over jury cases in travis county courts
update judicial candidate mindy montford says in mailer plus a door hanger that she had over jury trials in travis county
montford running for judge of the state district court says on her campaign web site that she s had over trials and handled thousands of cases a claim that seems possible considering she worked nearly a decade as a prosecutor
