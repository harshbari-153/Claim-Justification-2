The Trans-Pacific Partnership "was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone."
trump said the trans pacific partnership was designed for china to come in as they always do through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone
it a deal that was designed for china to come in as they always do through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone
trump says china gets an advantage from the partnership
they are going to come in later through the backdoor and they will take advantage of what all of these other people were negotiating and the wall street journal does a big editorial that i did know about china
it would definitely be good for the chinese once they are able to join but frankly that would also be good for the united states
