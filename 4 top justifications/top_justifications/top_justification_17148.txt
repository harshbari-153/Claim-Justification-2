Haitian migrants took an implausible route to Texas-Mexico border area.
a facebook post suggests that haitian migrants took an implausible route across the gulf of mexico to arrive at the border
customs and border protection encountered haitian migrants crossing the border illegally almost times along the southwest border of those encounters took place in texas
why haitians are crossing into the in texas and not somewhere closer
the haitians who are arriving in texas did not take a direct route from haiti
am i the only one that wonders how haitians traveled miles to end up under a bridge in del rio texas stated one facebook post showing a straight red line from haiti across the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico to texas
