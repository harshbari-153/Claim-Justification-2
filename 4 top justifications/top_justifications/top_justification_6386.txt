o rourke said he didn t try to leave the scene of his dwi accident and arrest
o rourke replied at the southern methodist university debate i did not try to leave the scene of the accident though driving drunk which i did is a terrible mistake for which there is no excuse or justification or defense and i will not try to provide one
but not this question as the houston chronicle pointed out recently a witness said in that accident that you tried to leave the scene of the accident
evans noted that the police report shows he was arrested for a dwi not for leaving or attempting to leave the scene
but the witness turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to get the defendant to stop
