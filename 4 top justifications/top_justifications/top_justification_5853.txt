Ending federal funding for National Public Radio would jeopardize 9,000 jobs.
jim moran says ending federal funding of npr would jeopardize jobs
which would strip npr of federal funding and set certain rules on how public radio stations nationwide could spend federal money would put jobs at risk
it would remove million in direct federal funding from npr
so losing the million would have cost npr
eliminating funding for npr would do little to rein in our national debt
