"I have 35 years' experience making change."
i have years experience making change she said in a tv ad in december and has repeated the phrase or variations of it many times since
her claim to be an agent of change for that time is a flourish of campaign rhetoric she was trying to match obama claim to the word change but we find it reasonable because to be an advocate for any group or cause often means to seek change
there are a few periods during her arkansas years when she had less time for public service because she was busy with corporate law and her duties as a new mother
hillary clinton often boasts that she has a long resume years long to be precise
and so we find clinton resume and accomplishments generally support her claims of years of political experience
