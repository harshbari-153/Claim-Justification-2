McCain "voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban."
his reputation is built on his opposition to torture but mccain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding and then applauded president bush for vetoing that ban the states
moveon claiming that mccain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding refers to a measure passed in february that would have forced the cia to follow the army field manual which specifically forbids waterboarding as well as other actions forcing a detainee to perform sexual acts or pose sexually placing hoods over the heads of detainees threatening detainees with dogs or using temperature extremes to cause physical trauma among other things
moveon statement that the bill mccain opposed bans waterboarding is a problematic summation
it true that mccain voted against the measure it passed anyway and bush vetoed it
mccain has also been persistent in arguing that waterboarding an interrogation technique that simulates drowning is torture
