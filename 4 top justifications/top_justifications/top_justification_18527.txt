SaysÂ the State Department has "had half a year" to respond to a Benghazi document request, yet "I have not gotten a single, solitary scrap of paper."
gowdy said the state department has had half a year to respond to a benghazi document request yet i have not gotten a single solitary scrap of paper
but it s inaccurate to say they haven t received a single solitary scrap of paper related to their november request
they have had half a year and i have not gotten a single solitary scrap of paper
gowdy has a point that he s still waiting on quite a few documents but it goes too far to say he hasn t received a single solitary scrap of paper
there s no denying that the benghazi committee doesn t have all the documents it wants and not by the committee s desired timeline
