Obama "basically threatened to bomb Pakistan."
barack obama basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i do think was a particularly wise position to take
but it is a significant distortion to say obama wants to attack pakistan as president bush did and an even more serious one that he supports bombing pakistan as mccain and clinton did
that obama suggested bombing pakistan and bush who said in a feb
the transcript of his speech makes it clear that obama is talking about targeting terrorists within the country regardless of whether he has the permission of the pakistani government
he spoke about the problem of terrorists at large within pakistan
