would milwaukee maximum forfeiture for marijuana be lower than for bicycle violations
puente said if milwaukee approves reducing its maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession to the city would have different bicycle violations that have a higher forfeiture
if the council approves reducing the maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession would it be lower than the forfeiture for bicycle violations
nine of the violations carry a maximum forfeiture of much higher than the maximum for marijuana should the marijuana ordinance be changed
setting a maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession that is lower than that for many other violations that are arguably less serious would send the wrong message to our community
