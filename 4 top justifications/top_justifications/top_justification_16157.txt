Ivanka Trumpâ€™s shoe line is made in China but is exempt from tariffs.
an image posted on facebook claims to show a box of ivanka trump brand shoes made in china with a tariff exempt stamp
photo of ivanka trump s fashion line being tariff exempt was manipulated
but a photo circulating on facebook falsely claims that ivanka s brand lives on and is exempt from the tariffs her father president donald trump has imposed on china
the photo appears to show a box of ivanka trump brand shoes with the label made in china and a stamp that says tarriff exempt
while her father s latest round of tariffs on chinese goods largely targets electronics ivanka trump s brand likely would be affected if it were still in operation because the items to be taxed also include many types of footwear
