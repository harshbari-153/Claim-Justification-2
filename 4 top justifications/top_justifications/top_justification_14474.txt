pittenger said the spending bill does not designate a single dollar for planned parenthood
while the omnibus bill gives no new funding to planned parenthood and doesn t designate money for the organization by name it does allow planned parenthood to continue receiving money from the federal government
one of the bill s positives pittenger said in a recent newsletter is that the bill does not designate a single dollar for planned parenthood
so the omnibus bill doesn t end funding for planned parenthood even if the health organization isn t specifically mentioned as a funding recipient
the bill doesn t specifically direct funding to planned parenthood by name
