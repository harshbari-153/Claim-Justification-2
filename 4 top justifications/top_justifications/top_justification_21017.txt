If President Barack Obama strikes a nuclear deal with Iran, "the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time."
the letter written by cotton said that if obama strikes a nuclear deal with iran the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time
the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time
we found broad agreement among experts that a future president or a future congress could indeed undo or modify the kind of agreement that s currently being negotiated with iran but the senators letter makes the process sound more clear cut and easier than it actually is
the obama administration s efforts to negotiate a nuclear deal with iran were already contentious
retreating from one executive agreement would be a pretty radical step historically and could endanger the nation ability to both ensure that old agreements stand and to strike new agreements
