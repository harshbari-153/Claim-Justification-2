"As the Democrats finally maxed out their government spending credit card Monday, Kurt Schrader continued to stand with his party leaders in failing to offer any viable long-term solution."
in an attack used in some variation against schrader and other house democrats the nrcc also claimed that schrader and his fellow democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out
kurt schrader and his fellow democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out the press release said
is kurt schrader at fault for maxing out government card
but is it the fault of schrader and house democrats that the federal credit card has been maxed out not exactly
the case is even more difficult to make against schrader since he is actively involved with the fiscally conservative blue dog democrats whose sole purpose in life is to restrain federal spending
