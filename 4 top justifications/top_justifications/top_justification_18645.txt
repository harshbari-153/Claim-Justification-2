epstein s recruiter ghislaine maxwell s father robert maxwell gave mitt romney his first investment and started him in business
a facebook post claims that robert maxwell the father of the woman who allegedly recruited girls and young women for sexual exploitation by jeffrey epstein gave mitt romney his first million investment and got him started in business
but romney had already established himself in business by the time robert maxwell gave him money and maxwell s investment was not the first in the fund
moreover romney s first fund at the firm was seeded by million from bain partners although maxwell was one of the early outside investors
the million from maxwell did not start romney in business
