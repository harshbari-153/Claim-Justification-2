President Ronald Reagan sent troops into conflict "only in one circumstance, which was in Grenada â€¦ We were in a peacekeeping setting in Lebanon."
romney said reagan sent troops into conflict only once
soldiers go into a conflict setting just once and does calling lebanon a peacekeeping setting mean that conflict was any less of a threat we asked the romney campaign about this but did hear back
only in one circumstance which was in grenada did our forces go in a conflict setting
stayed out of conflict settings under reagan except once in grenada
we were in a peacekeeping setting in lebanon
