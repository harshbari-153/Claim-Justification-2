Pepsi admitted an employee contaminated its products with AIDS.
a worker from the company has admitted that he added his blood contaminated with aids
no a pepsi employee did contaminate the company products
this is false pepsico said in an email after politifact wrote seeking more information about the claim
but for what it s worth you can t get hiv from consuming food handled by someone with hiv according to the centers for disease control and prevention
for the next few weeks please do not drink any product from pepsi like pepsi tropicana juice slice etc
