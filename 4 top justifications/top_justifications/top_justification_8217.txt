A New York imam wants toÂ "have a mosque at Ground Zero.''
is the ground zero mosque at ground zero
while we considering the term ground zero mosque we also wondered whether it was proper to call the project a mosque
president ground zero is the wrong place for a mosque
in all of the debate over the ground zero mosque we thought it made sense to start with the most basic whether it was accurate to even call it the ground zero mosque or a mosque at or on ground zero
this imam at face value who says that this is about healing divisions why would you want to have a mosque at ground zero when you know it opening the wounds of the families of the victims of that are still feeling this pain as if it was yesterday
