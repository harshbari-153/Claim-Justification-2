Says Russ Feingold said that with Obamacare, "we could keep our doctors and our plans, it was rated as the Lie of the Year."
chamber says feingold said that with obamacare we could keep our doctors and our plans it was rated as the lie of the year
so the chamber s claim is that feingold said we could keep our doctors and plans under obamacare
did wisconsin senate candidate russ feingold repeat the lie of the year about obamacare
but we also found this statement about obamacare on feingold s campaign website
the reference is to politifact national s lie of the year for which was this statement made repeatedly by obama and others about the affordable care act if you like your health care plan you can keep it
