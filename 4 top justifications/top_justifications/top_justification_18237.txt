For vaccine rates among Americans 65 and older, "thereâ€™s virtually no difference between white, Black, Hispanic, Asian American."
as such we are not able to assess whether there are racial disparities in vaccinations among people over years of age
in several states vaccine administration rates are more proportional to the percentage of the black and hispanic populations but the data covers all age groups
some states are vaccinating similar percentages of their population of black or hispanic people matthew said however that data does not distinguish by age group
national data for all age groups also shows that rates of vaccinations for black and hispanic people lag behind that of white people
for the few states that do report data on age and combined the numbers suggest that for the most part obvious disparities persist in the vaccination rates for white seniors and seniors of color
