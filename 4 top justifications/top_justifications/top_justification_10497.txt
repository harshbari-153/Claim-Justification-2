Since Sherrod Brown and the Democrats "rammed" the economic stimulus bill through, "Ohio's unemployment rate has risen to 9.6 percent, above the national average."
but since brown and the democrats rammed the bill into law on a vote ohio unemployment rate has risen to
and it suggests that ohio s unemployment rate has risen above the national average since the stimulus bill passed
so we go back to the nrsc claim that since brown and democrats rammed the bill into law on a vote ohio s unemployment rate has risen to
that s ohio s latest unemployment rate
that difference explains why ohio s unemployment rate which was even with the nation not long ago is above the national rate again
