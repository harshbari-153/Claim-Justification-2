Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on supporting "the president's Recovery Act."
but it s misleading to say romney on supporting the president recovery act
our ruling in the cnn interview romney expressed support broadly for economic stimulus not for a specific measure known as the president recovery act
here s the relevant portion from the dnc ad text opposed the stimulus video clip of romney i have never supported the president recovery act alright the stimulus
given that romney outlined a whole list of conditions he d impose on such a bill we think it s unfair for the dnc to say romney once supported the president recovery act
what do you think about this proposal romney replied well i frankly wish that the last congress had dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president could have signed that before leaving office
