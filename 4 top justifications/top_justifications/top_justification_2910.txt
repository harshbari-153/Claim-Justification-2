"Undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born."
villaraigosa said undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born
mostly true undocumented immigrants less likely to commit crimes than citizens
it found immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates
the study s findings provide additional evidence backing up villaraigosa s claim that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native born
but going after the undocumented is not a crime strategy when you look at the fact that the national academy of sciences in i think it was november of the undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born
