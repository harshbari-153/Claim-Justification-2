"The Legislative Ethics Commission continues to function."
madigan said the illinois legislative ethics commission continued to function for nearly three years while the office of legislative inspector general was vacant
it s regrettable that we have not had an inspector general but i think it s important to know that the legislative ethics commission continues to function madigan said
as described on the legislative ethics commission s website and in illinois statutes the duties of the commission rely heavily on the presence of a legislative inspector general
to the extent that the commission continued to schedule monthly meetings and saw to internal matters it did continue to function
how could the ethics commission continue to function in any meaningful way if there was no one to investigate complaints of ethical violations brought to it isn t the primary purpose of any ethics commission to investigate and mete out discipline for ethics violations and if it was functioning why did rotheimer s case languish until she went public with her allegations
