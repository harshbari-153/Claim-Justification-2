The Republican Party has "21 percent party ID and shrinking."
republican party identification is shrinking
but one checkable fact stood out to us percent party id and shrinking meaning that the gop now has only percent of the electorate and that figure is declining
gallup has recorded a decline in republican party identification from about percent in to percent in
so the dnc is right that the number of voters identifying themselves as republicans has been declining
the next question is whether republican registrations are declining
