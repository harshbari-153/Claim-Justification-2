social media users wrong to suggest megan thee stallion wasn t shot
on may multiple facebook users shared the same image post that suggests megan thee stallion was not shot but had stepped on glass
in july megan attended a party with lanez and later that night megan was shot
a more detailed medical report from the day megan was shot shows that there are bullet fragments in her foot
