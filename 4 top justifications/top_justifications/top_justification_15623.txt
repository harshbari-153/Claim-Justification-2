Says Democratic members of Congress who represent Cuban Americans in Florida and have been critical of Sanders "just so happen to be supporting other candidates."
sanders said democratic members of congress who represent cuban americans in florida just so happen to be supporting other candidates
bernie sanders comments about florida democrats who represent cuban americans
by the way all of those congresspeople that you mentioned just so happen to be supporting other candidates just accidentally no doubt coincidentally sanders said
on top of criticizing sanders on cuba they have publicly cast doubt on whether they would support him as the democratic nominee
as the first south american immigrant member of congress who proudly represents thousands of cuban americans i find senator bernie sanders comments on castro s cuba absolutely unacceptable
