"The Democrats in the Senate and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change."
meanwhile mccain said the democrats in the senate and some and some members of congress defended what fannie and freddie were doing
mccain rightly notes that the efforts to regulate fannie and freddie were and opposed by the democrats but mccain current attempts to depict those efforts as an early warning that could have lessened the current credit crisis do wash
so for mccain to lay fannie and freddie woes entirely at the feet of the democrats is unfair
when mccain points an accusing finger at the democrats for encouraging fannie and freddie to make too many risky loans he talking about the federal housing enterprise regulatory reform act initiated by republican sen
while mccain is quick to blame democrats for opposing the legislation they did the republicans controlled congress at the time and there was a republican in the white house
