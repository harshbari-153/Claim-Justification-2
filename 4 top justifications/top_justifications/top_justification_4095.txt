Says NASA spent more than $165 million over 10 years to develop a pen that "writes in zero gravity, upside down" and in extreme temperatures while the "Russians used a pencil instead."
a online myth mocks how much time and money nasa and congress allegedly spent to develop a space pen that can write in zero gravity and extreme temperatures because the russians simply used a pencil
an old myth that nasa and congress spent over million to develop the space pen while the russians simply used pencils has recently resurfaced on the internet
no nasa did not spend over million on a space pen while russians used pencils
to combat this problem congress approved a program and nasa scientists spent a decade and over million developing a pen that writes in zero gravity upside down on almost any surface and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over celsius
the post reads when nasa started sending astronauts into space they quickly discovered that ballpoint pens would not work in zero gravity
