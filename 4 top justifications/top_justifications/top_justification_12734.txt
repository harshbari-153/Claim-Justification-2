Health care reform plans being consided in Congress "will finally reduce the costs of health care."
obama said health care reform will reduce the cost of health care
we agree on reforms that will finally reduce the costs of health care obama said
said the report shows that health reform will ensure both the federal government and the american people spend less on health care than if this bill does pass helping get a hold of america debt and keep more money in people pockets
so when obama says reforms will lower the cost of health care what he means is that they will eventually slow the rate of growth of health care expenses
and because it gets rid of the waste and inefficiencies in our health care system this will be the largest deficit reduction plan in over a decade
