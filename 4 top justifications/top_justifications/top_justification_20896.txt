"Climate change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that attempt to tell us what's going to happen in 50 years or 30. Notice the predictions are never for next year or the next 10 years. They're always for way, way, way, way out there, when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true."

limbaugh said climate predictions are always pegged to some distant future when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true
second climate change predictions from decades past have largely been borne out
however many climate models begin their simulations around and can project forward through the present day and up to the year
