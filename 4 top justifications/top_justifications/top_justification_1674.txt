"The deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office."
as a result the deficit was on track to top trillion the year i took office
but since many republicans are blaming the problem on reckless spending by obama we decided to check his claim that the deficit was on track to top trillion the year i took office
obama says the deficit was on track to top trillion the year he took office
again this was the deficit projection for before obama took office
rather baker wrote it was the recession and the response to it that pushed the deficit in from the billion projected by cbo to the over trillion noted by president obama in his speech
