Alex Sink was "the first official who said that BP should pay $25 million for an ad campaign to promote Florida tourism."
she was also the first official who said that bp should pay million for an ad campaign to promote florida tourism
we wondered if sink really was the first official to say bp should fund a campaign to promote florida
the article stated it was sink on may who first demanded that the oil giant bp pay for a tv ad blitz aimed at shoring up florida tourism
so sink was the first statewide elected official to demand tourism ad money from bp
sink campaign did not provide any documentation that she specifically asked for million either but we think the more interesting point is whether she was the first official to say bp should give the state money for a tourism ad campaign
