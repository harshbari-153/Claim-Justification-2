"Church services can’t resume until we’re all vaccinated, says Bill Gates."
the headline of an april blog post on the website pulpit pen says church services can t resume until we re all vaccinated says bill gates
what he doesn t say that church services can t resume until we re all vaccinated
but gates doesn t specify that this means church gatherings nor does he have any power to forbid church services until we re all vaccinated as the post says
the blog goes on to say that gates now argues that mass gatherings churches will not meet again until a vaccine is found and everyone is vaccinated
no bill gates didn t say no church services until everyone is vaccinated
