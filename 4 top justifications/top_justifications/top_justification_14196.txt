a facebook post claimed that police budget cuts are to blame for skyrocketing murder rates in philadelphia minneapolis portland new york city chicago los angeles and washington d
cities and suggests that s a result of cities defunding police departments
in several cities across the nation including the ones mentioned in the facebook post reduced or redistributed police funding for fiscal year as they grappled with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic plus activists calls to defund the police
most importantly the claim implies that there is a direct link between defunding and homicide rates that has not yet been established
the statement contains an element of truth homicides are up in these cities and police funding is down
