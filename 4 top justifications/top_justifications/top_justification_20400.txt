An ongoing audit of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona "showed Trump ahead by 250,000" votes, and "nearly 950,000 ballots are declared illegal, nearly all for Biden."
a widely shared social media post claimed that an ongoing audit of the presidential election in arizona showed trump ahead by votes and nearly ballots are declared illegal nearly all for biden
no truth to the claim that arizona audit found trump up by votes
so the instagram claim would have you believe that the audit found roughly of biden s votes were illegal
and posts on social media falsely suggest that the audit showed trump was overtaking biden
there is no evidence that the audit has turned up any illegal ballots or changes in votes that would give trump the lead in arizona
