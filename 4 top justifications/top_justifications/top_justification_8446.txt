President Obamaâ€™s health care law "represents a government takeover of health care."
romney calls obama health care law a government takeover
such is the case with the claim by many republicans that the new health care law is a government takeover of health care
when we asked romney s camp to explain their use of the term government takeover spokesman eric fehrnstrom said it seems pretty obvious that under obamacare the federal government takes on a vastly expanded role in health care
he made the same point in an accompanying powerpoint slide which called obamacare a government takeover of health care as opposed to which he said was designed to help people get and keep their health insurance
government takeover conjures a european approach in which the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees
