The "federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls."
cruz said the federal government is going after school districts trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls
look cruz said these guys are so nutty that the federal government is going after school districts trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls
the texan went on now listen i m the father of two daughters and the idea that the federal government is coming in saying that boys with all the equipment of boys can be in the shower room with junior high girls this is lunacy
and i bet you there are a whole lot of parents particularly parents of daughters that are not eager to have the federal government saying guess what your daughter has to shower with a boy if he wants to be in there cruz said
ted cruz incorrectly says government trying to force boys and girls to shower together
