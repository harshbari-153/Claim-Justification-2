"We have cut crime across every single zone in the city of Atlanta by between 10 percent and 16 percent, depending on the zone."
we have cut crime across every single zone in the city of atlanta by between percent and percent depending on the zone reed announced
and in the case of east atlanta where crime dropped percent the decline is far more dramatic than the percent to percent decrease reed mentioned in his state of the city address
we clicked through it and found that while crime is down percent across the city it s not down in all of the city s six zones
this is what we found zone crime declined percent in this west atlanta zone
crime is down in atlanta but reed mangled the specifics
