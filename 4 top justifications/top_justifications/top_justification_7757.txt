If the government shuts down, "all military personnel will continue to serve and accrue pay but will not actually be paid until appropriations are available."
all military personnel will continue to serve and accrue pay but will not actually be paid until appropriations are available he said
in april before congress narrowly avoided a government shutdown the department announced that the military would continue to work but would be paid retroactively
young s claim is that the military can not be paid without appropriations is correct
in november the shutdown lasted five days which was not long enough to affect military pay
that means the military would delay paychecks
