under our current sentencing laws about percent of all convicted felons in oregon do not go to prison
as for our ruling the das were very specific in their statement that percent of all convicted felons in oregon do not go to prison
for starters that percent figure doesn t include the percent of felons who serve state time but do it in local jails
there s one last bit to consider about percent of all convicted felons wind up with probation
put another way only percent of convicted felons actually manage to avoid time behind bars as part of their sentence
