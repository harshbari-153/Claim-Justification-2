Says the United States does not "trade as much as other developed nations."
measured in absolute terms few countries can match the united states when it comes to products shipped abroad according to the world trade organization and the cia world factbook both of which put united states exports of merchandise the broadest category behind only germany and china
here s how some other nations compare with the u
that s because if the united states accepts more trade agreements in order to expand exports it is likely to result in more foreign goods coming into the united states too
