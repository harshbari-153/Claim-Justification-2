"All legislative mail, from the content to the timing, is approved by the speaker's office."
all legislative mail from the content to the timing is approved by the speaker s office therefore if they have an argument they have to take it up with speaker ron ramsey who the last time i looked was a republican kyle said in the article
all legislative mail approved by senate speaker says state democratic leader
but by going on to declare that all legislative mail requires approval of the speaker kyle erred
a second class of mail however may be subject to approval by the senate speaker in the case of senators or the house speaker in the case of representatives
first there is what might be called regular mail the daily flow of letters postcards and the like to and from legislators their constituents other government officials and various parties interested in legislation
