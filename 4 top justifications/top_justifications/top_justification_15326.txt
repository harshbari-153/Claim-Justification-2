Legal prescription drugs "statistically kill 100,000 people a year, (but) there are no documented deaths due to marijuana."
and that marijuana products deal or compete directly with legal prescription drugs that statistically kill people a year and there are no documented deaths due to marijuana
johnson said that marijuana competes with legal prescription drugs that statistically kill people a year and there are no documented deaths due to marijuana
is it true that marijuana has caused any deaths while prescription drugs have caused
but johnson said that prescription drugs statistically kill people every year
in summary it appears that marijuana doesn t directly cause overdose deaths but there are documented cases where it likely led to accidental fatalities
