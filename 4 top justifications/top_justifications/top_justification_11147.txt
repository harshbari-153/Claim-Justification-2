At a 2015 dedication of an FBI building in Florida, Rep. Frederica Wilson "stood up there ... and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money -- the $20 million -- to build the building. And she sat down."
and a congresswoman stood up and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money and she just called up president obama and on that phone call he gave the money the million to build the building
and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money and she just called up president obama and on that phone call he gave the money the million to build the building
however in her speech wilson didn t mention funding for the building much less claim credit for it or tell the audience how she leveraged influence with obama to secure it
wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain fbi agents about her own actions in congress including lobbying former president obama on legislation
wilson did describe how she helped secure legislation to name the building for two slain agents but kelly s description leaves out that the fbi pressed her to make that effort and that she shared credit with several other lawmakers including the republican house speaker and florida s republican senator
