Discretionary spending has "increased over 20-some percent in two years if you don’t include the stimulus. If you put in the stimulus, it’s over 80 percent."
that suggests that when you add in the stimulus discretionary spending increased percent during the first two years of the obama administration not over percent as cantor says
let s review cantor said discretionary spending has increased over percent in two years if you don t include the stimulus
it would mean discretionary spending if you include the stimulus increased percent during the first two years of the obama administration far shy of the over percent cantor claimed
without the stimulus discretionary spending increased
if you put the stimulus in it s over percent
