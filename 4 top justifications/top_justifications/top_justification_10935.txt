Currently, the intelligence community "can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism."
so we wondered whether the law allows the intelligence community to legally collect business records on americans who have no connection to terrorism
udall said that currently the intelligence community can collect business records on americans who have no connection to terrorism
instead he warned broadly that the intelligence community can collect business records on americans who have no connection to terrorism
meanwhile common sense tells us that millions of americans who are having their metadata collected are not involved in terrorism further bolstering udall s claim
information on millions of americans was accessed almost all of whom had no connection to terrorism
