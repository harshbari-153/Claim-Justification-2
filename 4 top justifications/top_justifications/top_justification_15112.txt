The 2006 Massachusetts health care law has "added (only) about 1 percent to our state budget."
deval patrick said the massachusetts health care law added percent to the state budget
patrick said his state s health care law added about percent to our state budget and an independent analysis confirms that
massachusetts overhauled its health care laws in to work toward universal coverage
many consider it a model for national health care reform even critics who say that massachusetts problems with cost controls mean the national plan will have similar problems
actually it added about percent to our state budget which is not what is generally reported on out there but that is the truth patrick said
