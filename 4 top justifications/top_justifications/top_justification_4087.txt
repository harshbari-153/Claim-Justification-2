Says he "helped save" the Olympic games.
so did romney really help save the olympic games that a broad claim
and i left that to go off and help save the olympic games
our ruling while it may be stretch to suggest the future of olympics themselves were at stake during romney s time in salt lake by all accounts he did help the city s moribund olympic committee reverse its fortunes after an embarrassing scandal and brought the winter olympics to a successful conclusion
was he successful at not just fixing the salt lake olympics but also saving the olympic tradition romney left bain in early to take over leadership of the games in the aftermath of a bribery scandal that ultimately exposed years of widespread corruption by members of the international olympic committee and their counterparts in host cities during the bidding process used to award the games
he said the romney improved the situation in salt lake but that the claim in the romney ad that he helped save the olympics is too broad
