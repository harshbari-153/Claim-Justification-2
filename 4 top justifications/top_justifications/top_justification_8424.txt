the majority of citizens in the country will have no change at all because most of the population resides in states that have already protected abortion rights turley said june the day of the decision
turley said the majority of citizens in the country will have no change at all because most of the population resides in states that have already protected abortion rights
we found that of the population lives in states that have already protected abortion rights in the sense that they affirmatively passed laws to keep abortion legal in roe s absence
ultimately whether a majority of americans end up living in states with or without legal abortion will depend on how these states divide on this issue
this leaves of the population a majority living in a state where for now at least the overturning of roe isn t changing the legal status of abortion
