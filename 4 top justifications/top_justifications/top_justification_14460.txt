Says "Abortion clinics in Oregon, as in most states, have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards."
part of the problem here she writes is that abortion clinics in oregon as in most states have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards
we re looking into the factual basis of atteberry s statement that abortion clinics in oregon have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards
are abortion clinics in oregon not held to health or safety standards
do abortion clinics in oregon really face no state oversight is it true that they don t have to meet basic health and safety standards in an interview atteberry said that ambulatory surgical clinics such as ones for eye or shoulder surgery are subject to state oversight but that abortion clinics are exempted specifically from abiding by these restrictions and safety guidelines
some abortion clinics are not licensed in the way other outpatient medical offices are regulated
