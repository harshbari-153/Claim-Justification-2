A study says Massachusetts has lost 18,000 jobs because residents were required to obtain health insurance under an act signed into law by Mitt Romney.
rick perry says a study found that massachusetts lost jobs because of a mandate in its health care law
perry continued the beacon hill study itself said that there s been jobs lost because of that individual mandate
both statements suggest that actual jobs were eliminated because of the massachusetts law
in addition to including an individual mandate the massachusetts and federal laws both leave in place the existing insurance systems insurance medicare for seniors and medicaid for the poor
the study is based on the idea that the massachusetts law drove up health care costs for state government through increased medicaid spending and for individuals and businesses through higher health insurance premiums which in turn dampened job growth
