"Did Obama know that Tony Rezko was saving him $300,000 on the purchase of his home?"
one of those questions did obama know that tony rezko was saving him on the purchase of his home
by asking if obama knew about it the question presumes the claim is true that rezko did in fact save obama on the purchase of his home
no proof rezko saved obama money on home
but that still a long way from saying the rezkos saved the obamas
having the rezkos as flexible buyers on the vacant lot might have helped the obamas get the house they had been trying to buy but there just nothing to support the gop claim that the rezkos saved the obamas
