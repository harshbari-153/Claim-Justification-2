Says Hillary Clinton called Barack Obama "naive" for saying he was would "sit down and talk to the Iranians" during the 2008 Democratic primary.
sanders said that clinton called obama naive for saying he was would sit down and talk to the iranians during the democratic primary
a question was asked to obama that said would you sit down and talk to the iranians and he said yeah i would
at one point clinton did call obama s position on iran diplomacy naive but sanders is leaving out important nuance that misrepresents her position at the time
secretary clinton i think called him naive
it was obama s approach to diplomacy with iran that she called naive not the idea of pursuing diplomatic relations in general
