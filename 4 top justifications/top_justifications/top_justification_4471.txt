Says Abraham Lincoln said, "America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we lose our freedoms it will be because we have destroyed ourselves from within."
lincoln knew best the july post says before attributing this statement to the former president america will never be destroyed from the outside
if we lose our freedoms it will be because we have destroyed ourselves from within
as a recent facebook post wonders whether radical democrats are destroying america it leans on what would seem to be a prescient quote from abraham lincoln
this abraham lincoln quote is fake but it s close to something he actually said
christian mcwhirter a lincoln historian at the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum told politifact it is not accurate in that lincoln never spoke or wrote it but it is not totally fabricated either
