"I am the only (state attorney general) in America fighting to hold the big tech companies accountable for their behavior."
i am the only attorney general in america fighting to hold the big tech companies accountable for their behavior he said in a primary victory speech on aug
hawley said i am the only state attorney general in america fighting to hold the big tech companies accountable for their behavior
however we found a few other examples of current state attorneys general going that far against tech giants or even further by filing lawsuits
so is hawley really alone among state attorneys general in holding tech companies accountable the record shows that while hawley has been notably active on tech issues he is far from alone among attorneys general
his actions against google and facebook do have a particularly broad focus but he is not alone in pursuing tech giants other attorneys general have also filed lawsuits against those and other companies during the past two years
