A $5-a-night hotel/motel tax that’s part of the transportation bill will hurt Georgia’s convention business by adding extra costs for large groups coming to the state.
new hotel fee adds costs but not always to guests
and if gov nathan deal signs the measure as expected it also will add a fee on hotel and motel stays starting july
the fee is an increase that will affect business
georgia does not have a statewide hotel tax
the new charge is a flat fee tacked on for every night of a hotel stay
