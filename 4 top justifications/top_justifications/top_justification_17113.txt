"I remember landing under sniper fire."
i remember landing under sniper fire
we landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire
there no doubt flying into bosnia was dangerous back in but the threat of sniper fire is not the same as actual sniper fire and hustling off the tarmac is not the same as running with your head down
interestingly clinton memoir living history depicts an arrival that though dangerous included neither actual sniper fire nor running
but i do recall and did not note any close calls on this trip with sniper fire or any other dangers
