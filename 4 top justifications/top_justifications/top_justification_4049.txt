"Under Lee Fisher Ohio has lost nearly 400,000 jobs."
under lee fisher ohio has lost nearly jobs is the key line in portman ad
still at a time when ohio lost thousands of jobs fisher was in charge of the state agency most responsible for bringing new jobs to ohio
bls data shows that during his tenure ohio had a net loss of about jobs a significant number of jobs although not as many as the portman ad states
this claim phrased the job loss as happening under lee fisher which we think is more neutral language that conveys the idea that it occurred while he was the director of the agency
rob portman raps lee fisher for ohio job losses while he was the state development director
