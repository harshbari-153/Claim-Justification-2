"I'm not taking any corporate PAC money."
that s why i m not taking any corporate pac money
kathy manning said i m not taking any corporate pac money
manning is technically correct that she hasn t taken any corporate pac money
and then there s the fact that corporate pacs are not funded from corporate revenues at all
just not what most of us would consider corporate pac money
