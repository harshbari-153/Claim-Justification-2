New school testing standards "will consume approximately twenty days of testing for elementary, middle and high school students."
were students going to be tested for a full days
to that last point they pointedly wrote according to information provided recently through parcc and earlier by the florida department of education fldoe the complete parcc assessments will consume approximately twenty days of testing for elementary middle and high school students
this may in turn also increase the number of testing days
the testing windows give schools time to cycle children through the computerized portions of the tests
even under fcat many teachers have observed that testing season takes over school classrooms and computer labs
