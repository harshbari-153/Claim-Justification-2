Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani "was never sentenced to stoning."
but we rule his claim that ashtiani was never sentenced to stoning in the first place is falseiranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad claims woman was never sentenced to stoning
in fact he said on abc this week that sakineh was never actually sentenced to stoning in the first place
but was ahmadinejad correct that the issue of stoning in this case was pure fabrication that ashtiani was never sentenced to stoning ahmadinejad claim is at odds with earlier comments from iranian justice officials who seemed to acknowledge the stoning sentence while announcing in july the penalty had been shelved for now
first what i want to say is that miss mohammadi was never sentenced to stoning ahmadinejad told this week host christiane amanpour in an interviewed aired on sept
