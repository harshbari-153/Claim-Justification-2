Elena Kagan "violated the law of the United States at various points" with her opposition to military recruiters.
but is it true that kagan violated the law of the united states at various points in the process the military recruiting issue long predated kagan tenure at harvard law school
so one could also argue that kagan did comply with what the law required but we think it a stretch for sessions to say kagan violated the law of the united states at various points in the process
so did kagan violate the law when she banned military recruiters from using the office of career services for that one semester first off the law did say universities may not bar military recruiters
sessions says kagan violated law regarding military recruitment at harvard law school
in kagan penned a letter to the law school community expressing her thoughts on the issue i abhor the military discriminatory recruitment policy
