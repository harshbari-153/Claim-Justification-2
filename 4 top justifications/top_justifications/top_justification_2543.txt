"NIKE has stated, ‘We’re a $76 billion dollar company that can afford to let go of all ‘Make America Great Again’ customers."
a recent facebook post recycles an old claim that nike said we re a billion dollar company that can afford to let go of all make america great again customers
and at the end of the day nike again this is an internationally known company
we re a billion dollar company that can afford to let go of all make america great again customers
no nike didn t say it could afford to lose all maga customers
we reached out to nike about the claim and didn t immediately hear back but a spokesperson for the company told the associated press that the quote is fake
