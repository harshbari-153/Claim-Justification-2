Once the U.S. government signs a U.N. treaty on conventional arms, "all U.S. citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments."
once the us government signs these international treaties all us citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments
but it is simply not true that in the words once the us government signs these international treaties all us citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments
and then we will wake up yet another morning and find that the us has signed a treaty that requires us citizens to deliver any firearm they own to the local government collection and destruction center or face imprisonment
we will wake up one morning and find that the united states has signed a treaty that prohibits firearm and ammunition manufacturers from selling to the public
we will wake up another morning and find that the us has signed a treaty that prohibits any transfer of firearm ownership
