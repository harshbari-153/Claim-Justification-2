When he was Milwaukee County executive, "eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year."
walker says that when he was milwaukee county executive eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year
eight years in a row we pushed through budgets that did not increase the tax levy from the previous year
it was actually nine straight years that walker proposed budgets that did not increase the levy the total amount of property taxes collected
in eight of walker s nine years as county executive the levy increased
but to say he pushed through budgets that did not increase the levy is wrong
