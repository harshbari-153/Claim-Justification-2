"Hospitals, doctors, MRIs, surgeries and so forth are more extensively used and far more expensive in this country than they are in many other countries.''
hospitals doctors mris surgeries and so forth are more extensively used and far more expensive in this country than they are in many other countries
hospitals costing more but wrong about them being more extensively used
doctors are paid significantly more than the average doctor in other countries
it fairly well established that the united states spends more on health care than other economically developed countries so high costs do not come as a surprise
to suggest that the overall health care cost of america which by the way is dramatically higher than any other nation in the world is because of the insurance companies is obviously quite silly
