Says a photo shows an old Christmas tradition of women apologizing "to their husbands for all the mistakes they made during the year and beg for forgiveness."
at christmas women used to apologize to their husbands for all the mistakes they made during the year and beg for forgiveness let s not let this beautiful custom get lost
no evidence old christmas tradition had women begging for husbands forgiveness
a search showed that it was widely circulated on various websites in with captions that simply said women begging men with no mention of christmas marital relationships or forgiveness
but there is no credible evidence that supports the claim that women asked for their husbands forgiveness as part of any christmas custom
he called ridiculous the claim that women what women since not all women share the same traditions apologized so abjectly to their husbands who the implication is had nothing to apologize for and said it sounded more like a patriarchal fantasy than anything based in reality
