"To hear Gov. Christie tell it, everything in New Jersey is going just fine. Well I see another New Jersey with 400,000 unemployed. One of the worst jobless rates in the country. Working and middle class families have seen costs soar, from property taxes to college tuition."
buono is right that nearly new jerseyans are out of work but fewer people are unemployed now than when christie became governor
in the ad buono says that new jersey has one of the worst jobless rates in the country but text in the ad also claims the state ranks nationwide in job creation
well i see another new jersey with unemployed
