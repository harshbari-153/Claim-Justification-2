Georgia Public Service Commission member Stan Wise "has received about 95 percent of his campaign money from the utilities he is supposed to be regulating."
the candidate said wise received nearly all of his contributions from the utilities he is supposed to be regulating
over the past years the incumbent candidate has received about percent of his campaign money from the utilities he is supposed to be regulating she wrote
her point appears correct people associated with the utilities are contributing about percent of psc commissioner stan wise s campaign war chest
georgia s campaign finance laws prohibit psc members from accepting contributions from businesses regulated by the agency wise noted
so where does this leave us davidson would get a higher rating on the if she had said that close to percent of wise s contributions came from individuals and attorneys who work for or represent the interests of utilities
