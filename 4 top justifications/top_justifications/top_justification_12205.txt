"Franklin Roosevelt (was) the last president to come to the Congress to ask for permission to engage into war."
was franklin roosevelt really the last president to come to the congress to ask for permission to engage into war the answer is sort of
so where does this leave us rangel is right that roosevelt is the last president strictly speaking to come to the congress to ask for permission to engage into war
so when rangel says that franklin roosevelt was the last president to come to the congress to ask for permission to go to war he has a point
no president since roosevelt has come to seek permission from congress for military action
and ever since franklin roosevelt the last president to come to the congress to ask for permission to engage into war what i really do understand is that when you talk about you use the word put our young people in harm way what a sacrifice
