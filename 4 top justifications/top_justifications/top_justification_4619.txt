Says nobody in higher education believes Gov. Rick Perryâ€™s proposal to "serve up $10,000 college degrees" is possible.
as for the governor s preposterous scheme to serve up college degrees nobody in higher education believes that is even possible andy brown writes
no doubt there s skepticism in higher education about perry s call
andy brown says nobody in higher education believes bachelor degree is possible
regardless it not a realistic option for most higher ed institutions in texas brown said and for perry to imply otherwise is ridiculous
but no one believes a degree is even possible we reached brown who said by that there is probably someone out there who thinks it is possible at most texas institutions so the word credible probably should have been included as a modifier after nobody
