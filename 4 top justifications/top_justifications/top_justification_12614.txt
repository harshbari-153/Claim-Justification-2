"Requiring photo ID would keep about 200,000 Missourians from voting."
while requiring a photo id could be expensive and might affect or inconvenience between and missourians it wouldn t necessarily keep them from voting
kip kendrick recently weighed in on the legislation s potential for disenfranchising voters saying requiring photo id would keep about missourians from voting
no one knows exactly how many missourians would be affected by new photo id requirements but there is consensus that the number who would need new photo ids is in the hundreds of thousands
we decided to dig into the details of the proposed legislation and take a closer look at just how many missouri voters would be affected by photo id requirements
in theory this would reduce the chances that any new id requirements might disenfranchise voters currently lacking photo identification
