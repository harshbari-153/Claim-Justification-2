In the 1970s, "the swine flu broke out . . . under another Democrat, President Jimmy Carter."
i find it interesting that it was back in the that the swine flu broke out then under another democrat president jimmy carter
two swine flu incidents during republican administrations
michele bachmann wrong that swine flu broke out under carter
so we were exactly surprised when we heard her suggest a link between democratic presidents and the swine flu
the president at the time was ronald reagan a republican
