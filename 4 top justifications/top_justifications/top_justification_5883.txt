no fourth graders in hillsboro aren t learning about justice fighters like antifa
beth graser a spokesperson for the hillsboro school district told us that the claim isn t true the district hasn t added antifa or black lives matter to its curriculum as justice fighters
in fourth grade hillsboro students are taught about civic engagement and there s a series of lessons called justice fighters that teach the kids about leaders who fight for justice graser said
