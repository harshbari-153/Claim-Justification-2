"In the last 6 years, there have been 420 elections for State Senator and State Representative. Only three incumbents have been defeated!"
we do the math for you just state senators and representatives did win bids over the span of six election cycles
only three incumbents have been defeated after all their districts are specially designed for them with virtually certain seats legislators have no incentive to be responsive to their constituents and they see no reason to compromise for the public good
that amounts to potential general elections in six years
there are many more elections if you count individual primaries runoffs and general elections
we checked the state division of elections site which lists every state senate and house candidate since
