Says the secret John Doe criminal investigation of his campaign has been "resolved" and two judges have said it is "over."
walker said the secret john doe criminal investigation of his campaign has been resolved and two judges have said it is over
but the next day the republican governor and potential presidential candidate said the john doe probe had been resolved and that two judges had said it was over
is walker right that the doe case has been resolved and two judges have said it is over
bottom line the john doe investigation case has been stopped for the time being but it has not been resolved
this is a case that s been resolved that not one but two judges have said is over
