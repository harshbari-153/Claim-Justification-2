A Texas law requires every high school to have a voter registrar "and part of their responsibility is to make sure that when children become 18 and become eligible to vote, that they vote."
saldaña said a texas law requires every high school to have a voter registrar and part of their responsibility is to make sure that when children become and become eligible to vote that they vote
saldaña made us wonder when he said we actually have a state law that requires every public and private high school in the state of texas to have an actual voter registrar on campus and part of their responsibility is to make sure that when children become and become eligible to vote that they vote
paul saldaña says texas law requires high school registrars to make eligible students vote
a law requires every high school to have a deputy voter registrar tasked with giving eligible students voter registration applications
so there is a law requiring each high school to have a deputy voter registrar who makes voter registration applications available to eligible students
