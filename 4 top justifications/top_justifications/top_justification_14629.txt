"How to Survive The Coming Ice Age" was a Time magazine cover story in 1977.
no a time magazine cover didn t tell readers how to survive the coming ice age
sorry the headline of writer bryan walsh s story says a time magazine cover did not predict a coming ice age
walsh notes that time did in run a story about the possibility of another ice age
the first which the post says is from shows a penguin in snow and the headline how to survive the coming ice age
back in time published a story debunking it
