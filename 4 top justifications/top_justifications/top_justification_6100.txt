Says "the Rothschild family holds about 80 percent of the worldâ€™s total wealth" and has the ability to "literally feed, clothe and settle every man, woman and child on the planet if they wanted to."
a meme recirculating the internet claims the rothschild family holds about percent of the world s wealth and thus has the ability to feed clothe and settle every man woman and child if they so choose
meme way off in claim that the rothschild family holds percent of the world wealth
the post claims that the family holds about percent of the world s total wealth and has the ability to literally feed clothe and settle every man woman and child on the planet if they wanted to
it is true that the rothschilds are quite wealthy they have been since the but to suggest they are in possession of percent of the world s wealth is a gross exaggeration
while the rothschilds certainly still have deep pockets they have produced hundreds of descendants and there is no longer any centralized family wealth nor does the family have the same kind of global power it did in the and centuries
