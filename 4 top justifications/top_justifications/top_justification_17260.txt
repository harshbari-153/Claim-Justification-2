"Boil some orange peels wit cayenne pepper in it stand over the pot breathe in the steam so all that mucus can release from yo nasalâ€¦ MUCUS is the problem its where THE VIRUS LIVES!!!"
one post on facebook claimed that if you boil some orange peels wit cayenne pepper in it and stand over the pot breathe in the steam so all that mucus can release from yo nasal you can get rid of all the mucus because that is where the virus lives
water boiled with orange peels and cayenne pepper will not prevent or cure
mucus is actually the body s first defense against virus microbes that could enter airways and blowing it out may not be the best way to protect yourself against
we also seen plenty posts suggesting that boiling orange peels or lemon peels with sea salt and inhaling that steam is a treatment
while boiling water can be used to disinfect medical equipment during a pandemic using boiling water and seasoning to clear your nose is not proven to protect you from
