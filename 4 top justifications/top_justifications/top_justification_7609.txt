Says he has "been able to attract independents and Democrats to win" elections in Pennsylvania.
our ruling we come to a mixed verdict on santorum s claim that he has been able to attract independents and democrats to win elections in pennsylvania
for this reason it may be the best test of santorum s argument that he s been able to attract independents and democrats
and in two statewide elections you know running against very strong candidates i was able to win the state of pennsylvania something a republican has done for president since
it s worth noting that in this district and much of western pennsylvania there are lots of voters who register as democrats but who are substantially more conservative than the party label would suggest
rick santorum says he won votes of democrats independents in pennsylvania
