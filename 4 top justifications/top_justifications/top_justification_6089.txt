Says Donald Trump's presidential victory was "an electoral landslide."
priebus said trump s win was an electoral landslide
but was trump s win in the electoral college the result that mattered a landslide
costas panagopoulos director of the center for electoral politics and democracy at fordham university said trump s winning percent of the electoral college vote makes it pretty close to a landslide
added boston university history professor bruce schulman to say that trump won by a landslide then obama won by even bigger landslides
still just because some candidates won by larger margins doesn t necessarily mean trump didn t win in a landslide
