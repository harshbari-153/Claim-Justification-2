the seven years war led to near bankruptcy for many countries britain s need to raise taxes fueled the american desire for independence hastings said in a tweet sunday
hastings is correct that the seven years war caused multiple countries including great britain to plunge into debt
however even though great britain won the war because of its strong navy it spent a great deal of money on the conflict which it then tried to get from the colonies
in order to pay it off great britain taxed the american colonies
furthermore if britain had offered the colonists representation in parliament before the war gained more momentum the movement for independence probably would have fizzled out duval said
