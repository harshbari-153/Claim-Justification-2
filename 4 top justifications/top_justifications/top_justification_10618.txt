Says that in 1770 "British parliament banned lipstick, saying it had the power to seduce men into marriage, which was classified as witchcraft."
the facebook post making the rounds claims that in the british parliament banned lipstick saying it had the power to seduce men into marriage which was classified as witchcraft
no british parliament didn t ban witchcraft lipstick in
however maligned some men may have felt about the deception of painted lips we could find no evidence that a lipstick ban ever made its way through parliament at any time
so despite iterations of the claim proliferating the internet for years there was no british law that instituted a lipstick ban
was the cosmetic really once banned under british law we wanted to find out
