Since 1938 the minimum wage has been increased "23 times" and was raised "21 times during Democratic congresses, and only twice during Republican ones."
a social media meme claims that since the federal minimum wage has been increased times and was raised times during democratic congresses and only twice during republican ones
there were many minimum wage increases between and all passed by democratic congresses
including the introductory federal minimum wage in the rate has indeed been raised times and of those increases came during a democratic majority in congress
the statement that democrats controlled congress of times the minimum wage was increased is accurate but needs clarification or additional information
it is also important to clarify that it isn t as if distinct votes were held to raise the minimum wage and that all those came during democratic majorities and subsequently brought about increases
