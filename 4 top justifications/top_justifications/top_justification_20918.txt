"Bernie (Sanders) is a communist."
based on sanders political views is he a communist
walker says without qualification that sanders is a communist
no bernie sanders is not a communist contrary to scott walker claim
bernie is a communist who admires communist dictators and he should never be president of the united states of america
but he echoed others in saying sanders proposals are more in line with the northern european brand of socialism than the authoritarian communist regimes seen in the soviet union cuba and the people s republic of china
