Reconciliation was used "for tax cuts for the rich twice under Bush."
here we wanted to check grayson statement that reconciliation was used for tax cuts for the rich twice under bush
the tax cuts were also passed by reconciliation
bush tax cuts were passed with reconciliation votes
grayson is correct that the tax cuts were both passed by reconciliation
still the wealthy did receive significant benefits from the tax cuts since they pay the most taxes and that was particularly true of the package
