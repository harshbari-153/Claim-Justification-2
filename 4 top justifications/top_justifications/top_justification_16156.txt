"Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined."
since america has put more people back to work than europe japan and all advanced economies combined
obama said since america has put more people back to work than europe japan and all advanced economies combined
in other words the number of people put back to work in the united states exceeds the net total for all other advanced economies combined
from publicly available data we know that since the united states has created more jobs than the other advanced economies combined
this puts a damper on the notion stated by obama that we ve put more people back to work in recent years
