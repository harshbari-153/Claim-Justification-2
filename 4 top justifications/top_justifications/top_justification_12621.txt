The United States has "one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world."
but all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world
obama s statement is actually more accurate than toomey s because he hedges a bit by saying that the united states has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world
barack obama in state of the union says corporate tax rate is among world highest
with the highest corporate tax rate among oecd nations
we should be lowering corporate tax rates because we have the highest in the world right now
