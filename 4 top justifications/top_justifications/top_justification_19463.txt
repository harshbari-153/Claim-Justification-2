"Even after Syrian troops began to shoot protesters in the streets with live ammunition in 2011, Clinton labeled Bashar al-Assad a â€˜reformer.' "
but even after syrian troops began to shoot protesters in the streets with live ammunition in clinton labeled bashar a reformer
rubio said even after syrian troops began to shoot protesters in the streets with live ammunition in clinton labeled bashar a reformer
is rubio right that clinton labeled syrian president bashar a reformer
as the military crackdown on syrians worsened clinton called on assad to go
so clinton s line about assad as a reformer was stated as the opinion of members of congress of both parties rather than as her personal opinion
