"Every day, oil continues to pour into the Gulf of Mexico. ... Even with disaster on our coast..., Richard Burr voted to let big oil off the hook."
even with disaster on our coast and iran using oil money against us richard burr voted to let big oil off the hook
every day oil continues to pour into the gulf of mexico and oil money pours through the halls of congress the narrator says
we agree it fair game for americans united for change to link campaign contributions from the oil industry to votes that support industry positions and it within acceptable political discourse for the group to say that burr and his fellow republican senators voted to let big oil off the hook by their vote on the murkowski resolution
given the focus in both the narration and the visuals on the oil spill we think that reasonable people watching the ad would assume that the vote it references to let big oil off the hook would have something to do with the spill itself such as a vote to limit bp liability for paying damages
burr next time look out for america clean energy future not big oil profits
