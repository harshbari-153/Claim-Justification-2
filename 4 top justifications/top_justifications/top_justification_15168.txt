Says Gov. Rick Perry is "by far and away the highest-paid state employee on an hourly basis."
white citing available schedule says perry is per hour the state worker
where does that leave white s statement that perry is far and away the state worker on an hourly basis
hold that thought white told reporters in austin june that if you divide the hours perry works in by the amount he s paid then he s by far and away the state employee on an hourly basis
perry s hourly wage is more than double those amounts per white s calculation of his working hours based on events posted on his official schedule
for starters perry s hourly wage as calculated by white is less than what we calculated for several state employees coaches
