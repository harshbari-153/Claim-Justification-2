Says a question about his financial skills at the CNBC debate included "discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents."
rubio said the premise of questions about his financial skills are discredited attacks from democrats and my political opponents
well you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from democrats and my political opponents and i not gon na waste seconds detailing them all he said
it s not accurate for rubio to refer to the issues as discredited whether his opponents have used them to attack him or not
at debate rubio calls tally of financial mishaps a pack of attacks
the response made us pause because we wondered what had been discredited about rubio s widely reported financial mishaps
