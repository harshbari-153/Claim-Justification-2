There is a provision in the economic stimulus plan that means that "students cannot meet together in their dorms, if that dorm has been repaired with this federal money, and have a prayer group or a Bible study."
what this means is students can not meet together in their dorms if that dorm has been repaired with this federal money and have a prayer group or a bible study
but we think it misleading for demint to claim that if enacted the stimulus plan would surely mean that students ca hold a prayer session in a dorm
demint says stimulus plan would bar students from having prayer meetings in dorms
maybe someone will bring a lawsuit as demint claims if students hold a bible study in a dorm that has been renovated with federal money from the stimulus plan
the fact is any university or college that takes any of the money in this bill to renovate an auditorium a dorm or student center could not hold a national prayer breakfast there any longer because of what is written in this bill
