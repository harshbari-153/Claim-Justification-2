Regarding the USA Freedom Act, "There is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before."
rubio said regarding the usa freedom act there is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before
so if we are directly comparing the old bulk data collection program to the new program established by the freedom act the government has more tools to access a larger array of records cutting against rubio s point that there is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before
rubio responded let me be very careful when answering this because i don t think national television in front of million people is the place to discuss classified information so let me just be very clear there is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before
he said the replacement law the usa freedom act not only respects civil liberties by stopping the government from automatically collecting bulk data but it also expands the government s ability to gather terrorists phone records
the usa freedom act changes things by keeping these records in the hands of the phone companies
