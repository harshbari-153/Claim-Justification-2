Says Brendan Kelly "spent his career" supporting Nancy Pelosi.
but to single out pelosi in particular and even madigan and say kelly has spent his career supporting them is a stretch
so how has kelly a prosecutor spent his career supporting pelosi and madigan
we asked the bost campaign again how does pelosi s fundraising help show that kelly a county officeholder spent his career supporting pelosi and madigan
brendan kelly liberal record and fundraising speaks for itself and shows that he already in pelosi pocket
so how has kelly spent his career supporting the top democratic legislative leaders we asked the bost campaign and the answer is still puzzling
