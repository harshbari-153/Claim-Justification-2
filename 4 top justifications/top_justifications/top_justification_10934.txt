Says Barack Obama "signed the law authorizing federal agents to snatch protesters off the streets" in Portland, Ore.
no obama did not sign a law allowing protesters to be snatched off the streets
when everyone just blames trump but forgets who actually signed the law authorizing federal agents to snatch protestors off the streets in portland
the reference appears to be a law obama signed regarding the military detention of suspected terrorists not domestic protesters
it claims that obama signed the national defense authorization act and that section allows the president to detain anyone indefinitely for any reason
federal agents can detain protesters but they don t have authority to merely snatch them off the streets
