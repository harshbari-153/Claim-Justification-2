Of $60 billion Congress approved in response to Hurricane Sandy, "only 10 percent was for disaster relief."
congress just adopted a billion stimulus package of which only percent was for disaster relief
al cardenas says of congress approved after hurricane sandy percent was for disaster relief
add in the billion that house republicans called immediate support to the victims and communities impacted by hurricane sandy aid such as emergency food assistance army corps of engineers repairs disaster loans small business grants and training and employment services and it totals at least percent without even considering aid in the bill
still cardenas suggested just billion of congress aid package was for disaster relief
but just the very narrow appropriations for fema s disaster relief fund and flood insurance program more than double that number even if it may not all go to sandy victims
