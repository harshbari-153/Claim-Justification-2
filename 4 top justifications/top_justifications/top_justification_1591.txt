"Senator McCain would pay for part of his (health care) plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare — $882-billion worth."
it turns out senator mccain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in medicare worth
and barack obama in recent days has tried to do just that portraying john mccain s health plan as filled with looming spending cuts for medicare s nearly beneficiaries
still the center for american progress fund analysis flatly assumes mccain will cut medicare benefits and services when mccain has not even broached the idea in speeches or statements
because mccain s campaign says the health plan would be budget neutral meaning it would be paid for by savings from medicare and medicaid the center for american progress automatically assumes the savings would come from cuts to the big health programs
mccain s senior policy adviser douglas has talked about further policy changes including extending tax credits so some americans wouldn t have to enroll in medicaid the health program for the poor
