covid surges among most vaxxed communities says harvard study the headline said
the headline on a youtube video suggested that vaccinations don t help fight claiming that the disease surges among most vaxxed communities according to a harvard study
the study did find high rates of infection in communities with high rates of vaccination
it found that after delta became the most dominant variant unvaccinated people were five times more likely to be infected than fully vaccinated people and more than times more likely to be hospitalized or die
but the study itself analyzed the relationship between the percentage of population fully vaccinated and new cases reported over a period across countries and across counties in the united states
