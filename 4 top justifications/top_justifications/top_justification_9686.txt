In 1992, Barack Obama directed "Project Vote - an arm of ACORN that also encouraged voter registration."
here we look at the allegation that in obama directed project vote an arm of acorn that also encouraged voter registration
this year project vote and acorn worked together on a nationwide voter registration drive aimed at minority and youth voters
obama started directing the project vote voter registration drive in april and ran it the rest of the year until election day
the voter registration drive came at an early point in obama political career
acorn itself says obama did work for them during that time
