Says the Obama administration was doing pattern-or-practice investigations of discrimination by police departments and "Donald Trump came in with Jeff Sessions and undid those."
harris said the obama administration did investigations of discrimination by police departments and donald trump came in with jeff sessions and undid those
obama s administration initiated at least investigations into law enforcement agencies
investigations into police departments were supported by the obama administration and disfavored by the trump administration
is it accurate that the trump administration undid investigations of police departments and consent decrees as harris claimed we found the assessment to be largely on point such investigations have not ceased altogether but they have declined and are disfavored by the trump administration
barack obama and his administration did do the work of enforcing consent decrees on police departments that had been found to engage in misconduct
