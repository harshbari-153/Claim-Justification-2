"Itâ€™s been over 50 years since minimum (wage) and inflation parted ways, then over a decade since the federal minimum went up at all."
to anyone living in fear of the myth of wages growing too quickly it s been over years since minimum wage and inflation parted ways then over a decade since the federal minimum went up at all barnes tweeted may
yes it s been decades since the minimum wage kept up with inflation and years since it increased
barnes claimed that it s been over years since the federal minimum wage stopped increasing on par with inflation and that it s been over a decade since that minimum wage increased at all
when was the last time the federal minimum wage increased
the and nominal minimum wage stopped rising together after which was years ago
