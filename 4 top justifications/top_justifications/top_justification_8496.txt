"If you shut down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, it's estimated you'd have to add seven new lanes to I-95 to accommodate the increased traffic."
during his address he made a striking comment if you shut down amtrak northeast corridor it estimated you have to add seven new lanes to to accommodate the increased traffic
using current amtrak ridership numbers polzin got a similar result that eliminating amtrak s northeast corridor would require one new lane in each direction
so amtrak would would need to run eight trains per hour to equal the capacity of one freeway lane
for instance he said if you use amtrak s ridership projections if you assume that all riders go the entire length of the corridor and if demand tends to highly concentrated in a peak hour one could get to three lanes in each direction
we should explain what the northeast corridor is
