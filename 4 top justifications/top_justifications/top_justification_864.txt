"The Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, has blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years."
the democratic leader in the senate harry reid has blocked any vote on the keystone pipeline for years wallace said
wallace said reid has blocked any vote on the keystone pipeline for years
with whitehouse s comments in mind we decided to see if wallace was correct to say reid has blocked any vote on the keystone pipeline for years
but reid has generally blocked a simple vote on the pipeline using it either as a bargaining chip or by ignoring legislation coming from the house
but to a hear a republican tell it reid attached so many strings to the keystone vote that there was no way republicans would have been able to support it
