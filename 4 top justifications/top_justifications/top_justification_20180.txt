Says video of body bags being dumped in a ditch shows the "situation in Italy" due to the coronavirus.
a video viewed thousands of times on facebook wrongly claims that footage of body bags being dumped in a ditch shows the situation in italy due to the novel coronavirus
no this video doesn t show italy s victims in body bags
in the video body bags roll down the slope of a hill and into a ditch
but the clip passed off by facebook users as footage of the situation in italy is lifted from a tv series about a fictional pandemic
in india and france matched the visual of the body bags and the audio of the voice in the clip to a scene from pandemic
