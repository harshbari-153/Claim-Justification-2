"New Mexico is the second Hollywood" because of tax incentives for the film industry.
the idea was to make new mexico the second hollywood
the incentives office which tracks inducements from various states for the industry said by that new mexico is not the second hollywood particularly with the new million rolling cap per year recently imposed on available tax credits in the state
said calling new mexico the new second hollywood is probably being a bit overdramatic
in an the johnson campaign s communications director joe hunter wrote while quantifying or even determining how to quantify that new mexico or any other state is the second hollywood is obviously imprecise governor johnson s statement was made in the context of having signed into law tax credits that were tremendously successful in attracting the film industry to the state
they passed a film incentive bill in new mexico
