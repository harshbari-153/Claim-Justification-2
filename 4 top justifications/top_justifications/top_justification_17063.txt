There is "over 20 times more energy" in a proposed Southside uranium mining site than "there is in all the oil that’s estimated to be off Virginia’s coast"
there s over times more energy in this property than there is in all the oil that s estimated to be off virginia s coast wales said
or the factor of how much more energy would come from the uranium than the estimated offshore oil
we caution that the claim is dependent both on an estimate from the uranium project developer s consultant and the unproven estimates of oil off virginia s coast
he said the mine will yield enough uranium oxide to produce more than times the power that would come from oil the state hopes to tap off virginia s shore
and he said the abundance of uranium would produce a domestic energy source that far outstrips the oil reserves virginia hopes to tap off its atlantic coast
