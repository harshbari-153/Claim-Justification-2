Obama voted for "tax subsidies and giveways" that have slowed oil companies from pursuing clean energy sources.
this bill while far from a solution is a first step toward decreasing america dependence on foreign oil obama said at the time
in when we had a chance to say no to dick cheney and his energy bill my opponent said yes and voted for it with all of those tax subsidies and giveaways that have been used by the oil companies and others to retard the development of clean renewable energy clinton said
this time while clinton rightly points out that the legislation included tax breaks for oil companies
barack obama for supporting a energy bill
however this reasoning ignores the fact that tax breaks for oil and gas producers encourage domestic production which helps reduce reliance on foreign oil
