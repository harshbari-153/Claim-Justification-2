"If Buehler were elected, our vote-by-mail system would be at risk."
if buehler were elected our system would be at risk
obviously we don t know what buehler would do if elected
is it true that buehler has a beef against the system as evidence of buehler s alleged hostility toward democrats have cited language from a column written by oregonian columnist steve duinabout republican attempts in other states to introduce new id requirements for voters
but changing the requirements of registering to vote doesn t mean the way we vote in oregon would be at risk by electing buehler
according to incumbent kate brown and other prominent democrats a vote for republican candidate knute buehler is a vote for republicans and a vote to kill our system
