Says Mary Landrieu voted to fund benefits for illegal immigrants ahead of veterans.
instead of fully funding veterans benefits she voted to give benefits to those here illegally
bill cassidy says mary landrieu illegal immigrants ahead of veterans
what would you choose to fund benefits for veterans or for illegal immigrants i would never put illegal immigrants ahead of veterans
first is the false dichotomy that landrieu had a choice between funding undocumented immigrants and veterans in the budget agreement
both cassidy and landrieu voted for this and obama signed it into law on feb
