The Green New Deal "would do away with commercial air travel."
yang said the green new deal would do away with commercial air travel
the green new deal makes no mention of air travel much less doing away with it
so what does the green new deal say about air travel in a word nothing
but his mixup may trace back to the green new deal s sloppy rollout which became the basis of the mostly republican talking point about democrats wanting to phase out commercial air travel
i mean they are right that we need to take urgent action but the timeline that they put out there would do away with commercial air travel and a lot of other things in a particular time frame that if we have a little bit more time we can head in the same direction and achieve most of the same value
