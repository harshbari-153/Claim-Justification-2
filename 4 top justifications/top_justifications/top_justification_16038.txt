Says the U.S. is developing an "antivirus" that includes a chip to track your movement.
according to a theory circulating on the internet the united states government will soon have an antivirus for the novel coronavirus that involves inserting a chip into your body to track your movements
we came across a lengthy facebook post that claims an rfid chip will be included in the antivirus enabling the government to watch your location the speed your sic walking and even what s in your bloodstream
no the us isn t developing a vaccine or antivirus with a chip to track people
what s more the term antivirus typically refers to software designed to detect and eliminate computer viruses not a vaccine for the human body
but while there is ongoing discussion of how to use technology to help track virus spread this antivirus implant notion remains very far afield from what is actually unfolding
