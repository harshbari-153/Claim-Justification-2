Viral immunologist says COVID-19 vaccinesâ€™ "spike protein" means people are being inoculated "with a toxin."
a post widely shared on social media claims a viral immunologist said vaccines spike protein means people are being inoculated with a toxin
we did realize the spike protein is a toxin does this mean everyone vaccinated is manufacturing their own spike protein toxins in their own bodies
no proof for researcher claim that vaccines spike protein is a toxin
so by vaccinating people we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin
reports of spike protein trouble are interesting and important for coronavirus infection but they do not mean that the vaccines themselves are going to cause similar problems said a may commentary in science translational medicine a publication of the american association for the advancement of science
