"He (Obama) has done several things well. Most of those things are places where he changed his view from where he had during the campaign. So, for instance, he's left our troops in Iraq and they're being more successful there. He boosted our effort in Afghanistan, which is the right course to take. He did not close Guantanamo, thank heavens."
so to sum up while romney offered backhanded praise for obama actions with regard to troop levels in iraq and afghanistan as well as the failure to close guantanamo romeny said those were all issues on which obama changed his view from the campaign
so that was obama position in the campaign
romney says the things obama has done right are essentially all things he has changed position on since the presidential campaign
so is this a departure from obama campaign stance as romney said
so for instance he left our troops in iraq and they being more successful there
