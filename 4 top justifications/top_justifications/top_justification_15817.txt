Says he "cast the deciding vote" to override a vetoed ‘born alive’ bill
bishop said he cast the deciding vote to override a vetoed bill
his vote was important because without it the override effort would fail
he was the only democrat who voted with republicans to support the override giving the gop the one vote it needed to advance the override effort
on april the senate s override vote was in favor and opposed meaning the effort advanced by one vote
