"China has been stealing our manufacturing, costing Wisconsin almost 90,000 jobs."
is china to blame for all the manufacturing jobs wisconsin lost in recent decades
the caption of the video reads china has been stealing our manufacturing costing wisconsin almost jobs joe biden does understand the threat
has china really cost wisconsin jobs
not all wisconsin manufacturing job loss can be blamed on china
so wisconsin did lose about manufacturing jobs since but is it reasonable to attribute that all to china
