when i was secretary of state i had a very high approval rating as you can go back and check
clinton said when i was secretary of state i had a very high approval rating
we wondered if her rating was really very high when she served as secretary of state from january through feb
hillary clinton approval ratings as secretary of state were high but they not now
to get some perspective on how easy it is to get an approval rating that high we consulted gallup presidential job approval center which goes back to harry truman and lists overall favorability ratings along with highs and lows
