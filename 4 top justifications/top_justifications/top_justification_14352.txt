"Donald Trump would receive $17 million for three hotels closed for four days under Republican bill! How in the hell is this right?!"
a facebook post said donald trump would receive million for three hotels closed for four days under republican bill how in the hell is this right
donald trump would receive million for hotels closed for days under republican bill how in the hell is this right
but no gop bill contained language that would have given hotels owned by the trump family million
and a relief bill passed by the senate would actually prohibit businesses owned by trump his family or other top government officials from tapping into a billion pool of aid to businesses though the trump hotels could benefit from other provisions of the aid bill
at one of president donald trump s daily news conferences on the coronavirus a reporter referenced a bill that was being debated in the senate to provide billions of dollars in relief for state and local governments as well as the cruise and hotel industries
