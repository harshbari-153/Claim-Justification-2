"The Koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett."
in fact the koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to scott walker as the total amount of money raised by tom barrett
our rating wasserman schultz said the koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to scott walker as the total amount of money raised by tom barrett which would amount to about million
so wasserman schultz is backing down from her original claim that the koch brothers gave walker million and is now saying the money came from the group the brothers founded
the article said million was spent on walker s behalf by the conservative group americans for prosperity which was founded by the koch brothers
if the congresswoman is correct david and charles koch gave walker s campaign million more than of the governor total haul
