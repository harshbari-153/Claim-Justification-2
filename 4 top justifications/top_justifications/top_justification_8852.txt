The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has amassed the "largest collection of human data in history" through COVID-19 PCR tests.
an instagram post said that the cdc had the largest collection of human data in history from pcr tests
largest collection of human data in history with no consent
the post falsely suggested that the cdc had amassed an enormous collection of people s dna through the use of pcr tests
in the past year the agency has used genomic sequencing of pcr tests to estimate the percentage of cases caused by the delta and omicron variants
