U.S. Rep. John Barrow of Georgia has helped support the implementation of "Obamacare."
barrow however voted against the original obamacare legislation and wants to repeal various parts of the law
i am strongly in favor of reforming the health care system but i don t think this bill is going to do it and therefore i can t support it barrow said before the vote
barrow also supports the provision that allows children to stay on their parents health insurance until they re years old
an argument can be made that barrow s votes against repeal are tantamount to indirect support of its implementation
so where does this leave us the nrsc says barrow s unwillingness to vote for repealing the health care law is a real life pain for people and businesses because of its costs
