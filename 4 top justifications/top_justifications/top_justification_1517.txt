Says Rick Perry wrote a newspaper item saying he was "open to amnesty" for illegal immigrants in the United States.
mitt romney says perry wrote an opinion article saying he was open to amnesty for illegal immigrants
still romney is correct that perry once wrote a newspaper saying he was open to amnesty though perry letter spoke only to a particular proposal
so perry wrote to a newspaper saying he was open to the bush amnesty proposal though any proposal would need vetting
mitt romney shot back you wrote an opinion piece in the newspaper saying you were open to amnesty for illegal immigrants
romney s claim leaves the incorrect misimpression perry is lately open to amnesty while perry has said he against amnesty for years
