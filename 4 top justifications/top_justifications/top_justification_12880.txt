The Broward Republican Executive Committee "had the liberal League of Women Voters Guide removed from the Broward Supervisor of Election's website."
our ruling the broward republican executive committee claimed on its website that in we had the liberal league of women voters guide removed from the broward supervisor of election website
broward gop activists claim we had the liberal league of women voters guide removed from the broward supervisor of election website
but one accomplishment caught our eye we had the liberal league of women voters guide removed from the broward supervisor of election website
we wanted to know did the broward gop get the broward supervisor of elections to remove a league of women voters guide from its website and was that guide or is the league itself liberal the league of women voters guide first some background on the florida league of women voters voters guide
the committee was mostly correct about getting the voters guide removed from the broward website but the guide wasn t clearly liberal
