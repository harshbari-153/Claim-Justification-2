our rating it s correct that massachusetts ranked of in job creation on romney s watch

he said something similar a year earlier during a cnn interview that people have a right to say why is it that your state was in the country in job creation when you were governor separately we checking the romney camp s rebuttal to axelrod that year by year under romney the job growth rate in massachusetts improved from in his first year in office to in his final year
however the obama camp like the romney camp in its rebuttal exaggerates romney s influence on the state job market
