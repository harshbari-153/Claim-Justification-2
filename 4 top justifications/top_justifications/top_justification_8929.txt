"Report: Biden administration busing ‘thousands’ of illegals to red states to get permanent status."
report biden admin busing thousands of illegals to red states to get permanent status was the way one widely shared headline put it
in other words the article under the headline alleged the biden administration is busing migrants to states in an effort to add democratic voters there
no report does not say biden administration is busing migrants to red states
and though the report says these migrants could pursue more permanent legal status later there is no indication that this is a voting scheme
the claims were hung on a report by the center for immigration studies a think tank that argues for low levels of immigration
