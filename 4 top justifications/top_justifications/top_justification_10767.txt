An April 7, 2015 referendum would take "the choice of chief justice" of the Wisconsin Supreme Court "away from the people."
the greater wisconsin committee said an april referendum would take the choice of chief justice of the wisconsin supreme court away from the people
so is the greater wisconsin committee right would the referendum take the choice of chief justice of the supreme court away from the people when the voters don t directly elect a chief justice
she adds near the end our democracy and your vote are threatened by a referendum april that takes the choice of chief justice away from the people
would wisconsin voters no longer decide who leads the state supreme court
wisconsin voters are being asked in the april election whether to amend the state constitution to change how the chief justice of the supreme court is chosen
