Jim Renacci "voted repeatedly to end Medicare."
betty sutton says jim renacci has voted repeatedly to end medicare
a new campaign solicitation emailed by sutton s campaign referred to renacci as someone who has voted repeatedly to end medicare
the first was a wall street journal article from april that according to the campaign said the ryan plan would essentially end medicare
it said ryan plan effectively would end medicare for seniors
the partial quote deceptively truncates what the article said the plan would essentially end medicare which now pays most of the bills for million elderly and disabled americans as a program that directly pays those bills
