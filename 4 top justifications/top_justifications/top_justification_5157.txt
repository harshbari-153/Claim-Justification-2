Says a bill he vetoed to give driver licenses to certain immigrants known as Dreamers would have changed "nothing."
rick scott says bill he vetoed to give driver licenses to daca immigrants changed
scott said that nothing changed for certain illegal immigrants to get driver licenses in a bill he vetoed
in the legislature passed a bill to give driver licenses to those with deferred action for childhood arrivals sometimes called dreamers
but he is overstating the situation when he says nothing changed because that bill would have affirmatively given those immigrants the right to use their daca forms to get a driver s license even if their work permit didn t arrive simultaneously
but some news reports characterized scott s driver license veto as largely symbolic since immigrants could still get a driver license with the federal work permit
