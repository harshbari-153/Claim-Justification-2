David Dewhurst has a "record of promoting an income tax."
ted cruz says david dewhurst has a record of promoting a texas income tax
all told the idea that dewhurst has a record of promoting an income tax is so far from accurate it s ridiculous
cruz told us the wage tax that dewhurst promoted is effectively the same thing as an income tax though dewhurst he said wasn t foolish enough to use the label income tax
dewhurst appears to have reconsidered his comment the next day or perhaps recognized how it might be taken as a politically risky call for a state income tax
dewhurst whose post of lieutenant governor is nearly as powerful as governor in the state is calling a wage tax
