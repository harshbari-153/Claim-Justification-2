"There are so many loopholes ... our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world."
here s the problem there are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code oftentimes with support of senator mccain that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world
but we also think obama s assertion that these deductions result in the united states having one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the world similarly oversimplifies things
the nonpartisan tax foundation noted in a news release this summer that while america has left the major features of its business tax system unchanged over the past years virtually all developed nations have lowered their corporate tax rates potentially hurting the competitiveness of the united states
so for example the united states ranks second lowest in the world among industrialized nations when it comes to the effective corporate tax rates for investments in machinery
right now the united states of america s businesses pay the business taxes in the world percent
