In Georgia, "hard-earned lottery dollars are doled out to the scion[s] of wealthy families."
what s this about the scions of wealthy families getting lottery dollars this makes georgia sound like a bumbling robin hood taking from the poor and giving to the rich
where lottery dollars are doled out to the scion s of wealthy families targeting mayor reed seems wasteful and naive s statement said
a study by rubenstein estimated that households that made or less or between and each year gave more to lottery funds than they received in college scholarships and other benefits
and income families tend to receive more of the scholarship s benefits even though families tend to spend a greater share of their money buying the lottery tickets that fund hope
but wealthy families do get it at higher rates
