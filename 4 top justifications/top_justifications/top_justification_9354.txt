"We are almost halfway to our goal of 1,000 rapes prosecuted!"
we are almost halfway to our goal of rapes prosecuted
if the goal was to have rapes prosecuted comes pretty close to almost halfway
mcginty said his office is almost halfway to his goal of prosecuting rapes as a result of testing a cache of thousands of previously untested rape kits
but what does mcginty mean by almost halfway to our goal of in terms of rapes prosecuted
our rape kit task force will solve and prosecute forgotten rape cases
