The Bush administration has "the Pentagon trying to take away the signing bonuses when a soldier gets wounded and ends up in the hospital, something that I'm working with a Republican senator to try to make sure never can happen again."
they want to recruit and retain these young people to serve our country and then they have the pentagon trying to take away the signing bonuses when a soldier gets wounded and ends up in the hospital something that i working with a republican senator to try to make sure never can happen again
also misleading is her suggestion that there was some kind of bush administration effort to deny future bonus payments promised to wounded vets
so while clinton highlights a legitimate issue paying future installments of enlistment bonuses even after wounded veterans have been discharged her wording is somewhat misleading suggesting wounded veterans are being forced to return bonus money
the issue clinton addresses was first raised in july by the bipartisan commission when in the course of work with veterans and their families they noticed that service members remaining enlistment bonuses were not being paid when they were injured and medically retired or separated from active duty
the army suggests this issue may all be a tempest in a political teapot that it simply made a clerical error in asking a wounded vet to return a portion of his signing bonus
