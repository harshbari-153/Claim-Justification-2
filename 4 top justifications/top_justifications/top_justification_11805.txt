in this item we deal with a statement from nlrc legislative director douglas johnson that the baucus bill contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and cooperatives that pay for elective abortion
national right to life committee says baucus bill would permit federal subsidies to go to insurance plans that cover abortions
regarding johnson claim that the baucus plan would result in federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and cooperatives that pay for elective abortion we think he is on solid ground
