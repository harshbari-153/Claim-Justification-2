"We're going to be looking at $8 billion a day that we're going to be pouring into foreign countries in order to import that make-up fuel that we're going to need to take the place of what we could have gotten out of the gulf."
so we going to be looking at billion a day that we going to be pouring into foreign countries in order to import that fuel that we going to need to take the place of what we could have gotten out of the gulf
is going to be looking at billion a day that we going to be pouring into foreign countries in order to import that fuel that we going to need to take the place of what we could have gotten out of the gulf
so a drop in oil production of barrels a day in the gulf of mexico in would mean the purchase of an additional barrels a day from imports
as we mentioned in our accompanying palin figures on declining gulf of mexico oil production were high but close
by the most generous accounting the cost of that dip in oil production and the substitution of imports comes to a little less than million a day
