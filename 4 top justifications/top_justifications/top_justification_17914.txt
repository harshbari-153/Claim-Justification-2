"Pope Francis kissing the hands of David Rockefeller & John Rothschild."
pope francis kissing the hand of david rockefeller john rothschild the post says
but the man whose hand pope francis is holding in the photo is neither a rothschild nor a rockefeller
pope francis was also photographed holding his hand
pope francis was photographed with holocaust survivors not rockefellers and rothschilds
now an image of the pope kissing a man s hand while other men look on is being framed as a moment involving both families and the leader of the catholic church
