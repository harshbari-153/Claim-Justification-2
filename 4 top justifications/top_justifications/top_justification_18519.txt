We are "borrowing Saudi money for Saudi oil" with the result being "dependency and debt."
in the world capital markets often we are even borrowing saudi money for saudi oil
for us the result is both dependency and debt
but there no direct line between borrowing money from the saudis and buying their oil said dean baker of the center for economic and policy research in washington dc
we are borrowing from foreign lenders to buy oil from foreign producers he said in a houston speech
does borrow more than it saves and we import large quantities of oil to satisfy our energy expenditures
