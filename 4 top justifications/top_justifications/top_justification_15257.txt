Virginia ranked 35th in job creation in 2009 under Gov. Tim Kaine, and moved up to third for 2010, while McDonnell has been in office.
under that set of numbers which measure total jobs gained or lost each year the governor accurately said virginia ranked under kaine and third under the mcdonnell administration
based on percentage of the work force virginia job creation went from being under kaine to fifth under mcdonnell which is not nearly as dramatic
gov bob mcdonnell says his job creation record tops former gov tim kaine
that matches the governor s claim and mcdonnell is right that virginia s job creation trailed only the jobs new jobs in texas and the jobs added in pennsylvania during the period
we wondered about two things are those rankings correct and do they provide an accurate picture of virginia s job growth compared to the rest of the nation stacey johnson mcdonnell s press secretary told us the figures were taken from the federal bureau of labor statistics which gathers the nation s job and unemployment information
