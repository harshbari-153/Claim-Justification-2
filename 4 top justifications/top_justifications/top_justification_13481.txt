"The LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group."
lynch said the lgbt community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group
i think we have to keep our eye on a larger picture here which is the victims of this crime were from a community that is often marginalized and that frankly the lgbt community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group she said
he found that lgbt lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people are far more likely than other minority groups to be victimized by violent hate crimes
by that measure there were more hate crimes against than lgbt residents
answering the question as to why the lgbt community would be victimized at a higher rate is more complex
