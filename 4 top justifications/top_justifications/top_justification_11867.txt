"Republican leadership has not been clear about whether they support Rep. Ramthunâ€™s illegal and undemocratic resolution" on the 2020 election.
while republican leaders have largely followed the gop line on other election issues vos steineke and others have clearly said the ramthun s resolution is illegal and can t work and every member of the assembly leadership team signed on to a statement disagreeing with the approach
neubauer said republican leadership hadn t been clear about whether they supported ramthun s impossible quest to pull back wisconsin s electoral votes
republican leadership has not been clear about whether they support rep
so the two lawmakers whom most people would consider leaders of the assembly both said previously they did not agree with ramthun s resolution
but neubauer s claim wasn t about vos s broader actions on elections it was about ramthun s resolution in particular
