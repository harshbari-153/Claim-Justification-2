the chinese government over women rights and standing up for human rights
human rights groups were concerned her participation in the conference would amount to an implicit endorsement of chinese policies
she said i went to beijing in and spoke out for women rights and human rights
hillary clinton takes credit for pressuring the chinese government to recognize women rights and for taking the beijing government to task for its overall human rights record
it is time for us to say here in beijing and the world to hear that it is no longer acceptable to discuss women rights as separate from human rights clinton said
