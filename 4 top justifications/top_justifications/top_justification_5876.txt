Says a lack of transparency for small-dollar donations is the "same thing" as dark money
donations to certain groups the term dark money typically refers to political spending where the source of funds is unknown
is it true that small aggregated donations are exactly the same as big dark money donations experts say this is an oversimplification
however federal and state laws don t require the same level of transparency for the smallest donations
experts say it s also misleading to equate the influence of small donations and big anonymous donations
contributions from small donors through the actblue and winred platforms are not the same thing as money in that they are disclosed by those platforms regardless of how small by law said pete quist research director for the national institute on money in politics
