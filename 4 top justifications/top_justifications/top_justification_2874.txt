The "Buffett rule" "raises virtually no money, maybe a day and a half of our borrowing per year."
our ruling senate candidate barry hinckley says the buffett rule would annually raise only a day and a half of what the federal government borrows every year
republican senate candidate barry hinckley says the buffett rule would raise the equivalent of a day and a half of what the nation borrows every year
if we use the billion figure we calculated the buffet rule would raise the equivalent of about four days of the nation s borrowing
but does the amount really correspond to just a day and a half of what the united states borrows annually hinckley s statement relies on two numbers how much the nation borrows on a daily basis and how much the buffet rule would raise per year
our calculations yield a number closer to a day and a quarter which would actually bolster hinckley s point that the tax plan raises virtually no money
