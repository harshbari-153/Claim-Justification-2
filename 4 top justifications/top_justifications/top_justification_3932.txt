"I have a perfect voting record from organizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and all the other veterans service organizations."
the reason why i have a perfect voting record from organizations like the veterans of foreign wars the american legion and all the other veterans service organizations is because of my support of them he said
not perfect with all the veterans
likewise the iraq and afghanistan veterans of america a relatively new group that was instrumental in pushing for the expanded gi bill says mccain only voted veterans way on percent of the senate votes it tallied between and
but of late mccain has taken heat from antiwar veterans groups such as votevets
to be sure the vfw and the legion have given mccain awards in the past and can be fairly described as mccain supporters
