Under his tax plan, "the greatest gains, percentage-wise," will be "at the lower end of our plan."
rubio said that according to the tax foundation the greatest gains will be at the lower end of our plan
the greatest gains for people are going to be be at the lower end of our plan he said
in fact the largest gains are for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan
looking at it this way the greatest gains would not be at the lower end of our plan as rubio put it
however it s important to remember that in raw dollars these gains are relatively modest compared with the total benefits that would accrue under the tax plan at the upper end of the income spectrum
