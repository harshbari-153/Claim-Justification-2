"As the election tracker FiveThirtyEight has reported, whoever wins Pennsylvania will be our next President."
it s true that at various points in its coverage fivethirtyeight strongly emphasized pennsylvania s potential to be the deciding vote
does pennsylvania really have the power to decide the president
naturally the dialogue has evolved as the election has gotten closer and so fivethirtyeight s certainty in predicting pennsylvania to be that state with the most tipping power has also varied
when asked for comment aaron bycoffe pointed us to a may article about the topic but again the headline reads why pennsylvania could decide the election
fivethirtyeight s actual election tracker still leaves ambiguity as to pennsylvania s ultimate tipping power
