Says COVID-19 relief bill "provides more funding to foreign governments and to American arts centers, than to the American people."
a facebook post claimed that a relief bill provides more funding to foreign governments and to american arts centers than to the american people
shortly after lawmakers agreed on sending stimulus checks to many americans facebook users said the relief bill put foreign interests and the arts above the needs of the american people
the total of the foreign aid and domestic funding mentioned in the facebook post is not greater than the funding in the relief bill
the overall spending bill included funding for american arts centers and foreign aid but that funding was not included in the relief bill
but it s wrong to suggest that such funding is in the relief bill
