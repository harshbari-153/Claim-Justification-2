A video shows "the COVID-19 vaccine when it hits your blood."
a video of small balls connecting and growing on their own is being described in a social media video as the vaccine once it hits your bloodstream
a woman says it shows the covid vaccine in a lab under a microscope and its reaction when it hits the blood
no this isn t a video of a vaccine
and in case you didn t catch that false claim she repeats it this is the vaccine when it hits your blood
the actual ingredients of vaccines are publicly available online thanks to the centers for disease control and prevention
