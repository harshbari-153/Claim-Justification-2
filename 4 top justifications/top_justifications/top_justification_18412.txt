The health care law was "a 2,733-page bill! . . . No amendments!"
for the health care bill back in the house and senate had each passed different versions
what about the other the health care bill began in committee in both chambers of congress as virtually all bills do
if we re going to put an official page count on the bill we would put it at but we recognize that the bill had several different versions as it was on its way to becoming a law
this was a bill
the two parties were never very close together on what a new health care law should include
