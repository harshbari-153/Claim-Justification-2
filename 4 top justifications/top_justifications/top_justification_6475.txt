The Presidentâ€™s Daily Brief "is like a mini novel."
kilmeade said the president s daily brief is like a mini novel
what s the president s daily brief not like a mini novel as fox news host says
the president gets a president s daily brief which is like a mini novel every single day said fox friends brian kilmeade
but his claim that the brief is like a mini novel mischaracterizes the length and style of the classified document that is meant to keep the president up to speed on critical national security matters
it is not as long as a typical novel or novella
