"There was no requirement to put in affordable housing."
kennedy said there was no requirement to put in affordable housing at his wolf point development because the property was grandfathered in under rules that applied before adoption of the city s affordable housing ordinance
nevertheless kennedy is correct in stating no legal mandate required him to include affordable housing at his wolf point development
in response kennedy told chicago columnist mary mitchell there was no requirement to put in affordable housing saying the wolf point property was zoned in decades before the city implemented its affordable housing ordinance
even though kennedy and his wolf point partners faced no legal obligation to add affordable housing it s also worth noting in light of his complaints about emanuel that nothing stopped them from doing it voluntarily
chicago s affordable housing ordinance wasn t enacted until years after the land was initially zoned so kennedy s claim he was under no legal mandate makes sense on its face
