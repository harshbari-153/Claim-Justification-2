Says Hillary Clinton is proposing "destroying Medicare for seniors."
said clinton is proposing destroying medicare for seniors
still we wondered whether there is any plausible interpretation of her actual medicare policy proposals in which they could end up destroying medicare for seniors
given how popular the health care program for seniors is it was pretty obvious to us that clinton wouldn t have put the proposal destroy medicare on the issues page of her website
donald trump wrong that hillary clinton is proposing to destroy medicare
nothing i am aware her saying to date would imply that she aims to dismantle the current medicare program or take away benefits that seniors currently enjoy or bankrupt the trust fund that is used to finance some current medicare benefits for seniors she said
