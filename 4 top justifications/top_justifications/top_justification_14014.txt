"Whales live as long at SeaWorld" as they do in the wild.
a seaworld ad said whales live as long at seaworld as they do in the wild
seaworld says their whales live as long as wild whales do
here though we wanted to drill down on seaworld s specific claim that the whales at their parks live just as long as they do in the wild
seaworld currently has in its care several whales in their and one in its
experts also noted that logic suggests captive whales should live longer because they do face predators and receive medical care which makes seaworld claim further misleading
