"We have cut taxes more than 40 times in four years."
scott said we have cut taxes more than times in four years
we have cut taxes more than times in four years scott said during his speech to open the legislative session

a list his office sent us last year with things they considered tax cuts likely explains that sum
he altered his definition in to include more revenue reductions for less than million as tax cuts
