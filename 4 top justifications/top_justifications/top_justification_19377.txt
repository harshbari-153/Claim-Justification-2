"NASA will pay you $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days!"
a misleading blog post is claiming nasa will pay you to stay in bed for days
a recent blog post claims nasa will pay you to stay in bed for days
don t believe that nasa will pay you to stay in bed
we found out that nasa has paid people to stay in bed for long periods of time before
the post which is on the website world facts ftw claims that nasa wants volunteers to participate in bed rest studies as it wants to study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel
