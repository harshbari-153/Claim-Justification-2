"Gov. Romney's own health care plan in Massachusetts ... requires by law that a representative from Planned Parenthood sit on the MassHealth advisory board."
it is true the massachusetts state law passed under romney leadership gave the planned parenthood league of massachusetts a seat on an advisory board for masshealth the state medicaid health insurance program for the poor
but the board advises masshealth on service costs and reimbursement rates not policy and the board members represent the state major providers of medical care including the extended care industry physicians hospitals and community health centers as well planned parenthood
planned parenthood is massachusetts largest provider of sexual and reproductive health services with patient visits last year at four clinics statewide the group says
thompson campaign further charges that although planned parenthood got a seat on the board antiabortion groups did not
masshealth only pays for abortions deemed medically necessary or in the case of rape or incest
