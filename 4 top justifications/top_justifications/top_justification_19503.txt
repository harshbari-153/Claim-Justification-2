"Seven out of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates (have) Republican governors â€¦ That approach that Republicans are using is working."
the fact that seven of the states with the lowest unemployment rates are led by republicans is hardly evidence that gop governors trump democrats in creating jobs
we wanted to see if gop governors really do lead most states with the nation s lowest unemployment rates and if they do whether that means republican chief executives are better at creating and protecting jobs than their democratic colleagues
so under the law of averages about six of the top states should be run by gop governors
seven out of the states with the lowest unemployment rates have republican governors mcdonnell said at politico s feb
our ruling mcdonnell said republican governors head seven out of states with the lowest unemployment rates providing proof that the gop has a better record on jobs than democrats
