"Police officers in this state have that right," to check the immigration status of people they arrest.
this time we want to check the claim that florida police officers are able to check the immigration status of individuals who have been arrested
florida police officers are able to check the immigration status of those who are arrested
in other words florida police officers can in theory check the immigration status of someone pulled over for a traffic stop but there is currently nothing in state law that would require them to do so
in other words arizona police officers are required to check an individual immigration status even if that individual is not under arrest
currently police officers in this state have that right already
