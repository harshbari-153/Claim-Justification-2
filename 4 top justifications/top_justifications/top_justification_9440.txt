Under President George W. Bush, the U.S. had "52 months of ... uninterrupted job creation" and "revenues were at an all-time high in 2007."
uninterrupted job creation longest in the history of the country and revenues were at an high in
did bush preside over months of uninterrupted job creation close but not quite
we might add that over the course of bush presidency a total of months the economy created
so if gillespie point is that bush tax cuts led to record revenues they did for at least but that was a record aided by a the largest economy in american history
that may sound like a lot but compared to every other war ii president prior to obama it the lowest average annual percentage increase in jobs created
