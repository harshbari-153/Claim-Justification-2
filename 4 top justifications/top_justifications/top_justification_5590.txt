Page 992 of the health care bill will "establish school-based 'health' clinics. Your children will be indoctrinated and your grandchildren may be aborted!"
he wrote pg govt will establish school based health clinics
the liberty counsel a conservative group puts a different twist on that concern alleging that page of the bill will establish clinics
and here the important part the bills now before the house say nothing about the school clinics being able to offer abortions
federal and state governments have long provided funding to support these clinics which tend to crop up in areas where students have limited access to other health care services
basically the bill would provide grants so the clinics can continue providing comprehensive health assessments diagnosis and treatment of minor acute and chronic medical conditions and referrals to and for specialty care
