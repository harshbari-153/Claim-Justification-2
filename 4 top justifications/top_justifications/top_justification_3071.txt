In April 2009 "the Democrats were in control, and the congressional (approval) rating was 40 percent."
the democrats were in control and the congressional approval rating was percent
this compares to the most recent three polls asking this question which showed congressional approval below percent
still all the other polls during that period were lower and the average for the polls is percent still short of the percent mark that pelosi cited
strictly speaking pelosi s incorrect congressional approval didn t hit percent during the month of april
nancy pelosi tells jon stewart congressional approval rating was percent in april
