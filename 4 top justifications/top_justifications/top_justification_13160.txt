The "error rates" for the Fulton County elections department are "well below the average."
fulton commissioner emma darnell said the number of errors by the county s elections staff was well below the average
politifact georgia was curious to determine whether fulton s error rates were below average but we encountered a roadblock
i did some checking on my own to see what are the error rates for elections departments as large as this one
from the evidence available the county s recent history and the high number of provisional ballots cast in this month s election there s not much evidence to back up darnell s claim that fulton was well below the average
one uniform method to count votes though is provisional ballots which appeared to be a problem for fulton on election day
