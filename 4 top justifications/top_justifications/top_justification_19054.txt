"Itâ€™s just crazy that the government will ... make it illegal to use the old [incandescent] bulbs."
he continued it s just crazy that the government will make us make us force us make it illegal to use the old bulbs and we have to use these new ones and that is just tyranny
a light bulb went off here at politifact and we wondered is it true that it will be illegal to use our old bulbs when we asked stenhouse to shine some light on his statement he referred us to a video of a speech on the floor of congress by u
