The Banking Committee voted a 1,336-page bill "out of committee in 21 minutes with no amendments, with the understanding that before the bill came to the floor, we would reach this bipartisan agreement."
i think that very likely corker responded adding that the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs voted the bill out of committee in minutes with no amendments with the understanding that before the bill came to the floor we would reach this bipartisan agreement
we had an opportunity to pass out a bill out of our committee in a bipartisan way and then stand on the senate floor and hold hands and say that we would keep amendments that were unnecessary and improper from coming onto this bill
here what banking committee chairman christopher dodd had to say the day his committee passed the bill the legislation i present today contains bipartisan ideas and is the result of a bipartisan effort
so corker is correct that it only took the committee about minutes to debate and vote on the bill and he also right that democratic leaders promised more bipartisan negotiation before the legislation comes to the senate floor
according to congressional quarterly the panel approved the legislation in less than minutes
