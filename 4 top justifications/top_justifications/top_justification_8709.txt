U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., "and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out"
ron kind and other house democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out
kind and his fellow democrats the committee declared went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out
republican group says ron kind and other democrats spent so much that their credit card is maxed out
for our item the question is whether spending by kind and his fellow democrats are the reason the federal credit card has been maxed out
this is a lot like living on a credit card and asking the bank for a higher limit an analogy that republicans happen to like too
