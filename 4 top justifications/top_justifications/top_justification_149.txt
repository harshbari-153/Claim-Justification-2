Says he will pursue change in federal law to protect employees from "extortion from a union" because "the Supreme Court has ruled that federal prohibitions outlawing extortion usually do not apply to unions."
walker said he will pursue change in federal law to protect employees from extortion from a union because the supreme court has ruled that federal prohibitions outlawing extortion usually do not apply to unions
but that case had to do with an employer being extorted by a union and walker s claim is about changing federal law to protect workers from what he terms as union extortion
his plan also calls for changing federal law saying it does not protect employees from threats violence and extortion from a union
as it stands walker claims in the plan the supreme court has ruled that federal prohibitions outlawing extortion usually do not apply to unions
so in the context of workers being extorted by a union has the nation s highest court ruled that federal prohibitions against extortion usually don t apply
