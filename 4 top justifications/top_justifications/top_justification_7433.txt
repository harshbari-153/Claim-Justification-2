this is the first time a party has picked up multiple seats during a regular election since the mid making this the largest majority of any party in more than years said incoming senate president mike haridopolos in a interview on nov
first was this the first time since that a party had picked up multiple seats during a regular election second is this the largest majority of any party in more than years picking up seats this election season the gop picked up five state house seats formerly held by democrats and two state senate seats
how accurate was haridopolos in stating this is the first time a party has picked up multiple seats during a regular election since the mid making this the largest majority of any party in more than years his comment was clear that he was referring only to the state senate with multiple seats and he could have been slightly more accurate by specifying since the late
