"ISIS is in 32 countries."
and what happened is now isis is in countries
trump said isis is in countries
but we wanted to know if trump count of countries with an isis presence is correct
a june congressional research service report identified nine countries where isis had a serious presence
this is not quite the same of course as saying isil is countries
