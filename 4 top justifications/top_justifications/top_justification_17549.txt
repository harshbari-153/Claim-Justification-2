Obama thinks the national anthem should be "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing."
opponents of barack obama seem to have found a new reason to dislike him he wants the national anthem to be an old jingle
we wrote about the anthem issue previously here which was part of a chain email falsely claiming obama refused to say the pledge of allegiance
and the anthem itself conveys a message
if that were our anthem then i might salute it
i like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
