"For every [coyote] they kill, the population will replace and usually multiply."
but we were more interested in the petition s claim that killing coyotes just leads the animals to replace and usually multiply the numbers
what they do not take into consideration is that for every one they kill the population will replace and usually multiply the numbers reads the petition
population reduction as a management option usually requires annual reapplications due to the reproductive capabilities and ease of movement of coyotes he and his wrote in one paper
we searched for someone who might argue that killing coyotes can reduce populations
local population reduction can provide temporary relief to sheep operators but only until the local coyote population compensates for the removals and fills vacant territories
