coronavirus isn t the common cold
the coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses that includes the common cold but the two are not the same
and yet claims likening coronavirus to the common cold persist including in a facebook post that says
most strains of the coronavirus are relatively mild and take the form of respiratory diseases such as the common cold
a cdc describing common human coronaviruses said most people contract some type of coronavirus during their lives and that the more common strains usually cause mild to moderate illnesses like the common cold
