"Unemployment now pays $24/hour, even if your wages were lower. Why don’t ‘essential’ people forced to still work get $24, too?"
unemployment now pays even if your wages were lower
the post says unemployment now pays even if your wages were lower
furthermore the stimulus does not boost pay for people still on the job including essential workers who earn less than per hour
but that goes to the unemployed as well as the employed
why don t essential people forced to still work get too
