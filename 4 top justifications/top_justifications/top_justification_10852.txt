When the United States "first created the federal income tax, frankly, nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything."
in a period following a speech to the southern republican leadership conference the georgia republican said that when the united states first created the federal income tax frankly nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything
but to us it not enough to make up for his ignoring several million americans when he claimed that nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything in federal income taxes
so that means that perhaps percent of americans were millionaires and yet were subject to the federal income tax
the first tax form in was even called the
the first federal income tax was imposed during the civil war but it was scrapped in and not revived until after ratification of the amendment to the constitution
