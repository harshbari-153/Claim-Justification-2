Bruce Starr was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws and greater accountability.
bruce starr claims to be the only state senator to vote for stronger ethics laws
but what caught our attention in the tv spot was this claim spoken by the announcer bruce starr was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws and greater accountability
but to say he was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws is wrong
the only senator was starr the only yes vote on sb and if the bill was so ethically swell why didn t the other senators vote yes too but wait starr didn t vote for senate bill at all
starr s was the only no vote in the senate as well as in the house on final passage
