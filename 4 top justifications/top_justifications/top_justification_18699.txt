The Obama administration has spent millions of taxpayer dollars for roadside signs to tout the economic stimulus.
took aim at signs with an amendment that would prohibit the use of stimulus funds to pay for signage promoting the administration spending of taxpayer dollars on stimulus projects
bennett says stimulus is spending too much on road signs promoting stimulus
bennett asserted that the administration is wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on a pr campaign
it s true that the federal government is providing the stimulus money for these highway construction projects
so whether stimulus signage is costing millions as bennett suggests depends heavily on what you assume to be the prevailing national price of making and posting a sign
