"The KKK was formed by the Democratic Party."
stephen martin also claimed that the kkk was created by democrats
while some democrats supported the kkk there s no evidence the group was founded by their political party
i hate when people aren t smart enough to realize that the kkk was formed by the democratic party reads a facebook post from oct
no the democratic party didn t create the ku klux klan
one historian confirmed there s a historic link between the democrats and the kkk many angry southern whites during the and were democrats and some joined the kkk
