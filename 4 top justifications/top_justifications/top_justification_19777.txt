The U.S. energy policy is to "borrow money from China to buy oil from countries that don't like us."
two wars a warming planet an energy policy that says let borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that do like us warner said
we do think warner meant it literally as if it were written down somewhere when he said our policy is to borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that do like us
and you could just as easily say that we borrowing from a number of other countries to pay for oil
economists also caution against linking our country foreign debt to our dependency on oil
the united states does borrow more than it saves and we import large quantities of oil to satisfy our energy needs
