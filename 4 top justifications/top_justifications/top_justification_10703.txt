"We had bipartisan legislation that got through the Senate" that would have prevented bonuses like AIG's "and then somehow mysteriously disappeared."
the tragedy is it should have been done a month ago when we had bipartisan legislation that got through the senate and then somehow mysteriously disappeared
back in early february you and senator snowe added an amendment to the stimulus bill that i think would have prevented aig from giving out these millions of dollars worth of bonuses maddow said to wyden
as public outrage builds over bonuses issued by bailout recipient aig two senators are claiming they tried to outlaw such bonuses but were thwarted by the white house and fellow lawmakers
that amendment was taken out of the bill
given the fact that the president to his credit called these bonuses shameful and time is short where do you stand on getting a solution to the problem of these excessive bonuses in the economic stimulus legislation wyden asked
