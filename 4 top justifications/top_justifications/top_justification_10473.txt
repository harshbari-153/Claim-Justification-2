castro said section immigration policy which makes it a crime to enter the country illegally was put into place in by a segregationist
this is a law that was put into place in by a segregationist by the way
technically blease a white supremicist who advocated for segregationist policies and lynching was not the author of the statute on illegal entry into the united states as it exists in today s immigration code
before this law was adopted the united states essentially had open borders but the century saw a shift in thinking about illegal immigration as a problem stemming from mexico rather than from asia and europe according to a article in the loyola university chicago law journal
but it was the first policy criminalizing all unlawful entry at the nation southern border and is considered the foundation of the policy that evolved into today section
