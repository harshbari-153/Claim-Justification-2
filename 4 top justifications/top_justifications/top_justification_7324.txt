Domestic violence "is seen as a pre-existing" health condition and "women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender ratings," but under Obamacare, "all of that is over."
moore said domestic violence is seen as a health condition and women had to pay percent more for health care because of gender ratings but under obamacare all of that is over
we also need to see how the health care law handles domestic violence and gender rating
so we need to determine whether being a domestic violence victim is regarded as a health condition and whether women have had to pay percent more for their health care because of gender rating
she s correct that the affordable care act eliminates the treatment of domestic violence as a condition and eliminates gender rating
politifact national rated obama s statement true because at the time eight states permitted treating domestic violence as a condition according to the national women s law center
