"Sorry Dr Fauci and other fearmongers, new study shows vaccines and naturally acquired immunity DO effectively neutralize COVID variants."
so we asked the experts are covid variants effectively neutralized by vaccines or natural immunity conferred on people who recover from the illness
paul an eye doctor by training continued the squabble a few days later calling out fauci in a tweet pointing to a study that he said shows vaccines and naturally acquired immunity do effectively neutralize covid variants
neutralizing antibodies are important because they can block the ability of a virus like the one that causes covid to infect cells
even so clinical trials used to test covid vaccines before they were approved for emergency use showed lower efficacy when tested in areas where the south african variant was circulating
we expect vaccines and prior infection to offer significant protection against variants that are closely related said goodman
