"These are real ads running in New York City calling for the removal of ‘trash’ which includes white people, Trump supporters, and Christians."
facebook post featuring the image says these are real ads running in new york city calling for the removal of trash which includes white people trump supporters and christians
no these aren t real nyc sanitation ads
but cuomo s sentiment hasn t made its way into an ad campaign from the new york city sanitation department despite the claim of a viral facebook post
nyc sanitation tweeted unauthorized posters illegally affixed to some litter baskets are being removed
those weren t real ads either as the facebook post claims
