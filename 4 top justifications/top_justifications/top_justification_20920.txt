Exxon sign says drivers "must show proof of a job for gas purchase."
must show proof of a job for gas purchase the sign says
no this isn t a real exxon gas station sign
gasoline shortages are affecting some gas stations around the country and social media users are sharing what looks like an exxon sign limiting who can pull up to a pump
that s because anyone can punch in the text they want to appear on the sign at a website that lets you make your own gas station sign
the same cars are idling in the parking lot
