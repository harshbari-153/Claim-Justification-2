Says Ron Johnsonâ€™s company got government loans and a grant to help expand his business
russ feingold says opponent ron johnson s business benefited from a government loan
johnson acknowledges the government s role and benefits to his company
that question is whether johnson in fact received government aid or subsidies
when it comes to describing johnson s company as getting government aid the feingold ad is correct
johnson says he was not part of the company when the grant was approved but helped get the firm off the ground months later
