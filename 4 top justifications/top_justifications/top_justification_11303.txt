"There isn't a system" for reuniting families separated under Trump’s zero tolerance border policy.
maddow said there is a system for reuniting families separated under trump s zero tolerance border policy
following the initial uproar over president donald trump s zero tolerance border policy the focus shifted from the administration s separation of families to questions about what it was doing to put families back together
crucial disconnects exist among key agencies tasked with implementing trump s family separation policy
but the joint policy announcement makes clear the federal government s approach to family reunification applies only for the purpose of deportation
david fitzgerald who the center for comparative immigration studies put it this way the zero tolerance policy was implemented with zero planning for putting families back together again
