On home health workersâ€™ low pay and limited benefits, "40% are still on SNAP or Medicaid."
forty percent are still on snap or medicaid
these numbers further back up biden s assertion about the number of home health workers on medicaid or snap
but home health workers aren t paid much they have few benefits
biden said home health workers were paid very little citing a statistic that of these workers relied on public assistance programs like snap and medicaid as evidence
and one more bit of evidence that biden was on the right track the national employment law project noted that many of these workers supplement their home care work with other jobs to make ends meet
