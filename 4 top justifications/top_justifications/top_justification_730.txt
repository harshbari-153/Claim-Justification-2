will deny north carolina state employees retirees and their families of access to critical healthcare services
do state health plan changes deny state employees access to care
the health association s claim says folwell s plan would deny north carolina state employees retirees and their families of access to critical healthcare services
for this reason many hospitals and doctors across the state have refused to agree to join the state health plan s new network
because of this folwell s changes would cause some state health plan members to lose access to providers which would most affect people in rural areas who don t have an provider in their vicinity
