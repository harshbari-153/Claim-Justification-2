"Texans pay the sixth-highest property tax in the nation."
patrick said texans pay the property tax in the nation
when we looked into this topic before advocates including dick lavine of the center for public policy priorities and dale craymer of the texas taxpayers and research association suggested we consider a comparison study by the lincoln institute of land policy showing that property owners in the biggest cities of texas especially houston and san antonio had some of the highest property taxes in compared with large cities in other states
for starters the rankings showing texas with the sixth highest mean effective property tax rate on housing haven t been updated the foundation s jared walczak said to our inquiry
property taxes might be higher here because unlike most states texas levies no state income tax
dan patrick mostly right texans pay nation property taxes
