"Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his (Ted Stricklandâ€™s) watch."
republican governors association says ohio lost jobs on gov ted strickland s watch
ohio lost jobs on his watch is the opening line for one of the ads
so even if the campaign phrase ohio lost jobs on his watch is stuck in a voter s head the claim does not reflect the larger economic backdrop one that both democrats and republicans in charge of states admit produced results out of their control
strickland argues that ohio like michigan and other midwest states was especially hurt by forces beyond his control namely a recession and the decline of manufacturing
the two were beating up on strickland for the state s job losses
