nope an elderly woman with an did not rescue lapd officers from gang members
the story goes that this woman looked out her kitchen window and saw two los angeles police officers struggling to match a local street gang s firepower
naturally the woman then donned her bulletproof vest busted out her personal assault rifle and saved the officers by firing off rounds at the gang members
in addition to the text being fabricated the photo caption of the officers who were supposedly saved misidentifies the officers in the photo
since then numerous fake news websites have the story presenting it as a true act of heroism
