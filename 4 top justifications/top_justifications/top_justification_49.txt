Hillary Clinton said, "with a straight face, that the terrorist attacks this weekend were caused by Donald J. Trump"
how deranged does hillary clinton have to be to say with a straight face that the terrorist attacks this weekend were caused by donald j
trump surrogate and former georgian newt gingrich recently posted on facebook that hillary clinton said the new york terrorist attacks were caused by donald j
but did clinton really say trump caused the bombing politifact decided to take a look
hence she is blaming trump for the attacks this weekend
gingrich spokesman joe desantis emailed that in the aftermath of the attacks clinton launched into a tirade at a press event in which she connected trump to terrorist recruiting and by inference to the attacks
