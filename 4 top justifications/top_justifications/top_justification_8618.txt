"The only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because â€¦ twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created."
i mean notice the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created
in this item we ll check the claim that the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created
however he overplayed his hand by arguing that the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because of labor force shrinkage
using the appropriate survey data the decline in the unemployment rate stemmed in roughly equal parts from job creation and a shrinking labor force
so in a literal sense gingrich is wrong that the shrinking labor force is the only reason the unemployment rate is going down
