Says "all my grandparents" immigrated to America.
again it is clear clinton was wrong when she said all my grandparents immigrated to america
talking about immigration in iowa clinton said all my grandparents you know came over here
in iowa hillary clinton claims my grandparents came to the from foreign countries
an unidentified clinton spokesman admitted the error in a statement to buzzfeed saying clinton s grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants
it s very clear from the evidence that not all of hillary clinton s grandparents were immigrants
