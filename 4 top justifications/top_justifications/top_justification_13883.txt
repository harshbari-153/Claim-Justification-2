The Convention Center "was sold as a building that would never cost taxpayers a dime."
seriously morgan said it was sold as a building that would never cost taxpayers a dime and it continues to cost us money
morgan says the convention center was sold with the pledge that it wouldn t cost taxpayers
that s a big number and it made us wonder did someone really say this facility would never cost taxpayers a dime if so what were they talking about
this made him the front man in for the campaign to sell the public on the need for a convention center which was expected to cost million
and richard oster did famously tell the public that the center wasn t going to cost the taxpayers a dime
