Three presidents in the last century — Harding, Kennedy and Reagan — all cut taxes during recessions and produced "rapid and dramatic economic recoveries," while two, Herbert Hoover and Barack Obama, did "the opposite."
we ve had two presidents in those years who reacted to recessions by doing the opposite herbert hoover in the early who radically increased taxes and spending and who imposed unprecedented burdens on trade and the other is barack obama
three presidents within the last years have responded to recessions by reducing taxes and regulations mcclintock said
harding kennedy and reagan each acted to lower taxes and in fact each of them staked some political capital on it
said obama and herbert hoover were ineffective at dealing with recessions
for instance tax cuts and deregulation likely aided the reagan recovery as did volcker efforts but historians say that higher defense spending another reagan priority also helped bring the united states out of recession as did historically lower oil prices
