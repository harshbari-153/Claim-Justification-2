right now sanders said in every major poll national poll and statewide poll done in the last month six weeks we are defeating trump often by big numbers and always at a larger margin than secretary clinton is
as we did previously we looked at polls taken during the last six weeks that are listed on realclearpolitics
and it s worth adding that as meet the press host chuck todd noted clinton can be expected to poll better against trump after she officially secures the nomination and many former sanders supporters come to her side
an additional five polls tested only clinton against trump but we won t count those
