Californiaâ€™s Proposition 63 would "CRIMINALIZE the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together."
the firearms policy coalition recently claimed california s proposition would criminalize the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together
we decided to examine the claim would proposition really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends
recently a gun rights group the firearms policy coalition in a june email blast claimed proposition would restrict not only ammo sales but criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners
the coalition s statement however gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet that somehow the measure would criminalize all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner
mostly false claim that california gun control measure will the sharing of bullets
