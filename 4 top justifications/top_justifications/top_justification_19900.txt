While in the Illinois Senate, Barack Obama passed "tax cuts for hard-working families."
here we look at a claim we checked previously that obama won tax cuts for families
the record shows obama was a minor in cutting taxes in and was the leader in the state senate in in making the tax credits permanent
it what he did in the illinois senate moving people from welfare to jobs passing tax cuts for families and making sure women get equal pay for equal work
in the illinois bill that obama state taxes can go to zero but there is no additional refund
obama sponsored earned income tax credit
