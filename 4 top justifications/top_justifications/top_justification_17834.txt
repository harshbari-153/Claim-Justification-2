Three courts have found the new health care law constitutional and two have found it unconstitutional.
while republicans have been trying to repeal last year patient protection and affordable care act in congress critics have challenged the new health care law in court mostly asserting that the provision that requires individuals to buy health insurance or pay a penalty is unconstitutional
two courts have found it unconstitutional to have the individual mandate the one that makes people take personal responsibility to have insurance
obama said judges had rejected the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional
three courts have found that it is constitutional said roosevelt
so the score is three rulings upholding the law two finding it unconstitutional
