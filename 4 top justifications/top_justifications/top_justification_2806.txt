"Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement."
by the way when senator obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the north american free trade agreement the canadians said and we sell our oil to china
barack obama position on the north american free trade agreement
what we take mccain claim to mean is that obama said he would renegotiate nafta whether or not canada and mexico the other signatories to the trade agreement want to do so or renegotiate in such a way as to impose additional burdens on them but not on the united states
there little indication canada wants to renegotiate the agreement so it not clear how obama would do so without initiating the negotiation unilaterally
but only a bit the fact is obama has often spoken of nafta in such a way that a fair listener would conclude he would press to renegotiate it regardless of how the other parties feel
