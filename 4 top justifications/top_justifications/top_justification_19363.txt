A video shows Kim Jong Un calling Joe Biden a "thug," a "coward," and "mentally unstable" in a speech.
a viral tiktok video purporting to show north korea s kim jong un bashing president joe biden as a thug a coward and mentally unstable is not what tiktok users are claiming
in fact the video is just the opening lines of a speech in which kim jong un is simply addressing his audience
but the video circulating on tiktok does not show kim insulting biden in kind despite what its subtitles suggest
viral tiktok video of kim jong un uses english subtitles
joe biden is a weak president and an insult to north korea
