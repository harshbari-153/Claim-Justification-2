"Only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action."
only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did harry reid and senate democrats take action
cassidy said that only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did harry reid and senate democrats take action
is it true that senate democrats only moved to fund new veterans health clinics after the scandal broke in april
if that were the case it would mean that senate democrats had decided to take up the house bill after the scandal hit which isn t true
it s fine for cassidy to say democrats bear some responsibility for not taking up the simpler house legislation but it s incorrect for him to claim that it took the scandal to propel democrats into efforts to pass a va bill
