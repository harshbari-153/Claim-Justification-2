A mailer from the Obama campaign "accurately indicates" that Hillary Clinton would "force uninsured people to buy insurance, even if they can't afford it."
the mailer states in part the way hillary clinton health care plan covers everyone is to have the government force uninsured people to buy insurance even if they ca afford it
but obama defended the mailer saying that it accurately indicates that the main difference between senator clinton plan and mine is the fact that she would force in some fashion individuals to purchase health care
obama mailer makes it sound like clinton plan is a law and that clinton is concerned with cost
it been unfortunate that senator obama has consistently said that i would force people to have health care whether they could afford it or not clinton said adding my plan will cover everyone and it will be affordable
clinton plan achieves that with an individual mandate requiring every person in the country to either have insurance or buy it
