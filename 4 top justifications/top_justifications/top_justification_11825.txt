"Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties in U.S. are illegals."
million illegal immigrants living in hud properties
our ruling the facebook post says nearly of all occupants of hud housing in u
among them was the claim that nearly of all occupants of hud housing in u
the closest but unverified estimate we could find for illegal occupants in hud housing is less than percent nationwide
clearly there are some illegal immigrants living in hud housing and there are rules that might allow them to stay but in no way do the numbers match the claim that percent of hud housing residents are illegals
