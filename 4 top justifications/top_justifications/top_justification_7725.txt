a facebook post implies that a baby s immune system can t handle antigens from vaccines because new food must be introduced slowly to identify allergic reactions
there are antigens in vaccines but they are in very small amounts less than what a baby encounters in their daily environments according to the cdc
vaccines use small amounts of antigens or parts of germs to help babies recognize and learn to fight diseases
vaccines given to babies do not overload their immune systems according to the cdc
