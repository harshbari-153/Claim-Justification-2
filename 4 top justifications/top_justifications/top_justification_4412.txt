Says Kamala Harris inaccurately "claimed to be bussed in the 60â€™s due to segregation type issues."
kamala harris claimed to be bussed in the s due to segregation type issues one post says
back when kamala harris and joe biden were opponents in the presidential campaign and not running mates she drew attention during a debate in for attacking the former vice president for his record on busing to integrate segregated schools
harris didn t say that she was bussed in the s as the facebook post claims
with its wth tag the facebook post implies that harris was inaccurate in saying she was bused to desegregate public schools
and the post s comments are full of claims that harris lied
