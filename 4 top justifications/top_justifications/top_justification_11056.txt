Says Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said, ‘You will give up your guns, if you don’t I’ll have the National Guard cut your power, your phone lines, and your internet. Then, if you still refuse to comply I’ll have you killed.’"
you will give up your guns if you don t i ll have the national guard cut your power your phone lines and your internet
no northam will not cut off power kill virginians who refuse to give up guns
but there s no evidence that northam would order the national guard to cut off power phone lines and internet or otherwise punish those who disobey any ban that takes effect
the ban does not spell out how it would deal with firearms that virginians already own and northam told reporters on dec
then if you still refuse to comply i ll have you killed the meme posted dec
