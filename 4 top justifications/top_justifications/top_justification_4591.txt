"President Barack Obama (is) the first president in history to cut Medicare by $700 billion."
that cbo estimate is cited as the supporting source for the claim in the brochure that obama is the first president in history to cut medicare by billion
aimed specifically at seniors the brochure says they can count on romney but not on president obama the first president in history to cut medicare by billion
that s why claims that obama would cut medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate
ohio republican party says obama cut medicare by billion
neither obama nor his health care law literally cut a dollar from the budget of medicare which operates as a health insurance plan for americans over age
