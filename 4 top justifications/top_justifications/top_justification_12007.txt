During the 2005 fight over Social Security, "there were noisy demonstrations — but they were outside the events," and opponents were "not disruptive — crowds booed lines they didn’t like, but that was about it."
yes there were noisy demonstrations but they were outside the events
congressmen were very upset by the reception they received but not at least according to any of the reports i can find because opponents were disruptive crowds booed lines they didn t like but that was about it
may have been angrier and more widespread than the ones in it would be incorrect to suggest as krugman does that the noisy demonstrations against bush policies were only taking place outside the events or that disruptions were limited to the occasional boo
most of them as he also notes inspired protests outside some of them loud and unruly and all of them kept at a distance by the secret service
still the protests inside and outside town halls even if they were not universal clearly rattled republican leaders
