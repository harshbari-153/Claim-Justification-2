A CDC report found that "people who wear masks, are actually ‘collecting’ the virus in their masks."
a facebook post says that a cdc report found that people who wear masks are actually collecting the virus in their masks
this means that people who wear masks are actually collecting the virus in their masks
of these people who tested positive for the virus reported that they always wore masks or cloth face mask coverings
the facebook post s claim that masks are collecting infectious airborne particles mischaracterizes the science behind masks and how they stop viral spread
the cdc continues to recommend that people wear masks in public settings and when around people who don t live in their home
