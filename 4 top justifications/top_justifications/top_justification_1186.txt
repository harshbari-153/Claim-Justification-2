SaysÂ Senate Republicans are "following a longstanding tradition of not filling vacancies on the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election year."
mcconnell said senate republicans are following a longstanding tradition of not filling vacancies on the supreme court in the middle of a presidential election year
it is more than a stretch for mcconnell to say it s a tradition for the senate not to fill a supreme court vacancy in an election year
mcconnell s use of the phrase longstanding tradition is misleading as the senate has chosen not to fill a supreme court seat that opens up during an election year just once in the past years
of those nominations the senate confirmed hardly proving that mcconnell or his democratic opponents have reason to claim tradition
there are more examples in the past century of the senate confirming supreme court nominees for seats that open up in election years though it is still a rare occassion
