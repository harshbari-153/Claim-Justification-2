"What were the old annual deficits under Republicans have now become the monthly deficits under Democrats."
and since that budget was ignored he said what were the old annual deficits under republicans have now become the monthly deficits under democrats
but was hensarling right that the old annual deficits under republicans are now the monthly ones under the democrats only if you do some serious
hensarling says annual deficits under republicans have become the monthly deficits under democrats
in fact many of the monthly deficits since the recession began and which fall under the watch of bush and a congress have routinely rivaled the monthly deficits under obama
some would argue that to cut out the recession years when the deficit exploded is unfair and we agree but even under that scenario hensarling statistic does hold up if you consider the average monthly deficit under democrats full control rather than one particularly high month
