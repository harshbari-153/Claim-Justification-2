Says Howard Zinn, "an anti-American Marxist," wrote "the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America."
do you know the most popular textbook that taught in our high schools in america is written by a man named howard zinn who is an marxist and that is the most common textbook santorum said in the april speech
santorum said that zinn wrote the most popular textbook that taught in our high schools in america
so we find no evidence to support the statistical claim that zinn s is the most popular textbook that taught in our high schools in america
we won t take a position on the merits of zinn s historiography but we will look at the evidence for whether santorum is correct that zinn is the author of the most popular textbook that taught in our high schools in america
is book by howard zinn the popular history textbook
