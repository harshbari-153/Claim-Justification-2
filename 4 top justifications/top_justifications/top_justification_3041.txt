"Under those eight years before (Barack) Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States" since Sept. 11, 2001.
moments after mentioning giuliani said under those eight years before obama came along we didn t have any successful radical islamic terrorist attack in the united states
still giuliani seemed to throw everything he had just said out the window by the way under those eight years before obama came along we didn t have any successful radical islamic terrorist attack in the united states
aside from rudy giuliani is wrong about no terrorist attacks before obama
in addition to these attacks the new america foundation has documented a handful of thwarted terrorist plots before obama s presidency
terrorist attacks that were unsuccessful or with unknown motives
