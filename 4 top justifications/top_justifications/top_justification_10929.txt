"When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years (when) wages effectively went down. Now, for the first time in a long time, they're starting to go up for people."
when i was campaigning i was talking about and years and wages effectively went down
trump said when i was campaigning i was talking about and years when wages effectively went down
on trump s watch wages initially went up and then fell enough to wipe out the accumulated gains
it might be reasonable to describe the overall wage pattern from the mid to the mid as stagnant or unimpressive but it s not the case that they effectively went down over those two decades
the significant upward trend in wages began in almost three years before trump was inaugurated and even before he had declared his candidacy for president
