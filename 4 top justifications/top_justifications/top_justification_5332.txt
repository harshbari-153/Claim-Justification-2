You canâ€™t donate plasma after getting a COVID-19 vaccine.
we previously looked into claims that vaccine recipients can t donate blood
numerous social media posts have recently claimed that people who get the vaccine can t donate plasma but that s wrong
vaccine recipients can donate plasma
but some people may be confused over whether vaccine recipients can donate plasma or not because the red cross said it wasn t accepting convalescent plasma donations from people who have received a vaccine
the fda allows people who have received the vaccine to donate convalescent plasma within six months of their infection of the virus
