Says a photo of a young girl crying alongside an ISIS member is a Christian being forced into sexual slavery as a child bride.
a picture is worth a thousand words and one photo of a young girl crying with a man s arm around her shoulder and an isis flag in the background is provoking a lot of words and assumptions on social media
the video shows the isis member who was misleadingly presented as the young girl s groom having a small chat with her before she recites verses of the quran
this young lady is being sold into sexual slavery as a child bride
no this photo does not show a young girl being sold to muslims as a child bride
we could find no other account in which the girl was reported to be a child bride or a christian who just witnessed her father being beheaded and her mother raped
