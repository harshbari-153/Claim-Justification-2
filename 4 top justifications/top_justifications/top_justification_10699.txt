Says Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm is a "career bureaucrat with no past ties to Wisconsin."
in a facebook post tiffany called palm a career bureaucrat with no past ties to wisconsin
state health secretary andrea palm is not from wisconsin but tom tiffany muddled his point
what about a career bureaucrat
defines a bureaucrat as a member of a bureaucracy which is a body of nonelected government officials or an administrative group
when he refers to palm he says in full the power grab by a career bureaucrat with no past ties to wisconsin will be challenged
