"We have been teaching these (Common Core) standards in Florida schools since 2010."
while defending a bill that sets new rules about school grades adkins said we have been teaching these common core standards in florida schools since
has florida been teaching common core standards since
but the fact that we have been teaching these standards in florida schools since tells me that our students should be prepared for this assessment
this year florida is fully implementing common core in grades while other students are learning a blend of the existing next generation sunshine state standards and common core standards
florida has been teaching common core since says janet adkins
