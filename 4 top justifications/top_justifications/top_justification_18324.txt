"In the 2000 Florida election, at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly dropped from voting rolls in an attempt to purge a list of felons. Many of those who were dropped showed up to vote and were told they could not."
in the florida election at least eligible voters were wrongly dropped from voting rolls in an attempt to purge a list of felons nelson wrote
however nelson s broader point that a significant number of people were wrongly tossed from florida s voter rolls is valid
many of those who were dropped showed up to vote and were told they could not
the post s count included at least citizens who were cleared after the election and people who committed felonies in other states they were supposed to retain their civil rights even in florida
as part of their elections reforms state lawmakers told the department of state to remove felons and other ineligible voters from the rolls after thousands of corrupt votes including votes by felons were cast in a miami mayoral election
