Says Donald Trump, in his campaign announcement speech, "also said, â€˜And many of them (Mexicans) are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote."
pence said that trump in his campaign announcement speech also said and many of them mexicans are good people
mike pence tidies up donald trump quote about mexicans as people
according to pence trump said that many mexicans are good people
pence has a point that there was more to trump s comment than just that mexicans are rapists and criminals as kaine said during the debate
in reality trump said some rather than many which doesn t sound as magnanimous
