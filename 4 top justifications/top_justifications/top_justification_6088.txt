did congress budget enough for the promises made under the obamacare law but not those in medicare part d and was part d far more expensive
obamacare law was funded and expected to save billions not so for medicare part d
medicare part d wasn t funded in that a source of money was not created or dedicated to offset all its costs say a tax increase or other funding mechanism
