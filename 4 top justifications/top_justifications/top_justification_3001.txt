Says Jennifer Aniston said, "Me and all the Trump supporter celebrities decide to make a company named ‘celebrities for Trump’"
a march headline by universal news portal falsely quoted aniston as saying me and all the trump supporter celebrities decide to make a company named celebrities for trump which fight against all anti trump celebrities i think president trump needs our support
actress jennifer aniston is not really forming a company to support president donald trump despite a hoax you might have seen on facebook
headline that jennifer aniston formed for trump is fake news
we found no evidence that aniston has formed any group for celebrities to promote trump
aniston doesn t appear to be particularly active in politics though she did appear with other celebrities at a hollywood hills lunch fundraiser for democrat hillary clinton in august
