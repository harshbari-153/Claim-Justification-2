Says Nike pays factory workers, 80% of whom are women, "20 cents an hour" and has them work "70 to 80 hours a week."
it is true that at one time nike paid factory workers close to cents per hour and that many worked over hours a day six days a week
today nike pays workers more than cents an hour and employees work on average a little less than to hours per week
viral social media posts claim that nike s factory employees work to hours a week and get paid cents an hour
just so i clear these factory workers which are female are making nike for cents an hour and working to hours a week so nike can profit enough to pay colin kaepernick millions to speak out against oppression and injustice
the organization told us that the numbers for the pay and hours aren t precise but the sentiment with regard to fair pay and treatment is correct factory workers for nike and other major sportswear brands such as adidas and under armour do not earn anywhere near a living wage
