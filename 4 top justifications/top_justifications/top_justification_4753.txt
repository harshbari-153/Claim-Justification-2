"Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans."
about the european stake in a climate change bill passed by the house of representatives the editors wrote is wildly unpopular with americans
ibd editorial board claims that is unpopular in america
so given the most recent polling it would be fair to say that a slight majority of americans support but that those numbers may decrease depending on how much it would cost in higher utility bills
to support their claim the board included a june rasmussen poll that shows that percent of americans said they would pay more taxes to cut greenhouse gases
a washington post news survey published on june a day before the bill was passed showed that percent of americans think the government should regulate greenhouse gas emissions to reduce global warming
