The debt-ceiling bill "doesnâ€™t cut the debt. It will add about $7 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years."
the bill didn t add about trillion in new debt as he put it instead it fails to stop that debt from being added
technically the debt that will be added is not a result of the debt ceiling bill itself as demint indicated
and that only strengthens demint s point that this bill doesn t cut the debt
this bill doesn t stop deficit spending
it will add about trillion in new debt over the next years on the backs of our children and grandchildren
