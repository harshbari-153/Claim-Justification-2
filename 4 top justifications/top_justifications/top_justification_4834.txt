The pipe bombs were never mailed.
no truth to claim that pipe bombs were mailed
who among you has mailed anything a pipe bomb uses steel piping
as false flag conspiracy theories take hold in the wake of reports that pipe bombs were sent to critics of president donald trump some facebook users are pointing to a picture of a package as evidence explosives were never even mailed
so bloggers are right that the packages had six stamps but the pipes used to make the ieds were lightweight plastic not steel
was arrested on suspicion of sending explosive packages to brennan hillary clinton and barack obama among others
