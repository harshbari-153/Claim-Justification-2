"The legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios."
together the democrat and republican lawmakers wrote the legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning million to studios
our ruling algiere and his fellow legislators from westerly and charlestown say the legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning million to studios
algiere says legislators never got chance to debate loan guarantee for curt schilling studios
studios was never mentioned on the floor as a subject or even a concept said watson but i got up and railed against the legislation just as a generic principle because i feared there was something afoot
while the legislature did overwhelmingly approve the loan guarantee fund it s clear from news stories at the time and afterward and from the tape of the debate that legislators did not know when they voted that million was meant for studios even if some of their leaders did
