Elderly people were "beat up by a BLM hate group" for being white.
disturbing photos showing badly beaten elderly people are being misrepresented in a facebook post that claims they depict people who were attacked by a black lives matter group for being white
all the images in the collage have been circulating online since at least and are predominantly used in posts and blogs to claim that white south african farmers are under attack
the images are legitimate but the claim that the injuries were inflicted by black lives matter activists is wrong
a facebook page called white south african genocide shared the image and claimed els was attacked by a black man
some have also been misused to claim that immigrants in europe are violent
