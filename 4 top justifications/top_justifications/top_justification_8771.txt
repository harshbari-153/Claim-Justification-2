"Children donâ€™t seem to be getting this virus"
brandtjen claimed children don t seem to be getting this virus
in a phone call with politifact wisconsin she said her choice of words in saying that children don t seem to be getting the virus acknowledged that nuance
that said children do not seem to be contracting the virus as much or as seriously as the rest of the population
but is brandtjen right about the rest of her claim that children don t seem to be getting this virus
so children do seem to be getting this virus
