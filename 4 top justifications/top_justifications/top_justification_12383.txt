The "boyfriend loophole" means that "if you commit a serious crime of domestic abuse against your wife, you can't get a gun, but if you do it against your girlfriend, you can."
klobuchar said the boyfriend loophole means that if you commit a serious crime of domestic abuse against your wife you ca get a gun but if you do it against your girlfriend you can
the loophole she said on msnbc means that right now if you commit a serious crime of domestic abuse against your wife you can t get a gun but if you do it against your girlfriend you can which is outrageous
federal law s boyfriend loophole is not so simple
klobuchar s claim of a loophole is accurate to the extent that the law does not apply to a boyfriend who is or was simply dating the victim but not sharing a residence or children
that provision applies to anyone who has or had a domestic relationship with the victim said university of wyoming law professor george mocsary of a law school textbook on gun laws
