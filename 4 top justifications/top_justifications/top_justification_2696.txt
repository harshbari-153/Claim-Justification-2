The 2020 election results in Pennsylvania "show a statistically impossible pattern" and votes were manufactured for Joe Biden.
a blog post that argues for an audit of the presidential election in the swing state of pennsylvania claims results there show a statistically impossible pattern and accuses election officials of deciding to manufacture votes for joe biden
and trump s challenge didn t apply to enough votes to alter the result
it also casts doubt on biden s share of the absentee ballot haul stating biden took of the absentee ballots
no evidence that vote results in where trump lost were impossible
the counting of mail ballots and the way it eroded trump s early advantage was the expected result of pennsylvania s election rules not fraud
