Says President Barack Obama "doubled the national debt, which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate, in one year."
our ruling a chain circulating in new jersey claims obama doubled the national debt which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate in one year
obama doubled the national debt in one year chain states
no apologies just a ridiculous attack on president barack obama for doubling the national debt in one year
there s no doubt that the national debt has increased significantly since obama took office but it s outrageous to claim it doubled in one year
the national debt has increased significantly during obama s tenure but it never doubled in one year
