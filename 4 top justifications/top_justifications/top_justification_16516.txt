Says Oregon is "near the top or at the top of the list" when it comes to capital gains tax
tobias read says oregon has one of the highest capital gains taxes in the nation
percent oregon will still rank as one of the highest second only to hawaii and in some cases massachusetts
generally speaking a state s capital gains tax rate is only as high as its highest income tax rate
capital gains taxes have quickly become a hot topic at the state capitol
having a rate that puts us near the top or at the top of the list makes it more difficult for us as a state to get to the rest of the discussion about the other great things that are in oregon he said
