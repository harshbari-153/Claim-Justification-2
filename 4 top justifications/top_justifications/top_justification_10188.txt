"Unions did not create" the eight-hour work day and the 40-hour work week. "Henry Ford did."
a viral image said that henry ford not unions created the work day and the work week
we wondered whether it was correct that henry ford rather than unions should get credit for creating the work day and the work week
does the day and the week come from henry ford or labor unions
unions did not create
but neither law was and in most sectors working hours of to hours were common
