If the sequester hits, federal prosecutors will have to "let criminals go."
at most the sequester would force prosecutors to let suspects or targets go
obama said that if the sequester hits federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go
saying the sequester would mean letting criminals go is a stretch
still the idea of letting criminals go is particularly scary so we wondered whether it s accurate for obama to say that under a sequester federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go
barack obama says sequester could force prosecutors to criminals go
