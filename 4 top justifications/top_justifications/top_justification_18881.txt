In 1962, Joe Biden "worked with segregationists," Elizabeth Warren "debated as a pro-Vietnam conservative" while Bernie Sanders "organized against segregation and Vietnam war"
a facebook post said in biden worked with segregationists warren called the democratic party subversive and debated as a conservative while sanders organized against segregation and vietnam war
the post said that sanders organized against segregation and vietnam war
it states that biden worked with segregationists while warren called the democratic party subversive and debated as a conservative
subhead sanders organized against segregation and vietnam war
overall the attack is misleading about biden and warren although it correctly notes that sanders opposed segregation and the vietnam war
