"Her opponent: zero times a judge, zero rulings, zero experience on the bench."
whose narrator writes meachum off saying zero times a judge zero rulings zero experience on the bench our legal system is no place for training
patterson is correct that meachum has never been a judge
we rate her statement as trueshe has been an appellate judge i have been a civil trial attorney
meachum does deny patterson charges though writing to us i have not hidden from nor run from the fact that i have never been a judge
