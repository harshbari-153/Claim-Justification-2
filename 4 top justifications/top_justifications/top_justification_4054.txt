Says Rudy Giuliani filed for Nancy Pelosiâ€™s impeachment.
below a photo of former new york mayor rudy giuliani who is now trump s attorney is what looks like a headline giuliani files impeachment papers for pelosi on behalf of the white house
we found no evidence giuliani filed for pelosi s impeachment and unfortunately for the nearly people who signed a petition to the white house to impeach pelosi the constitution gives the house of representatives the sole power to impeach an official and it makes the senate the sole court according to a history of impeachment on the house website
no rudy giuliani didn t file for nancy pelosi s impeachment
the first line of that story reads rudy giuliani walked into the circuit court of writs today and filed articles of impeachment for nancy pelosi
above the photo are these words wow giuliani filed for her impeachment but also filed the first public formal charge of treason
