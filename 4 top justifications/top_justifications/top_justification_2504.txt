Says that like Todd Akin, all Texas Republicans in U.S. House cosponsored a bill "that attempts to distinguish between ‘forcible rape’ and other sexual assaults."
pac says like todd akin and paul ryan all texas republicans in house cosponsored bill trying to distinguish forcible rape
angle told us that he believes the texas republicans showed by cosponsoring the bill that they supported making a legal distinction between rape and forcible rape
todd akin and paul ryan that attempts to distinguish between forcible rape and other sexual assaults said a report circulated aug
but absent from the pac s claim is the fact that two texas democrats cosponsored the proposal which dampens the suggestion that republicans alone were committing to placing forcible rape into the proposal
and referred to forcible rape that word was removed from the bill during congressional deliberations
