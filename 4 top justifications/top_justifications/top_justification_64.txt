The EPA was asked about an environmental citation for the city landfill in Nashua, N.H. but "didnâ€™t know" why it was cited.
our ruling gingrich said the epa cited a nashua landfill without knowing its reason for doing so
the city of nashua recently had a dump that was cited by epa
epa did give the dump a citation
the landfill made a watch list for an outdated action but it was not cited or fined for any violation by the epa for being on the list
we ca find the records that lead to this citation and we not exactly sure what it referenced
