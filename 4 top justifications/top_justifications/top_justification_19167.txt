Referring to a destroyed brick mural of George Floyd, said itâ€™s highly unusual for a brick wall to be destroyed by lightning.
a mural of george floyd painted on the exterior brick wall of a building in toledo crumbled on july likely after the building was hit by a bolt of lightning
the mural s artist has suggested that vandals may have intentionally destroyed the george floyd memorial though this account is unconfirmed
it s possible the outer wall of the building was already unstable or that vandals tore the floyd memorial down
however we don t know for certain whether lightning caused the mural to collapse
but the notion that bricks can not be naturally damaged by lightning is wrong
