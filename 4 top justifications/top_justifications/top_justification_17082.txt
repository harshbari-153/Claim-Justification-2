"TSA WILL ACCEPT DRIVERS PRIV CARDS FOR ID AT THE AIRPORT"
i have talked to the tsa and have emails to back up the fact that tsa will accept drivers priv cards for id at the airport he wrote in one
in response to the question can i use a driver card as identification to board an airplane the document says it will be up to the tsa or the individual airport to determine whether to accept the driver card as identification
whether an air passenger shows a tsa representative a driver s license or driver card doesn t matter he said
he recently sent us a series of emails which he said verified one of his assertions about the cards that the transportation security administration will accept driver privilege cards as valid identification to board a commercial aircraft
but tsa officials the people checking passengers onto planes say otherwise
