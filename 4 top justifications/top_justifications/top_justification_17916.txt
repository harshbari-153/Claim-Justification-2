there s talk in congress now about basically confiscating your private k or ira plan and rolling it into social security to strengthen social security howell said during a nov
so let s review howell says there s talk in congress about basically confiscating your private k or ira which suggests there is serious consideration of such a proposal
howell brought up the confiscation of iras and k s then added well if congress were ever to pass a law like that i would think of the states would rear up and say i want to repeal that law and this amendment would give them the right to do that
when we asked howell for the basis of his confiscation claim he said that idea has been floating around from democrats for years
