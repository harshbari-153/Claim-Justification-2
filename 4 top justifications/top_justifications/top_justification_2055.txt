President Barack Obama "took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commissionâ€™s ideas. Not one."
john boehner says obama took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission s ideas
and what did the president do he took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission s ideas
but he did embrace a wide variety of them so to say bluntly as boehner did that obama took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission s ideas is simply not correct
we do think it s fair to say that obama has stopped short of adopting many of the commission s recommendations and he s been clear that he will not accept the package in its entirety
the obama framework supports cuts but it does not mention the specific programs recommended by the commission
