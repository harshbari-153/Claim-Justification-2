"Before this (federal health care) law was enacted, Florida parents ... were able to purchase inexpensive 'child-only' coverage for their children. The law’s 'consumer protections' have now eliminated that choice in Florida."
before this law was enacted florida parents who were laid off or who could get dependent coverage at work were able to purchase inexpensive coverage for their children scott wrote
our ruling so back to scott claim did the federal health care law eliminate an inexpensive insurance option for children in florida while elements of the law that took effect in have prompted private insurers to stop selling policies the state continues to offer a viable option for parents in the form of kidcare
the law protections have now eliminated that choice in florida and other states
in other words they could deny a child coverage based on a but the law does require them to sell a policy in the first place
did the federal health care law really eliminate all inexpensive insurance options in florida we turned to scott press office to request materials that would support the governor claim but never received a response
