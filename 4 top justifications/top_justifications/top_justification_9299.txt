Says state Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac, unlike typical taxpayers, "didnâ€™t pay taxes"
in wisconsin senate recall race democrat jessica king says gop randy hopper t pay taxes
as the accusation is made the words senator hopper didn t pay taxes appear on the screen above a footnote citing a fond du lac reporter newspaper article
king claims broadly in a tv ad that hopper unlike typical taxpayers didn t pay taxes
the ad not only accuses hopper of not paying taxes while average citizens did but suggests he did something improper or took advantage of the system
moreover there is no indication that hopper did not pay the one state income tax liability he did have
