"There is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid."
rubio said there is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under medicaid
as long as florida keeps the same amount of funding or gets an increase which is what we are working on per patient being rewarded for having done the right thing there is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under medicaid
however rubio is making too strong of a vow here that there is no reason for anyone to lose medicaid benefits
there are reasons that medicaid recipients could lose benefits if the senate bill becomes law
medicaid is the health care program for the poor funded by the federal government and the states
