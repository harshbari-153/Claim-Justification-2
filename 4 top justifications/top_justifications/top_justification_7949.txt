"Sixty-one percent of our active military are currently listed as overweight."
percent of personnel are overweight and that
which on the scale used to evaluate military personnel would be considered overweight and headed toward obese
the report does not say how much of the military is overweight according to body fat criteria
so when he says percent of our personnel are overweight we expect him to have done the homework
the percent is against a standard derived from the national heart lung and blood institute guidelines which define a bmi over as overweight and over as obese
