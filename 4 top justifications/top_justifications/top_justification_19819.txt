Rob Cornilles is a Tea Party candidate.
is rob cornilles the real tea party candidate
in tv commercials on websites and in press releases cornilles has been called the original tea party candidate or shorthanded as just tea party politician rob cornilles
for months democrats have labeled republican rob cornilles a tea in order to persuade voters that he s not as moderate as he claims
democrats say cornilles called himself the original tea party candidate but he was referring to the nature of the party not idealogy
when rob cornilles brands himself the original tea party candidate one year and then tries to align himself with the occupy movement voters are right to be skeptical about whether he has any convictions beyond getting himself elected to office
