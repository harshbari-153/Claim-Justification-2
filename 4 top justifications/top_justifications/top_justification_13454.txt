"In 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down."
government predicted that by the all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down
government predicted that by the all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down
government really predict that hemp would in the course of three decades make wood obsolete as the raw material for making paper
this was a time in our nation history when trees were abundant and i be surprised if a government agency was completely ruling them out as a source for paper
more to the point when we looked at bulletin itself we couldn t find any reference to a prediction that by the all paper would come from hemp
