Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in his budget repair bill "is showing that no stone goes unturned as he asks everyone to tighten their belts."
he is showing that no stone goes unturned as he asks everyone to tighten their belts so we can get our fiscal train back on the tracks
rnc chairman reince priebus says wisconsin gov scott walker s budget repair bill asks everyone to tighten their belts
is priebus right when he says walker is asking everyone to tighten their belts let s start with the plan itself which clearly treats some groups of public employees differently
let s return to the original statement priebus argued walker is asking everyone to tighten their belts
indeed walker has pledged not to raise taxes and has argued the changes are needed precisely so individual taxpayers do not pay more
