regulating and taxing marijuana much like we do alcohol would generate more than in revenue starting in evers tweeted april
evers tweeted regulating and taxing marijuana much like we do alcohol would generate more than in revenue starting in
under the plan the state department of revenue would issue permits to those wishing to sell recreational marijuana
in other words if legalized marijuana were to go forward it may not generate the revenue evers claimed because it may take too long to get a licensing system in place and to license and open retail outlets
while some of the administration s assumptions may result in an of tax revenues i do worry that the state may be overly optimistic about the time needed to implement the issuing of both medical and recreational marijuana retail sales licenses and the time needed to open retail outlets throughout the state
