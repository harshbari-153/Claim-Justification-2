The Democratic health care plan is a "government takeover of nearly 20 percent of our economy."
if you been following the health care debate you surely heard this line from republicans the democratic plan is a government takeover of the nation health care system
florida republican party claims democratic health care plan is government takeover
the biggest change in the democratic plan is the creation of health care exchanges that are supposed to provide coverage for americans who have trouble getting it now people who are or work for small companies
still that far short of a government takeover a phrase that suggests a complete health care system
so once again we are faced with rhetoric about the health care plan
