The law has not established whether Rhode Island public employees have property rights to their pensions.
raimondo says law has not established whether rhode island public employees have property rights to their pensions
no court he said has established property rights to rhode island state employee pensions
he said property rights to pensions could be determined by statute or judicial decision but he was unaware of either happening in rhode island
so where are we raimondo s spokeswoman cited a federal court ruling to back up her claim that public workers don t have an established property right to their pensions
so in rhode island our pension benefits are put out in statute they re not put out in a contract as they are in some states
