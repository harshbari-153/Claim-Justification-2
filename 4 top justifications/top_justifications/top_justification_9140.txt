"The Constitution doesn't allow the governor to not-spend appropriations funds."
the constitution he said does allow the governor to appropriations funds
state statutes prohibit the governor from impounding state funds meaning the governor can not simply choose to not spend money budgeted
the governor has to veto a spending proposal or accept it
though we think alexander should have cited state statutes and not the constitution he is technically right that scott is required to spend money in the state budget the way it is appropriated
he can veto future appropriations in the state budget whether the source of the funds is state money or federal
