Embryonic stem cell research is at a "dead end, with no one good example of a successful treatment."
dave weldon claims embryonic stem cell research is at a dead end with no successful treatments
with that background in mind we wanted to check weldon s claim that embryonic stem cell research has proven to be a dead end with no one good example of a successful treatment
weldon weldon the truth is research into embryonic stem cells is not only immoral but scientifically it has proven to be a dead end with no one good example of a successful treatment
weldon s second point about there being no one good successful treatment from embryonic stem cell research is accurate though scientists say it is premature and unrealistic given the field s bureaucratic constraints
our ruling weldon s synopsis of embryonic stem cell research as at a scientific dead end does not appear to be widely shared by scientists
