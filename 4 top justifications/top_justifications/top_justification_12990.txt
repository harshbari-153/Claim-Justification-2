"Bill Clinton invited him (the Rev. Wright) to the White House when he was having his personal crises."
i mean witness the fact that bill clinton invited him to the white house when he was having his personal crises
obama merely noted that clinton invited wright to the white house during a time of personal crisis and did suggest there was some close personal tie
and by pointing out the invitation obama was making clear that wright was a minister good enough at least to be among a select group of religious leaders invited to the white house for an important address by clinton
listeners hearing obama comments might have thought wright had a larger role at the white house than simply attending a prayer breakfast but obama is correct about the timing of the event
wright shaking hands with president bill clinton at the prayer breakfast
