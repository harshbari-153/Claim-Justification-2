could a gm worker afford college tuition on just two weeks work in
that s not quite right it would have taken about four weeks of work at gm not two to pay for a year at the average college in and more than that if you take account of taxes
fifty years ago when general motors was the largest employer in america the typical gm worker got paid an hour in today s dollars
