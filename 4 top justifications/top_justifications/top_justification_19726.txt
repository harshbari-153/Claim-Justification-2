"Now, I also support the Bush tax cuts. Sen. McCain voted against them originally. He now believes they should be made permanent. I'm glad he agrees they should be made permanent."
updated this post has been updated to correct the reasons mccain gave at the time for opposing tax cuts in
mccain said he supported the extensions which reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividend income because american businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy
so these tax cuts need to be made permanent
he said he would have preferred a plan that included spending cuts as well as tax cuts but added that he believes the tax cuts should now be made permanent
he points out that mccain twice voted against president bush tax changes before deciding to support them
