Says that "despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it, only 400 family (housing) units have been created" in the last 12 years through Chicagoâ€™s Affordable Requirements Ordinance.
preckwinkle said that despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it only family units have been created in the last years through chicago s affordable requirements ordinance
the affordable requirements ordinance aro is really challenged because my understanding is in the last years despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it only family units have been created
and her claim also ignores how the millions of dollars in fees collected from developers who opt out of building affordable units under the ordinance support rent subsidies and other affordable housing programs throughout the city
that doesn t go very far toward achieving the program s aim to create more affordable housing in pricier areas of the city or closing the city s affordable housing gap so there s some truth to preckwinkle s broader argument
what she didn t explain is that those funds are dispersed to promote affordable housing in a variety of ways beyond what is spent by private developers themselves to offer a share of the units they build at affordable rates
