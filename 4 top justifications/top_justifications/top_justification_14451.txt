Says Bobby Jindalâ€™s parents "used his birthright citizenship to become Americans, making him an anchor baby."
occupy democrats said bobby jindal s parents used his birthright citizenship to become americans
four months before he was born and used his birthright citizenship to become americans making him an anchor baby
the part we re is the claim that jindal s parents gained citizenship through him
we have to end birthright citizenship to stop anchor babies says republican bobby jindal whose noncitizen parents arrived in the u
why does that matter because those dates mean that jindal s birthright citizenship played no legal role in his parent s citizenship applications
