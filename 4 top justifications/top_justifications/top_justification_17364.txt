"We borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis."
yes and we borrow from the saudis too
borrows from china to buy oil from canada but what the fun in saying that
although clinton is correct that china is a big investor in treasuries but her statement is misleading because it suggests that we specifically using chinese investments to pay for saudi oilneeds the chinese and other foreign investors because our economy operates on borrowed money to meet all of its consumption needs
it clearly a stretch to say the same capital china injects into the economy when it buys treasury securities somehow winds up in the saudis pockets
