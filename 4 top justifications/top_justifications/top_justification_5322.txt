"We have more hospitals that are children’s hospitals than any other state in the union." 
during the interview batchelder noted that we ohio have more hospitals that are children s hospitals than any other state in the union
but a closer look found that the hospitals listed on those websites to which we were directed for hospitals in california and texas only represent a portion of all children s hospitals in those states
even the two children s hospital associations do not list the same number of hospitals and neither lists every children s hospital in the state
so could it really have more children s hospitals than any other state politifact ohio asked batchelder s office where the speaker got this information
in fact angela krile a spokeswoman for the ohio children s hospital association when asked about batchelder s claim said i have never heard that we have the most children s hospitals but we do have the highest rated system of children s hospitals in the country
