the fda approved thalidomide in for other conditions but not for use by pregnant women
but the post gets a key fact wrong the fda didn t approve thalidomide for pregnant women
thalidomide drug that caused disabilities wasn t for pregnant women
thalidomide was widely prescribed to pregnant mothers around the world before it was shown to cause thousands of cases of babies born with disabilities such as missing and malformed limbs
thalidomide was also fda approved says one facebook post referring to a drug first used more than six decades ago to treat morning sickness
