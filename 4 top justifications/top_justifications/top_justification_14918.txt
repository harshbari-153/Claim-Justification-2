Under President Ronald Reagan, illegal immigrants "were not pouring in like"Â they are now.
deirdre imus more illegal immigrants in now than under reagan
less people are illegally entering or trying to illegally enter the country under obama than reagan
imus said that people were not pouring in under reagan like they are now
but that still leaves the obama years with fewer new undocumented people than reagan
but with people converting from illegal to legal status simple comparisons became tricky during the last two years of reagan s term
