Says Donald Trump "cut funding to the CDC," "fired the Pandemic Response Team," "refused WHO tests" and "wasted two weeks calling this outbreak a ‘Democrat hoax.’"
the first that he cut funding to the cdc is partially accurate trump tried to cut the agency s funding but congress prevented it from happening
while it s not accurate to say that trump cut funding for the centers for disease control and prevention it is accurate to say he tried
you cut funding to the cdc you fired the pandemic response team you refused who tests you wasted weeks calling this outbreak a democrat hoax
and the fourth claim which says trump wasted two weeks calling this outbreak a democrat hoax is inaccurate the president has not called the virus itself a hoax just the democrats response to it
trump called the democratic response to a hoax
