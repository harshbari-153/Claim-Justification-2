Obama would "experiment with socialism."
palin allegation that obama wants to experiment with socialism seems designed less to inform than to inflame
barack obama offhand remark that he wants to spread the wealth around to allege obama is a socialist
and yet to joe the plumber he said it sounded like socialism
and now is not the time to experiment with socialism
and it is in that context that obama said he wanted to spread the wealth
