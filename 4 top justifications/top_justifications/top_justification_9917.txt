"Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level."
right now percent of florida students leaving high school can not read at grade level and grade level isn t that difficult proctor said in comments to the st
our ruling proctor said right now percent of florida students leaving high school can not read at grade level
we were surprised by that statistic do half of florida s high school graduates head off to college or work without reading at grade level florida s seniors aren t tested for reading skills as they don their caps and gowns
and although no one is happy about that percent figure of students reading at grade level in the grade florida has made gains
florida s fourth grade reading results were below the national average in but climbed enough by to be above the national average
