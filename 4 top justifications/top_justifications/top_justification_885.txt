"AARP endorses Biden and gives financial support to Planned Parenthood."
aarp endorses biden and gives financial support to planned parenthood a recent post says
aarp didn t endorse biden donate to planned parenthood
he shared a letter from the director of aarp minnesota to a volunteer who had been confronted by people at an event who thought aarp supports planned parenthood financially
i want to ensure you and i encourage you to share this letter as necessary that aarp does not fund and has not funded planned parenthood the letter says
in fact aarp has a policy against endorsing or appearing to endorse political parties government officials or candidates for office
