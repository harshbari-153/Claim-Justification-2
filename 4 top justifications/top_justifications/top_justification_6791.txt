Says President Donald Trump implemented "a travel ban that just didn't work, 400,000 people got in from those countries that were subject to the restrictions."
murphy said trump implemented a travel ban that just did work people got in from those countries that were subject to the restrictions
effectively after the travel ban a travel ban that just did work people got in from those countries that were subject to the restrictions after that the president just gave up
president donald trump often credits restrictions he imposed on travel from china with saving american lives
that total included a smaller number of travelers whose direct flights occurred after trump imposed travel restrictions on china starting feb
we won t weigh in on whether the travel ban just didn t work as murphy claimed
