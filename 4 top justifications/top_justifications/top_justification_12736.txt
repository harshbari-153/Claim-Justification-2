During the Nixon Watergate investigation, "out of courtesy, the FBI started reporting to the Department of Justice. But there was nothing official."
trump said out of courtesy the fbi started reporting to the department of justice in the course of the watergate investigation and that there was nothing official
when nixon came along inaudible was pretty brutal and out of courtesy the fbi started reporting to the department of justice
but trump made the broad assertion that there was nothing official that compelled the fbi to report to the justice department
the director of the fbi reports to the attorney general and it was not a matter of courtesy during watergate to report to the department of justice rather standard operating procedure he said
during watergate the fbi reported to the attorney general s office because that is what it was created to do
