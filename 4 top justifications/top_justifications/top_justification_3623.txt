"Never once did they (House Republicans) actually cut spending or reduce the state budget. Even when they cut taxes in 2005, they increased spending. Â They never paid for their tax cuts."
but budish isn t totally correct when he says that the republicans never paid for the tax cuts contained in the state budget
never once did they actually cut spending or reduce the state budget
at a news conference budish got uncharacteristically lathered up saying that democrats have made the cuts that republicans wouldn t in slicing almost billion from the current
the closest thing to a cut under republican control was the budget which went up only slightly but included a percent income tax reduction spread over five years which is the tax cut budish is referring to in his comment
they never paid for their tax cuts
