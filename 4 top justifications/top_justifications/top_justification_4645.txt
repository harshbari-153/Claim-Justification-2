"Ninety percent of the topsoil has inadequate moisture to grow crops."
ninety percent of the topsoil has inadequate moisture to grow crops kasich said
does that mean we have inadequate soil moisture to grow a normal crop absolutely
the report said that topsoil moisture was rated at percent very short percent short percent adequate and zero percent surplus
so where does that leave our governor as we harvest our crop of facts while an argument could be made that the weekly crop weather report shows only that percent of the ohio topsoil is inadequate to grow normal crops we think it s clear that s what kasich meant in his remarks even though he did use the word normal
ohio gov john kasich says the drought has left percent of the state s topsoil too dry for crops
