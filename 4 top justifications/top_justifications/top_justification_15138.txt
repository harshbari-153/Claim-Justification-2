Says a Republican-drawn map of proposed U.S. House districts for Texas "gerrymanders more than nine million Latinos in Texas to make sure that we have no more electoral opportunity than we did in 1991."
nina perales vice president of litigation for the mexican american legal defense and educational fund said in a may press release that the map just unveiled by republican legislators gerrymanders more than nine million latinos in texas to make sure that we have no more electoral opportunity than we did in
not so perales said because it s offset by redraws of san antonio s district and the district stretching west from san antonio that dilute latino voting power
perales told us latino voters could elect the candidate of their choice in the district
he said too that such residents aren t always geographically concentrated and latino voter registration and turnout tends to run low in part because there are more latino than in other subgroups
now the flashback lawmakers in designed two of three added house districts as opportunity districts giving latino voters a good shot at electing candidates of their choice
