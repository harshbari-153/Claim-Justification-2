Says Barack Obama "never worked in the private sector" before he was elected president.
romney says barack obama has no private sector experience
as politifact reported two years ago when joe scarborough falsely asserted that obama had never received a paycheck from a business the president does in fact have some experience outside of government albeit not in the fortune world
the ruling obama may not have the corporate chops of romney but he s worked in several jobs in the private sector and had management experience
but obama s work experience or lack thereof is ground and he clearly has worked outside of government
some of the relevant jobs in obama s work history include a stint in as a research assistant at business international corp
