If Florida had not taken the stimulus, it "would have led to the firing of 20,000 teachers."
crist said that if florida had not taken the stimulus it would have led to the firing of teachers
in addition it s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of teachers who would have been laid off statewide since districts would have had discretion in how to handle budget cutting and may have had other options to reduce spending beyond laying off teachers
is it true that by taking federal stimulus dollars crist saved teachers from being laid off
at the other extreme some districts could have laid off more expensive teachers who were close to retirement and that could have lowered the number
but it s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of teachers who would have been laid off without the federal infusion of money because we can t predict how each district would have handled their own budgets
