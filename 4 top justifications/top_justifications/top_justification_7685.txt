Says Paul Ryan said that 22 million Americans "choose to be poor, so it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy."
com ran under the headline paul ryan million americans choose to be poor so it s their own problem if they can t afford to be healthy
ryan did discuss how the senate s proposed legislation would affect poor people but he never said million people choose to be poor
being rich or poor is a matter of choice that s all there is to it ryan is quoted
so let me ask you this brian if million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they re going to be healthy if they choose to be poor then it s their own problem if they can t afford to be healthy
a story that claimed house speaker paul ryan said millions of people have willingly elected to be impoverished is fake news
