Obama "said (the individual mandate) wasn't a tax."
did obama say the individual mandate wasn t a tax given how unpopular taxes are it s understandable why obama would not trumpet the notion that the mandate was a tax
but has he said it was not a tax we could find only one example after obama was president in which he or a top aide explicitly stated that the mandate wasn t a tax
our ruling palin is correct that obama said the individual mandate was a tax
sarah palin says barack obama once said the individual mandate was a tax
sliced up into brief sound bites the between stephanopoulos offers some clear evidence of obama arguing that the mandate is not a tax most obviously when he says that the mandate is absolutely not a tax increase
