Photo shows "the aftermath of the ‘CHOP’ Zone’ in Seattle, WA. July 2020."
photo on the left the aftermath of the chop zone in seattle wa
the headline how a photo of trash in greenpoint became a photo of seattle s autonomous zone
july reads the description of an image showing a street littered with debris
we did a reverse image search for the photo that the facebook post says is the chop zone referring to the capitol hill occupied protest which was also known as the capitol hill autonomous zone or chaz
regardless this facebook post misuses a photo of the aftermath of a trash fire in brooklyn to claim that seattle protesters were responsible for the mess
