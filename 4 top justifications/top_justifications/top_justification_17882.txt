Derek Chauvinâ€™s attorney said that space aliens "inhabited the body of Derek Chauvin and caused this death."
fanciful space aliens flew in inhabited the body of derek chauvin and caused this death
a tiktok video went viral claiming that chauvin s defense attorney said that space aliens inhabited chauvin s body and caused floyd s death
the sentence was captured in a tiktok video space aliens flew in inhabited the body of derek chauvin and caused this death
no derek chauvin s lawyer didn t say space aliens invaded his body
it doesn t mean beyond all possibility of doubt because i suppose space aliens may have been inhabiting his body but that s obviously fanciful and capricious
