"The majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules."
well we all know that the majority of the people that are coming to arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules brewer said
but that a much more limited claim than what she initially said that the majority of the people that are coming to arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules
so we talked to experts and looked over statistical data to see whether brewer was justified in claiming that the majority of the people that are coming to arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules
brewer added i believe today and in the circumstances that we are facing that the majority of the illegal trespassers that are coming in the state of arizona are under the direction and control of organized drug cartels and they are bringing drugs in
while the source she eventually cited the los angeles times says that sometimes smugglers loaded up their human cargo with backpacks full of marijuana the article does back up her assertion that that the majority of illegal immigrants carry drugs into the country
