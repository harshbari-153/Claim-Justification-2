Says "Oregon is one of only three states that allow the use of gillnets on inland waters."
currently oregon is one of only three states that allow the use of gillnets on inland waters reads a may press release by the stop gillnetting now campaign
oregon the revised statement reads is one of only a few states left that allows the use of commercial gillnets on rivers and streams
is oregon one of three states to allow commercial gillnetting
and they say oregon is in the minority when it comes to gillnets
is oregon truly that rare and if so why or were we being snookered by campaign politicking an administrator with oregon s salmon for all a group that represents commercial gillnetters said the number of states that allow commercial gillnetting is much higher which means oregon is not so
