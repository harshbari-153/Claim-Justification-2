"US Capitol raided 2/2/21."
capitol a feb
no the capitol wasn t raided on
youtube video makes the claim that it shows the building being raided that night
police officers stood at attention on each side of the plaza as two officers marched a small wooden box and a folded american flag to the rotunda the washington post reported
but there s no evidence to support that claim and it appears that the vehicles with flashing lights that can be seen slowly approaching the capitol are part of the motorcade that brought the remains of a capitol police officer to lie in honor in the capitol rotunda
