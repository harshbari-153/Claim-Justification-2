Paula Deen supported and campaigned for Barack Obama.
and for what it s worth deen supported and campaigned for barack obama
for deen s description the magazine says she campaigned for obama back in and invited first lady michelle obama to cook with her on an episode of paula s party
to counter critics claiming that deen is racist political commentators have noted her supposed support of president barack obama
deen did have michelle obama on her show for a segment in september
so elder s claim that deen campaigned for and supported obama falls like a biscuit with no baking powder
