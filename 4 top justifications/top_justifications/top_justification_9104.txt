"Municipalities are now required to have two or more polling locations opened 24-hours a day, two weeks before any election."
it then claims sb levels the playing field since municipalities are now required to have two or more polling locations opened a day two weeks before any election
in an email to constituents ott said a bill passed by republicans levels the field for because municipalities are now required to have two or more polling locations opened a day two weeks before any election
so counter to what ott s email claimed that doesn t necessarily mean polling places will be operating hours a day or even that a given municipality will offer early voting at all
it set a maximum time period for early voting
the item noted that in past elections large cities including milwaukee madison and green bay offered early voting for up to six weeks before election day far longer than many smaller municipalities
