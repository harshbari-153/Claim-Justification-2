Minnesota imposed an Islamic anti-blasphemy law.
nevertheless fake news sites like political mayhem claim minnesota recently passed an islamic law dressed up to look like a municipal hate crime hotline
third even if this hotline were law it s not laws are unenforceable in the united states because blasphemy is considered protected speech under the constitution
to suss out the raison d etre of this fake news article look no further than its inflammatory headline which reads state of minnesota has just handed over full control to muslims so they can take down infidels
defining blasphemy is easy enough in legal terms it s any oral or written reproach maliciously cast upon god his name attributes or religion
but it strains credulity beyond the breaking point to believe a hate crime hotline set up june by the city of minneapolis is actually an islamic law
