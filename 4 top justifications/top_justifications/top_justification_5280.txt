"Up until two weeks ago, John McCain was a leading proponent of amnesty. Now with me challenging him, suddenly he has changed."
up until two weeks ago john mccain was a leading proponent of amnesty
since then mccain rhetoric on the issue has shifted
mccain has even acknowledged the change of heart telling on april that i changed my mind over a year ago as you know
but there is nothing to substantiate hayworth claim that up until two weeks ago john mccain was a leading proponent of amnesty
immigration reform has many components and we found mccain has changed his position on at least one of them
