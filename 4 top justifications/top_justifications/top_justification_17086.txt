The Bush administration "pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead."
so to sum up krugman said the bush administration pulled the troops out of afghanistan pulled the resources away because they wanted to invade iraq instead
we were interested in krugman statement that the bush administration pulled the troops out of afghanistan pulled the resources away because they wanted to invade iraq instead
so krugman said that the bush administration pulled the troops out of afghanistan eight years ago but we could not document any declines until the surge in iraq in
and experts said that key assets including intelligence operations and special forces units were pulled away from afghanistan for the iraq invasion
i surprised that people are pointing out that basically the decision to abandon afghanistan was taken eight years ago right eight years ago when the taliban was on the run when it might have been possible to really use the momentum to change this that when the bush administration pulled the troops out of afghanistan pulled the resources away because they wanted to invade iraq instead
