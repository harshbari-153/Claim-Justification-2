"We haven't yet taken out a negative ad."
we not knocking use of a negative ad here we knocking her decision to use a negative ad and then deny that she did
but i would say that when he made the remarks about not going dirty i do want to point out that we have yet taken out a negative ad
so when said that we have yet taken out a negative ad she was wrong and had been wrong for at least two full days
a full day before reference to not taking out negative ads in the debate
when we saw the clip replayed on abc this week with christiane amanpour we were struck by comment that we have yet taken out a negative ad given that we had spent the better part of a day dissecting an ad from that all but portrayed coons as the protagonist in a horror movie
