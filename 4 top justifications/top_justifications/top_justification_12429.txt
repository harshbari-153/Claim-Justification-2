"Black Lives Matter, who are attacking law enforcement officers" -- Barack Obama "had them to the White House."
and frankly eric you know black lives matter who are attacking law enforcement officers he obama had them to the white house
in saying obama is not shutting down violence duffy claimed black lives matter who are attacking law enforcement officers obama had them to the white house
and obama while defending black lives matter has condemned attacks on police officers
so duffy is saying that obama in not shutting down violence invited members of black lives matter to the white house even though members of the group are attacking law enforcement officers
moreover obama while defending the black lives matter movement has condemned those who advocate violence
