"Top CEOs (are) making 300 times the average worker."
kennedy said top ceos are making times the average worker
do ceos make times the average worker as joe kennedy said
we choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices he said and brave enough to admit that top ceos making times the average worker is not right
bloomberg analyzed income data and found ceos made times more than the income paid to average workers
the liberal economic policy institute said ceos make either or times that of average employees depending on how you measure stock options
