The RESTORE Act started as an "effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration" but now "could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast."
rubio said the restore act started as an effort to dedicate as much bp fine money as possible towards gulf coast restoration but now could steer money to places like the great lakes and west coast
what started as a genuine bipartisan effort to dedicate as much bp fine money as possible towards gulf coast restoration has now turned into a raw deal that increases taxes creates a new environmental bureaucracy and could steer money to places like the great lakes and west coast that had nothing to do with the oil spill rubio said
some money from the restore act could go to the great lakes and the west coast but the bulk of the money particularly the fines themselves would still go to the gulf coast
the congressional budget office estimated that the restore act could fund an endowment of million by for both the ocean endowment and the gulf of mexico
this is no longer a gulf coast restoration bill it s a federal power grab that exploits the bp spill to pay for special interest projects driven by the usual in it for me washington mentality he said
