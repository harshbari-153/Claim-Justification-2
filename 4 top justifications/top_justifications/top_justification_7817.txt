"This rule could prevent children under 18 from using such tools as a power screwdriver, a milking machine or something as simple as a wheelbarrow on the family farm . . . "
so no matter the government rules if a parent with some ownership in the farm tells a child to crank up the milking machine there s nothing to prohibit it
our ruling the proposed rules could limit the kinds of potentially dangerous work children might perform on family farms owned by someone else s family
first we asked alexander s office specifically for support for his contention that the bill would prevent children from using a power screwdriver or wheelbarrows
so we decided to look at whether the proposed rules would prohibit some kid under from carting a load of alfalfa to the manger or tightening up a license plate on a pickup before heading out on the blacktop
the department of labor told us the rules would not in fact prevent their use by children working on a farm
