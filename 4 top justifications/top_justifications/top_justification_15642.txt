Says the Senate Intelligence Committee has held 10 public hearings this year, "more than double that held by the committee in any recent year."
the house intelligence committee has held four hearings this year
senate records show that the senate intelligence committee met in public five or fewer times in nearly every year of the obama administration
two major investigations the committee wrapped up in and were conducted with zero public hearings although they both ended with a partial report being made public
he said sessions testimony was the public hearing his committee has had already in more than double that held by the committee in any recent year
burr is right and the committee has also been holding more public hearings now than its house counterpart as well as more than it did during past investigations into topics like cia torture intelligence failures leading up to the iraq war and intelligence failures before
