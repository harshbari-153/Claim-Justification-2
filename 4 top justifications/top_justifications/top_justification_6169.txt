It is "the Department of Homeland Security's view that returning military veterans and gun owners are likely to commit terrorist acts."
i am disturbed and personally offended by the department of homeland security view that returning military veterans and gun owners are likely to commit terrorist acts he said
this brings us back to bilirakis claim that dhs thinks that returning military veterans and gun owners are likely to commit terrorist acts
a few sections down the report says the possible passage of new restrictions on firearms and the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks
conservative groups have been sounding an alarm about a leaked report from the department of homeland security they say portrays veterans and gun owners as likely terrorists
the report said that extremists would try to recruit veterans and that they would try to use gun control legislation as a radicalization tool
