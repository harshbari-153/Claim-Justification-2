"There's never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens."
there never been a direct supreme court case on people who were here illegally whether or not their kids are citizens
paul said there never been a direct supreme court case on people who were here illegally whether or not their kids are citizens
we wondered whether paul is right that there never been a direct supreme court case on people who were here illegally whether or not their kids are citizens
the supreme court has not ruled explicitly on a citizenship case involving children born in the united states to undocumented parents
in the debate paul essentially argued that because the supreme court case didn t directly address birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants that issue remains to be fully adjudicated
