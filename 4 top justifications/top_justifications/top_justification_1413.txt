Says the "NC appeals court" acknowledged the state’s election maps "are skewed," but didn’t block them because they are "partisan hacks."
butler said the nc appeals court confirmed the state s election maps are skewed but didn t block them because they are partisan hacks
so the nc appeals court and i paraphrase yeah it is despicable the maps are skewed citizens will be deprived of their vote we agree with the experts democracy hangs in the balance yada yada but you know we are partisan hacks so we gon na live with it
while the judges didn t call the maps despicable they did on page express disdain for having to deal with issues that potentially lead to results incompatible with democratic principles and subject our state to ridicule
the judges did state as fact in their ruling that the congressional map is the product of intentional partisan redistricting while calling the state house and senate plans extreme outliers
butler said the judges are partisan hacks
