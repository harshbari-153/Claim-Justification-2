"The CDC has removed the ‘Covid-19 Pandemic’ and replaced it with ‘Covid-19 Outbreak’ on their website. It was never a pandemic."
the cdc has removed the pandemic and replaced it with outbreak on their website one facebook post says
a facebook post claims the cdc has removed the pandemic and replaced it with outbreak on their website
but there is no evidence the cdc removed the word pandemic to replace it with outbreak
no the cdc hasn t stopped calling a pandemic
the post also incorrectly asserts that was never a pandemic
