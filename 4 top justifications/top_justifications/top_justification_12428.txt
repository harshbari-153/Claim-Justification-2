Says Joe Biden "made it clear..No More Coal Fired Power Plants!! So, No More Coal!! Wake Up WV, PA,OH, KY"
the facebook post claimed that biden said no more power plants so no more coal
no more coal fired power plants so no more coal wake up wv pa oh ky reads one facebook user s text post
biden s s going to build another coal plant in context
it s not the first time biden has mischaracterized his own stance on fossil fuels
but biden s climate plan acknowledges existing coal plants as part of the country s energy portfolio
