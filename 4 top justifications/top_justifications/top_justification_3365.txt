Obamacare "is not a popular law."
ryan said obamacare is not a popular law
this health care law is not a popular law
so it s fair to say that if the question is about obamacare overall more americans have a negative view than a positive one
in april politifact national gave a mostly true to this claim one thing that is much more unpopular than the affordable care act is repealing the affordable care act
with barack obama or hillary clinton in the white house of course the affordable care act wasn t going anywhere
