An electromagnetic radiation detector can detect radiation from someoneâ€™s COVID-19 vaccination.
a facebook video attempts to show that putting an electromagnetic radiation detector near someone s vaccination site shows that those who are vaccinated give off high amounts of electromagnetic radiation
no getting a vaccine won t expose you to high amounts of electromagnetic radiation
he also specified that the vaccines would not impact the amount of someone s radiation
politifact found the electromagnetic radiation tester that appears to be used in the video
all human bodies give off some level of radiation but experts say that the video is misleading because there is nothing in the vaccines that could impact the amount of radiation a person gives off
