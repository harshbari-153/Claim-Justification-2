John McCain "opposed legislation to fund levees and flood control programs, which he considers pork."
mccain had opposed legislation to fund levees and flood control programs which he considers pork
that too gives credence to obama charge that mccain is categorically opposed to levee and flood control efforts
obama was referring to mccain opposition to a water resources bill that congress debated last year that would have authorized
john mccain has a reputation as a loud critic of political pork especially the projects that get stuffed into congress periodic water bills
mccain was out front in urging the senate to reject the water resources bill and he has been consistent in branding the government process for funding those projects to be an exercise in spending
