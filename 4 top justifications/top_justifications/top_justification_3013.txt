Says "if the (Iran nuclear) deal gets rejected, they still get" $150 billion.
trump said of iran that if the nuclear deal gets rejected they still get billion
does iran actually get billion from this deal and if congress rejects the deal does iran still get the money let s take one question at a time
if the deal gets rejected they still get all of this money
experts told us that even if congress rejected the nuclear deal thus maintaining current u
so even if the total assets are billion it s unlikely that that much will actually be available to iran when sanctions are lifted
