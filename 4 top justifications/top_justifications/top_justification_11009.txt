"There were fewer civilian casualties in Cambodia than there have been from American drone attacks."
and i bet if one did an honest account there were fewer civilian casualties in cambodia than there have been from american drone attacks
we examined whether the cambodian bombings killed fewer civilians than drones
kissinger said that he thought that an honest accounting would show that there were fewer civilian casualties from america s bombing campaign in cambodia than from drone attacks today
while the data lack precision in both cases we see barely over civilian deaths due to drones and at least civilian deaths due to american bombs in cambodia and the potential for many many more
these figures represent a high estimate for drone deaths and the lowest guess for the cambodian bombing in which half a million tons of bombs fell on the country over a span of four years
