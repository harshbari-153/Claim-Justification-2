Veterans should vote Republican "because the damn Democrats blocked the VA Healthcare bill again."
i urge all veterans to vote republican this november because the damn democrats blocked the va healthcare bill again james hauser asserts in an message posted oct
to make the claim that democrats blocked the va healthcare bill strikes us a meme malpractice
facebook meme miscounts votes in claim democrats blocked improvements to va health system
one of donald trump campaign pledges was to improve healthcare for veterans
the problem has long been recognized although we rated trump claim that thousands of veterans were dying because they could get treatment fast enough as half true
