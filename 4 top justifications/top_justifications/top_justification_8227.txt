"Sixty-five percent of the Iraqi people now say it's okay to shoot an American soldier."
bill richardson had a startling way to support his view that the situation in iraq is not improving what i saying also is that look at this statistic percent of the iraqi people now say it okay to shoot an american soldier
he adds it generally a fair point to say iraqis are unhappy with the american presence in iraq
it not at all clear that the same number would have said it is acceptable if people had been asked is it okay to shoot an american soldier so richardson is at least casting the response in more dramatic terms than the question interviewers asked
at the same time the poll clearly suggests that about half of the iraqi people consider attacks on coalition forces acceptable
the question says geer is whether on coalition forces equates to an american soldier which of course it does
