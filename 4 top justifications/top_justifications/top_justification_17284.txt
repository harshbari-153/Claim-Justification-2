Says former Democratic Sen. Harry Reid has an outlaw horse thief ancestor and Reidâ€™s office offered a spin-job biography about the man.
no harry reid doesn t have a horse thief ancestor named remus reid
harry reid is simply one of many political figures to be implicated in this bogus ancestry spin job
a wild tale about a horse thief ancestor of former democratic sen
all versions of this claim end with the politician s office in this case harry reid s office issuing a statement to wallman that attempts to spin the of the supposedly criminal uncle into something more legitimate calling the ancestor a famous cowboy who passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed
the post claims a genealogy researcher named judy wallman was working on her family tree when she found that the former senator from nevada has a uncle remus reid who was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in montana in and whom wallman also shared as an ancestor
