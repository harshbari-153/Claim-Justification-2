Says Dontre Hamilton, who was killed during a confrontation with a Milwaukee police officer, was "unarmed."
clinton said hamilton who was killed during a confrontation with milwaukee police officer christopher manney was unarmed
hamilton was shot to death april after police were called to red arrow park in downtown milwaukee
moments before he was shot to death by the officer hamilton had taken the officer s baton and struck the officer with it
in that sense hamilton was armed only after he had been struck
but hamilton who was mentally ill had no weapon when he was rousted by the officer shortly after two other officers had allowed hamilton to continue sleeping in a park
