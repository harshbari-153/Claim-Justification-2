"Right now every single one of the (oil) companies here today and dozens of others are drilling for free in the Gulf of Mexico on leases that will cost American taxpayers more than $50 billion in lost royalties."
one of the claims markey made was that right now every single one of the companies here today and dozens of others are drilling for free in the gulf of mexico on leases that will cost american taxpayers more than billion in lost royalties
one of those issues has to do with how much oil companies are paying the federal government for the right to drill offshore
in reality the companies pay tens of millions of dollars a year just to extract oil in the gulf alone
we think a reasonable person hearing his statement but unaware of the controversy over the lease language would come away thinking that no oil company pays a dime for anything it pumps out of the gulf
the ongoing oil spill in the gulf of mexico has focused attention on a wide range of problems with the nation regulation of how oil and other natural resources are extracted
