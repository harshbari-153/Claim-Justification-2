"The last time Republicans held hostage a resolution to ensure that our countryâ€™s bills were paid cost us more than $1 billion in added interest and slowed the economic recovery."
our ruling doggett said the last time republicans held hostage a resolution to ensure that our country s bills were paid cost us more than billion in added interest and slowed the economic recovery
his punch line the last time republicans held hostage a resolution to ensure that our country s bills were paid cost us more than billion in added interest and slowed the economic recovery
that year republicans in congress and the obama administration unsuccessfully hunted a agreement reducing the debt and budget deficits
finally were republicans to blame
and while it seems to us that republican desires for spending cuts greatly explain the delayed action it s also correct that gop leaders wanted the ceiling raised while some house democrats voted against the measure raising the ceiling
