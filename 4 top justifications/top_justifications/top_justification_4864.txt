"Romneycare was model for Obamacare."
rick perry says romneycare was model for obamacare
during the debate perrytruthteam sent out a familiar message romneycare was model for obamacare
however the politico story also says that it is well known that obama s health care plan was in part modeled after romney s reforms
perry posted an online video linking the health care plan that mitt romney the former governor of massachusetts signed in for his state dubbed romneycare by critics and the one that president barack obama signed in for the country dubbed obamacare by critics
although the federal law isn t an exact replica of the one in massachusetts the plan signed by romney certainly served as a model
