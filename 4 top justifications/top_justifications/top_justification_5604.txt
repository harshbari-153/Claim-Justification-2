"These 60 acres (the Atlanta Braves want to build a stadium on) have produced zero SPLOST money for parks and recreation, have produced zero money for education."
to sum up loud said the acres the atlanta braves are considering as part of a stadium development have produced no splost money for parks and recreation and zero money for education
these acres have produced zero splost money for parks and recreation have produced zero money for education said john loud who owns loud security based in cobb
as for whether the property has produced zero money for education that s a more complicated element to loud s claim
the team plans to use acres for the stadium and development the braves say
there s no commerce there so there s no sales tax generated said loud who believes the county will collect millions of dollars annually from the land if it is developed by the braves
