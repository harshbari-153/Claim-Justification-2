Says she does the jobs of state auditor, secretary of state and lieutenant governor "for less than the price of one of them" in Washington state.
meanwhile washington pays its state auditor a year its lieutenant governor and its secretary of state
i basically do all three of those jobs for less than the price of one of them
she selects the chief auditor she is typically seen as the de facto lieutenant governor and of course she is oregon s secretary of state
you ll find that she doesn t exactly do in oregon what the lieutenant governor does in washington other than potentially filling in for the governor
more recently she talked about what a steal oregon s secretary of state position is noting that it s basically three jobs in one
