"No city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted (clean energy) targets more ambitious in scale."
no city in the state no state in this nation for that matter the entire world has adopted targets more ambitious in scale de león said in a speech at the griffith observatory in los angeles
senate leader kevin de león says no city in the state no state in this nation for that matter the entire world has adopted clean energy targets more ambitious in scale
if we define ambitious as setting high goals and being able to follow through on them then california clearly has some of the strongest clean energy initiatives in the country and on the planet
we decided to de león s claim that no one else has more ambitious clean energy targets than california with a focus on renewable energy
more difficult to answer is the question about whether california s clean energy goals are the most ambitious globally
