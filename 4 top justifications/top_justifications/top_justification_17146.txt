Says Barack Obama tweeted, "Has anyone checked to make sure Donald Trump doesnâ€™t have a Russian birth certificate?"
but has anyone checked to make sure donald trump doesn t have a russian birth certificate
no obama didn t tweet that trump might have russian birth certificate
the fake tweet referencing trump s birth certificate does not appear on obama s twitter page nor does it appear on archived versions of it
a fabricated tweet makes it look as though former president barack obama suggested publicly that his successor donald trump was born in russia
the tweet alludes to the birther conspiracy theory that trump promoted for years about obama which falsely claimed that obama was born in kenya and ineligible to be president
