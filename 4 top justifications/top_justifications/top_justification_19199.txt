"Medical-grade marijuana alone will not get that patient ‘high,’ no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant."
a representative of united for care said marijuana alone will not get that patient high no matter what level of thc cbd or any other compound is found in the plant
what is also important to know is that although some debilitated patients may require higher levels of thc than others based on their specific medical condition marijuana alone will not get that patient high no matter what level of thc cbd or any other compound is found in the plant mccray wrote
it sounded peculiar to us to say that medical marijuana can t get you high regardless of the chemical content
while there are strains of cannabis that are already being used as treatments for some conditions it s not accurate to say that no form of medical marijuana will get you high
essentially their argument is one of semantics medical marijuana patients won t be getting stoned they ll be using medication under the supervision of a doctor as a form of treatment
