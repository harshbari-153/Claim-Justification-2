a viral video of an unruly airline passenger railing at a flight attendant seems perfectly plausible since similar scenes have unfolded so many times during the pandemic
in the video a maskless winter tells an actress portraying a flight attendant that she won t sit in her assigned seat since it s not safe here and that her seatmate should be moved because he does not have a vaccine card
the video gives the appearance of having been filmed by a bystander during a real event and the caption says round of applaud sic to the flight crew with an emoji of hands clapping
