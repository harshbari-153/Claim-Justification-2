"You can't pass a budget in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes."
senate who said we do not need to bring a budget to the floor this year
so lew is clearly wrong to say that you ca pass a budget in the senate of the united states without votes
so unless republicans are willing to work with democrats in the senate harry reid is not going to be able to get a budget passed
so a simple majority not votes is all that s required to pass a budget resolution
you ca pass a budget in the senate of the united states without votes and you ca get votes without bipartisan support
