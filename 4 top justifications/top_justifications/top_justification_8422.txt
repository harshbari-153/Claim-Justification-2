Says Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke has "deputies collecting overtime while sitting passively in chairs watching courthouse security personnel work."
chisholm said clarke has deputies collecting overtime while sitting passively in chairs watching courthouse security personnel work
do deputies get paid overtime to sit at courthouse security checkpoints and watch
among other things chisholm said the sheriff office was running a budget deficit partly because clarke has deputies collecting overtime while sitting passively in chairs watching courthouse security personnel work
our colleagues who regularly visit the courthouse told us the same usually they see deputies merely observing but occasionally actively working a checkpoint
there s no dispute that part of the sheriff s overtime budget pays deputies to work security checkpoints at the courthouse complex
