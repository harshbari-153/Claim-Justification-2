"Republicans recently passed a bill to eliminate early voting on Sunday" in Georgia
schumer said that republicans recently passed a bill to eliminate early voting on sunday in georgia
republicans recently passed a bill to eliminate early voting on sunday a day when many churchgoing african americans participate in voter drives known as souls to the polls schumer said during a march senate committee hearing on a federal voting rights bill
republicans initially proposed getting rid of sunday early voting but by the time of schumer s remarks the state house had passed a bill that allowed for one sunday of voting
schumer s statement provides a misleading impression that georgia republicans completely got rid of sunday voting
the early voting period under georgia law previously ended the friday before election day so unlike in some states georgia already disallowed early voting on the last sunday before election day
