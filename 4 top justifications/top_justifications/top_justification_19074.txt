Nazi Germany’s Hermann Göring worked to "defund and eliminate the police departments so that they would not interfere with his Brown Shirts."
a june post from an instagram account called republican army claims that after adolf hitler appointed hermann göring as interior minister in göring worked to defund and eliminate the police departments so that they would not interfere with his brown shirts
so the nazis did defund and eliminate police unions in but they certainly did not defund and eliminate police departments
an instagram post claims that nazi s defunded and eliminated police departments in germany
göring used his position to nazify the prussian police and establish the gestapo
it would thus simply have made no sense for the nazis to defund or eliminate police departments as they already had full control over them
