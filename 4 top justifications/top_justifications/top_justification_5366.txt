she gave a statement to the northeast times this week saying it is shocking to me that police commissioner richard ross and mayor jim kenney allowed this illegal occupation to go on for hours without taking any action to enforce the law and i question whether the police department has been ordered to stand down when it comes to addressing this black lives matter action
we zeroed in on the phrase illegal occupation
did the blm protesters who did not have a permit commit an illegal act outside officer ryan pownall s home
asked why white believed the protesters were illegally occupying the area spokesperson david foster told politifact pa it was because they lacked a permit and harassed the neighbors
however a police vehicle was parked in the middle of the street for some time
