Says the Clintons "burst through their own self-pronounced guidelines" by accepting foreign donations. "There is a clip of Bill Clinton saying we're not going to take foreign donations."
there is a clip of bill clinton saying we not going to take foreign donations because if somebody had business before the state department there would be an appearance of impropriety scarborough said
scarborough is right that there a video clip of clinton dicussing foreign donations but as this will show he misleads viewers by saying it a sign the clintons burst through their guidelines of taking foreign donations
in short there are serious questions about how the clinton foundation reported foreign government donations
as far as the other clinton programs and initiatives the clintons were permitted to collect donations from foreign governments
clinton said the clinton global initiative didn t take donations from foreign entities while hillary clinton was secretary of state because it opens questions of conflicts of interest
