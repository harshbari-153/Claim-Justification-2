"Democrats like to blame Republicans on (low vaccination rates). Well, the biggest group in most states are African Americans who have not been vaccinated. The last time I checked, over 90% of them vote for Democrats."
in an attempt to blame vaccine hesitancy on democrats patrick said on fox news that the biggest group of unvaccinated people in most states is african americans
well the biggest group in most states are african americans who have not been vaccinated
there a clear difference between what patrick said on fox news that african americans are the biggest group of unvaccinated people and what he said in response to backlash that black populations have the lowest rates of vaccination
but his revised statement that vaccination rates among the black population lag behind that of other racial groups is correct
according to cdc data and several other sources when comparing vaccination rates in texas and several other states the african american community has the lowest rate of vaccination when compared to latinos whites and asians
