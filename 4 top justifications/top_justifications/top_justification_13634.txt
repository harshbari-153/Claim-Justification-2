On immigration, "the president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldn't do what he eventually did."
in a nutshell the majority of the examples are of obama saying he did not have power to do more on immigration without congress
boehner claim is obama said he couldn t do what he eventually did
but also included on boehner s list of are quotes where obama was either suggesting his executive powers did not have hard limits or was silent on his executive power on immigration
bush that interpret laws but he did not bring up immigration
obama replied that as the head of the executive branch there s a limit to what i can we re still going to ultimately have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally as in parents deported
