west has raised million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins end social security and medicare and give corporations free reign
for this we wanted to explore whether west has raised million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins end social security and medicare and give corporations free reign
klein fundraising said west has raised million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins end social security and medicare and give corporations free reign
note klein did say that west would ruin florida beaches end social security and medicare and give corporations free rein he said that million in donations to west came from donors who held those views
clearly west has taken money from at least a few donors that have either been sympathetic to bp in favor of massive cuts to social security and medicare or affiliated with corporations that have been accused of wrongdoing
