"All (Maryland) crabs are born in Virginia."
mcauliffe said all maryland crabs are born in virginia
terry mcauliffe says all maryland crabs are born in virginia
if anyone from maryland is listening i want to make this perfectly clear all the crabs are born here in virginia and they end up because of the current being taken to maryland
all this information seemed to confirm the governor s statement but did not specifically state that all bay crabs are born in virginia
there are however a small number of crabs that are born outside of the chesapeake in maryland coastal waters
