Under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty "enrichment has been limited to basically the weapons states."
cheney said that a key piece of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty is that only states can have enrichment programs
given that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty or npt was designed in part to allow countries to pursue the peaceful use of atomic energy cheney s claim struck us as dubious
however under no reading does the treaty limit enrichment to states
ratified by the united states in the treaty s first two articles target the spread of nuclear weapons
