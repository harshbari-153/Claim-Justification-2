Under a House Republican appropriations bill, "6 million seniors are deprived of meals."
we ll focus on whether million seniors would in fact be denied meals if republican budget plans are enacted
in one of the bills before us million seniors are deprived of meals homebound seniors are deprived of meals pelosi said
but first they acknowledged an error in pelosi s remark she should have said million meals for seniors not meals for million seniors
nancy pelosi says gop bill would deprive million seniors of meals
is middle ground million seniors not receiving meals i don t think so
