"President Obama in November of last year wiped away (a program) that allows for shared fingerprinting for those who are behind bars so you know who is here legally and illegally."
when you take away a program that allows for shared fingerprinting for those who are behind bars so you know who is here legally and illegally
faulkner said that obama ended secure communities a program that used fingerprint sharing to identify people in the country illegally
she is correct that obama ended that program but outside experts and ice itself told us that the process of sharing fingerprints and identifying people who are not supposed to be in america continues
obama did end the secure communities program but state and local law enforcement agencies still send the fingerprints of people they arrest to washington
the department of homeland security ended a program called secure communities that used fingerprints sent by local police departments to flag people who were in the country illegally
