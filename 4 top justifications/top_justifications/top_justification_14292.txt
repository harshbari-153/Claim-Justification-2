COVID-19 vaccines contain "RNA-modifying transhumanism nanotechnology."
madej said the vaccines contain transhumanism nanotechnology
transhumanism nanotechnology vaccine conspiracy theory is pants on fire
the only links between madej s description of the vaccine and what s actually in it are the term rna and the prefix nano
none of the vaccines contain nanotechnology of any sort let alone nanotechnology which isn t even a thing said mark lynas a visiting fellow at the alliance for science and cornell university
the mrna technology dates to the though this is the first time it has been used in widely disseminated vaccines
