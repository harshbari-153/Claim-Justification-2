Says HHS Secretary Alex Azar called family separations at the border and detention of children in cages "one of the great acts of American generosity and charity" and "is now in charge."
an equity forward ad says azar called family separations at the border and detention of children in cages one of the great acts of american generosity and charity and is now in charge
yet the ad said children were in cages and insinuated that azar was in charge of the separations and the treatment of children
the framing of the ad suggests azar said the separation and detention of children was a generous and charitable thing
azar does lead the department that has custody over the children but the separations are a result of prosecution referrals from homeland security to the justice department
why go after azar as hhs secretary he oversees the department that cares for children who were separated from their families by other agencies under the administration s zero tolerance prosecution policy for all immigrants who illegally enter the united states
