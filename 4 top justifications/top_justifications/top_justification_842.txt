Unvaccinated people "are making the vaccinated people sick and die, but the unvaccinated people are not dead or sick."
make it make sense unvaccinated are making the vaccinated people sick and die
but the unvaccinated people are not dead or sick
unvaccinated people not dead or sick false is hitting them hard
the cdc estimated july that the unvaccinated are times more likely than the vaccinated to be hospitalized or to die from the virus
but a viral image takes that relatively rare occurrence and wrongly claims that somehow unvaccinated people are escaping unscathed
