A "face mask exempt card" allows you to cite the ADA and not wear a mask.
an instagram post claimed that a face mask exempt card allows you to cite the ada and not wear a mask
a face mask exempt card doesn t exempt you from wearing a mask in public
while the card is phony we wondered whether there is a point about citing an ada exemption for face masks to evade some state and local mask requirements
enter the face mask exempt card
as uncomfortable as masks are we ve all gotten used to them by now but some people are saying you can use ada cards as exemptions from public mandates to wearing them
