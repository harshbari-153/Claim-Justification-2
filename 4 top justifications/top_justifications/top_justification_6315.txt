Says that voter identification laws "keep poor people from voting, minorities from voting, the elderly from voting, students from voting."
she went on to say i guess they think that we do understand they trying to keep poor people from voting minorities from voting the elderly from voting students from voting
the poor and minorities represent a high percentage who have not registered to vote and those who do not have government ids according to legal experts whose work we saw while researching this subject
and fudge s statement sounds and feels accurate to a lot of people many of them worried that voter id laws will be too restrictive
but the idea that the photo id law would reduce voting ignores an important detail that a lot of people just do vote
he cited another study the disproportionate impact of voter id laws on the electorate done recently by researchers at universities in new mexico arizona and washington who used national survey data from the election
