Says under the Romney-Ryan budget ... "the American Opportunity Tax Credit for college tuition would be eliminated."
budget would be end of the road for college american opportunity tax credit
romney thinks that students should borrow money or get help from their parents to help pay for college and under the budget college aid would be cut for nearly million students nationally and the american opportunity tax credit for college tuition would be eliminated
in some ads he has been as vague as to say that romney will eliminate the tax deduction for college tuition
but the budget also would eliminate the american opportunity tax credit that s one we hadn t examined yet so we decided to check it out
it s important to keep in mind that even though romney would allow the credit to expire that doesn t mean all tax deductions for college students would be lost
