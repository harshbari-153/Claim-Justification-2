"Since 2004, there have been some 1,300 attacks (on rail targets). Four thousand people have died. Thousands of injuries."
thousands of injuries and how can we ignore that when these areas are susceptible to terrorist inclinations given that the interview was about how congress would deal with rail security it sounded like lautenberg was saying there had been about attacks on trains in america over the last seven years
when we look at rail attacks the actual number of attacks is
those attacks caused deaths and injuries
since there have been some attacks
if bus attacks are factored in the senator is right about the number of total attacks but still off on the number of fatalities
