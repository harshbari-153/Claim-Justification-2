"At 17 years old Kyle (Rittenhouse) was perfectly legal to be able to possess that rifle without parental supervision."
based on the laws i can find of this area at years old kyle was perfectly legal to be able to possess that rifle without parental supervision
in august we a claim that it was perfectly legal for rittenhouse to possess an without parental supervision
since his lawyer has said that rittenhouse obtained the rifle from a friend in wisconsin meaning that he didn t transport it with him from illinois we re going to focus on the second half of the claim that it was perfectly legal for the teenager to carry a firearm in kenosha
but the facebook post claimed that it was perfectly legal for the teenager to carry an rifle in kenosha
post one facebook user said it was perfectly legal for kyle rittenhouse who was arrested in antioch ill
