At Twin River, "we're more than competitive" with nearby casinos in slot machine payouts.
twin river s spokeswoman says its slot machine payouts are more than competitive with nearby casinos
in response patti doyle spokeswoman for twin river one of rhode island s two slot parlors said in a radio interview that her casino gives better odds
it should be noted that neither twin river nor newport grand the state s other slot parlor sets the payout percentages of their slot machines
to summarize looking at the casinos as a whole the way foxwoods and mohegan sun calculate their payout percentages may make them look like a better bet for gamblers
those percentages are largely a function of the types of machines a casino has not whether it is actually giving gamblers better odds
