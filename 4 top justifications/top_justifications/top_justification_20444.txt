"The murder rate in our country is the highest itâ€™s been in 47 years."
the murder rate in our country is the highest it s been in years right trump said
but the murder rate is the highest it s been in i guess from to years
trump told the sheriffs the murder rate in our country is the highest it s been in years
however there s a difference between saying the country s largest cities experienced their biggest annual increase in homicides in more than four decades as trump said during the debate and saying that the country is experiencing its highest murder rate overall in more than four decades as he told the sheriffs
and during the second presidential debate trump said we have an increase in murder within our cities the biggest in years
