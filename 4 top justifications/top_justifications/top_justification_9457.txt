The Senate version of the economic stimulus package includes "millions of dollars to World War II Filipino veterans in the Philippines."
so back to kyl statement that the stimulus plan includes millions of dollars to world war ii filipino veterans in the philippines
does the senate version of the stimulus package really include millions for filipino vets
let me just mention one millions of dollars to world war ii filipino veterans in the philippines
the senate version of the bill does include provisions for a program to compensate filipino vets and most of those who would be eligible for payments live in the philippines
but here the thing if passed as currently written the money for the program would come out of the stimulus package
