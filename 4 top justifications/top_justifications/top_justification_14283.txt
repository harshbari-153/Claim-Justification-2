"Seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare."
the narrator in the ad among other things says that seniors will see billion in medicare cuts to fund obamacare
chamber said that seniors will see billion in medicare cuts to fund obamacare
so while the health care law reduces the amount of projected spending increases in medicare the law does cut medicare
medicare reforms were part of the health care legislation
the chamber is correct on one point however the spending reductions to medicare are intended to offset to some extent the overall cost of the new health care law
