Newt Gingrich "has suggested" building "a mirror system in space" could improve the Earthâ€™s habitability.
david brooks says newt gingrich once proposed putting mirrors in space
gingrich his book more than a quarter century ago and since he doesn t appear to have reiterated the call for floating mirrors in recent years we can safely assume the idea is no longer at the top of his policy agenda
here s how gingrich summarized the idea
in he saw more clearly than most that computers would touch every aspect of commercial and private life but nobody any longer wants to build a large array of mirrors that could affect the earth s climate warming it up so farmers could extend the growing season
the system seemed so outlandish that we felt compelled to check whether gingrich really suggested it
