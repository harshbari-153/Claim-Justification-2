the caption in the video title read see how the planes crashed again when china failed to launch air strikes near taiwan
but that title change which was not accompanied by a formal correction on the post came after the video generated thousands of comments with some people appearing to believe the footage showed an actual attempt by china to launch airstrikes near taiwan
