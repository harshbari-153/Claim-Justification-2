"Before Leaving, Obama Enacts Rules to Take $3,000 From EVERY American."
website wrongly says obama plans to take from every american
the assertion that obama did this right before leaving
a recent post in a website called conservative tribune is headlined outrage before leaving obama enacts rules to take from every american
finally contrary to the headline s implication americans will not be charged a fee because of action taken in obama s final weeks
and the annual cost of obama s regulations rather than the cumulative cost is a bit over a person according to the group s calculations
