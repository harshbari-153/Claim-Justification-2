"if your child gets this virus their going to hospital alone in a van with people they don’t know...to be with people they don’t know… you will be at home without them in their time of need."
a recent facebook post claimed that if your child gets this virus their sic going to hospital alone in a van with people they don t know
this sentence ended with a statement you will be at home without them in their time of need
to be with people they don t know
hospitalized children can have one parent present
the cdc also doesn t consider children a group for and have found that children who have been confirmed to have the virus have generally presented with mild symptoms
