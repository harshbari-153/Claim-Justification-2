"There is no reason to allocate 60 percent of bridge space to satisfy two percent of all travelers."
the essay acknowledges a need for more space for walkers and cyclists but adds this however there is no reason to allocate percent of bridge space to satisfy two percent of all travelers
looked at that way it s fair to say that roughly percent of the new space will be for vehicles although that calculation doesn t account for extra driving lanes at both ends to accommodate auto traffic or shoulder space to accommodate auto troubles
only about percent of the new bridge will be allocated to vehicular travel with the other percent dedicated to transportation in the form of bikeways and
it s not reasonable and even if you got it it doesn t negate my prior point there s no reason to allocate that much space for that mode
analysts at cascade posted a short essay on their website pointing out that most of the new bridge will be dedicated to two percent of bridge users even though cars carry nearly percent of all during the peak hours
