John McCain "voted against the Bush tax cuts, both times."
the ad is correct that mccain voted against tax cuts proposed by the bush administration two times in and
so we find the statement that mccain voted against the bush tax cuts both times to be mostly truethe ad gets it right that mccain voted against the tax cuts in and
we have to deduct a little bit for leaving the impression that there were only two votes on the tax cuts but the ad is correct that mccain voted against the measures
mccain was on the losing end of those votes the tax cuts passed
