"Congress only funded half the wall" between Mexico and the United States.
congress only funded half of the wall
border was only by congress
in congress approved building the wall in the southwest to restrict undocumented workers access into america
in fact the white house and congress have taken steps to pay for the remainder of the fence although there is still some disagreement about what form the fence will ultimately take
this wall is a horrendous example of washington misguided policy
