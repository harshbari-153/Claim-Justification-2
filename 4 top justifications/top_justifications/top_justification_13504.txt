Says a video shows a fox allowing itself "to feed koala babies in Australia."
this is motherhood reads the description of a recent youtube video claiming to show a fox feeding baby koalas in australia
no this isn t a video of a fox feeding baby koalas
we rate the youtube post that claims these baby animals are koalas falsethose are fox pups and no koala is going to get milk like that
that s because they re foxes not koalas
