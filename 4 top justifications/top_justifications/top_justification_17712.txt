"There's no money in Social Security."
but hinckley in his channel comments said social security has no money now
so saying that social security has no money is akin to saying that you broke if you have million in certificates of deposit but only cents in cash
when we asked hinckley about his statement that social security has no money he said he is correct because social security does have cash on hand
to summarize hinckley said there no money in social security
so maybe a better analogy would be saying that social security has no money is akin to saying that you broke if you have cents in your pocket but million in the stock of a heavily leveraged company
