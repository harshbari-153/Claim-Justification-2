Ann Kuster "supports the government takeover of healthcare, which robs Medicare of over $700 billion."
she supports the government takeover of healthcare which robs medicare of over billion a narrator says in the ad titled not working
kuster has expressed support for the affordable care act and the law has been shown to reduce medicare spending by billion
but does her support for the affordable care act really translate to support for a government takeover of health care and does the health care law really rob billion from medicare according to past politifact rulings the answer is no
but instead the congressman repeated past claims that the care act constitutes a government takeover of health care and that it robs billion from medicare
in that ruling politifact reported that the term government takeover refers to a european approach where the government owns the hospitals and doctors are public employees
