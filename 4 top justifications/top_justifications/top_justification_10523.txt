Says states that passed anti-illegal-immigrant legislation also had few Hispanic legislators.
we wondered if indeed states with laws targeting illegal immigration have few hispanic legislators
in more than states latinos comprise less than percent of each state s legislature about states have no hispanic legislators
rebecca forest says few latino legislators served in states that passed immigration enforcement measures
and i mean literally some of them have no hispanic legislators maybe or
according to a video pointed out by the texas democratic party rebecca forest and past president of the immigration reform coalition of texas said june if you really want to know why in texas we don t get immigration legislation passed it s because we have hispanic legislators in the texas legislature
