"Both the state and federal governments make more per gallon in gas taxes than the oil companies make themselves for doing all the work."
and i hope everyone realizes that both the state and federal governments make more per gallon in gas taxes than the oil companies make themselves for doing all the work
an institute report released in august suggests that per dollar of sales gas taxes are more than double the net income earned by the largest oil companies
in down years gas taxes paid by the industry and passed along to drivers at the pump can exceed even combined profits by percent
profits alone can top gas taxes paid by almost percent
and oil company profits have long been a debating point between the parties
