In 2001, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan "justified increasing spending and cutting taxes, saying that we didn't really need to pay down the debt."
but at no point did greenspan say that we did really need to pay down the debt
i served on the budget committee in the senate and i remember as vividly as if it were yesterday when we had a hearing in which alan greenspan came and justified increasing spending and cutting taxes saying that we did really need to pay down the debt outrageous in my view
but greenspan never suggested that we did really need to pay down the debt
in plain language greenspan was saying that the government should collect more taxes than it needs to run the government and tax cuts might be a good idea
it was at this point that greenspan testified about the budget outlook and bush proposed tax cuts before the senate budget committee which included clinton then a newly elected junior senator from new york
