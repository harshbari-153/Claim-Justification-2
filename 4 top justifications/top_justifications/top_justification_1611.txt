"If you look at most of the polls, this is a margin-of-error race on Fourth of July between Mitt Romney and the president."
our ruling christie said that if you look at most of the polls this is a race on fourth of july between mitt romney and the president
if you look at most of the polls this is a race on fourth of july between mitt romney and the president christie a top surrogate for romney said in an interview on cnbc s squawk box on tuesday
though almost all of those polls had the president ahead of his republican challenger the margins of error had the possibility of swinging the results in romney s favor
but the fact that a poll falls outside of the survey s sampling error doesn t mean that poll was right he said citing a june bloomberg poll that found obama points ahead of romney as an example
only two of those polls showed the president with a lead outside of the margin of error
