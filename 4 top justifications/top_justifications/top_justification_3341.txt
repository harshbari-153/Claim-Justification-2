"The most private question on this year’s form asks for an individual’s race, and that question has been asked by every census since the 1790 census conducted under then-President George Washington."
in his posting on red state mchenry said the most private question on this year s form asks for an individual s race and that question has been asked by every census since the census conducted under george washington
but we think it a bit of a stretch when mchenry says this year asks for an individual s race and that question has been asked by every census since the census
patrick mchenry claims every census in history has asked for an individual s race
yes the census and others in the early years of the survey addressed race but it was hardly a matter of checking a box
in the census and several after it a respondent was not simply asked their race
