Says state Sen. Paul Sarlo "said in February on NJTV, ‘there will be no tax increases in this budget’" and "voted the other night in the Senate Budget Committee to raise income taxes $800 million."
our ruling at a town hall meeting christie claimed sarlo said in february on njtv there will be no tax increases in this budget and voted the other night in the senate budget committee to raise income taxes million
oh and by the way that same senator paul sarlo chairman of the senate budget committee who said in february on njtv there will be no tax increases in this budget voted voted the other night in the senate budget committee to raise income taxes million said christie according to a video posted june on youtube
it s accurate that sarlo said there will be no new taxes in this budget and later voted to increase income taxes by around million in the new fiscal year
sarlo vowed to not include new taxes in the upcoming budget during a february tv interview and then voted last month to raise income taxes by around million in the new fiscal year
when discussing sarlo s vote to raise income taxes million the governor failed to mention that the tax hike only would apply to taxable income exceeding million
