Says some in Congress are trying "to create a separate government for those with a drop of Native Hawaiian blood."
rick perry says some in congress are trying to create a separate government for those with a drop of native hawaiian blood
among the examples of thinking he writes is the effort of some in congress to create a separate government for those with a drop of native hawaiian blood just google it it unbelievable
but some question whether congress has the authority to equate native hawaiians with american indians
would anyone with a drop of native hawaiian blood be subject to the proposed new government as perry claims
the proposal would authorize a separate government for native hawaiians one that proponents say would give the group the same right to extended to other indigenous people
