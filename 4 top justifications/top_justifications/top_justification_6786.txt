I spent only $36.29 on my campaign for governor.
moderate party s robert healey says he only spent about on his gubernatorial campaign
i would have doubled my numbers and maybe be the governor
the candidate also recycled signs from his past campaigns for lieutenant governor
on his campaign
in the end i did spend any money on signs
