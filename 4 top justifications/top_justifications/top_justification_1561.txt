Says Will Rasmussen supported a sales tax as recently as last spring.
house republicans accuse will rasmussen of supporting sales tax
upon review of the actual comments it is clear that while rasmussen might have mentioned a sales tax and yes we think transactions that may be taxable is pretty much code for sales tax he isn t advocating for one
are they trying to mask rasmussen support of a sales tax as recently as last spring we figured if we fact checked the democrats claim and found it to be a little less than truthful it might be worth our time to check in on the republicans too
in a political oregon house republicans are going after will rasmussen the democratic candidate for house district for allegedly supporting a sales tax
politifact oregon already looked into the charge levied against parrish and found it lacking but now republicans say rasmussen was just using those allegations as a way to cover up his own support for a sales tax
