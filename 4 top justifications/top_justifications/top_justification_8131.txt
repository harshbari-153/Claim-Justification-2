Says Wisconsinâ€™s 2011-13 state budget contains "no fee increases"
no fee increases in wisconsin s state budget wisconsin gop assembly speaker jeff fitzgerald says
to sum up fitzgerald said the new state budget contains no fee increases
jagler argued that the tuition hikes normally are not identified as fee increases in the state budget and that they are labeled as such this year only because the budget gives more autonomy to the uw system
when we asked fitzgerald for evidence to back his no fee increases claim we noted that the fiscal bureau which both political parties have long cited as a neutral scorekeeper on budget matters had determined the budget would raise nine fees over two years by million and reduce eight other fees by million
after the budget was approved by the assembly on june assembly speaker jeff fitzgerald said to pass a budget like this with no tax increases and no fee increases and put the state in the right direction is something we feel good about
