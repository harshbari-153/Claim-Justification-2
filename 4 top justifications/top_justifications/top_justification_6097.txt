A friend’s sister "died from Obamacare" because Blue Shield "completely just pulled out of California."
coulter said a friend s sister died from obamacare because she was thrown off her insurance plan you know blue shield completely just pulled out of california
but the claim that someone died from obamacare because blue shield completely just pulled out of california is something we can
ann coulter says a friend sister died from obamacare because blue shield of california left
the woman had been thrown off her insurance plan you know blue shield completely just pulled out of california
whatever the story of blue shield saying someone died from obamacare is incendiary and grossly misleading
