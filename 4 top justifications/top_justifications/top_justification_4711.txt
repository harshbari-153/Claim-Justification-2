"Gas is high because they shut down production in the U.S." under the Biden administration.
everyone here knows gas is high because they shut down production in the u
which is why gas prices are so high

there are many factors at play in the steady climb in gas prices since biden took office including increased demand after pandemic lockdowns ended inflation and now the war in ukraine
the post also falsely claims biden was installed in november with a graphic showing that the rise in gas prices began under his watch
