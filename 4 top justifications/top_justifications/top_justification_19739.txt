"A lot of the ideas in terms of the (health insurance) exchange, just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market, that originated from the Heritage Foundation."
a lot of the ideas in terms of the exchange just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market that originated from the heritage foundation
intentionally or not he gave himself subtle linguistic running room by saying that a lot of the ideas for the exchange came from heritage including the concept of just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market
the first is whether heritage did in fact originate the idea of health insurance exchanges
we found at least four papers that spoke directly to the health insurance exchange idea and in these papers we noticed several passages that advocated elements of an exchange that differ from how the bill was ultimately written
did heritage originate the idea our research suggests that while heritage has advocated for health insurance exchanges for many years others did too
