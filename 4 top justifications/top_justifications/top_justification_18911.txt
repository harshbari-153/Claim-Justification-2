The study that states that more than 70 percent of the traffic on the Sellwood Bridge is to/from Clackamas County has been thoroughly debunked by The Oregonian.
my statement that the oregonian debunked the study rather than the clackamas traffic may have been worded better he wrote adding that he was really bristling at previous media reports that characterized clackamas county residents as making percent of bridge trips which is not completely accurate
did the oregonian debunk a old study on sellwood bridge traffic
so we were initially pleased to read in the arguments against a new vehicle registration fee for the sellwood bridge this comment from clackamas county gop chairman john lee the study that states that of the traffic on the bridge is clackamas is over years old and has been thoroughly debunked by the oregonian
for example the oregonian published an editorial and a news story in february about a portland city club report which inaccurately stated that clackamas county drivers would account for three times the number of trips across the sellwood bridge as multnomah county drivers
but we have to object to his claim that the oregonian debunked a study that claimed more than percent of trips ends or starts in clackamas county
