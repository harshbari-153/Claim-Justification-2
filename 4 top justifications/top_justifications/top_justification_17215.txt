Potential Foxconn changes are due to "the wave of economic uncertainty" from Evers administration
is foxconn really making changes in reaction to economic uncertainty created by the state s governor
republican leaders vos and fitzgerald said in a joint statement that potential changes in foxconn s wisconsin plans are a result of economic uncertainty created by evers who has been governor for less than a month
but in the middle of that vos and fitzgerald made a very specific and concrete claim that foxconn was reacting to uncertainty evers caused
they say foxconn is changing due to evers but then note foxconn hasn t pulled back on its pledge to create new jobs
vos and fitzgerald say they understand foxconn changing its plans in an technology business but then blame evers for causing changes
