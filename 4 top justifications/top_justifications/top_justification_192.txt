"Walmart rewards everyone with $75 coupon to celebrate its 125th Anniversary"
why because the story says the mammoth retailer is celebrating its anniversary
first of all walmart was founded in
walmart targeted in online free coupon scam
more importantly for walmart fans the offer is not real
if you see an internet offer from walmart promising a coupon know that it s a scam
