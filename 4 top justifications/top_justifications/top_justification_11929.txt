Huckabee "granted 1,033 pardons and commutations . . . more clemencies than the previous three governors combined."
the total for huckabee years in office comes from an associated press examination of huckabee pardons and commutations
yes huckabee pardoned many
romney claim that huckabee granted more clemencies than the previous three governors combined also is correct according to the totals from the secretary of state
the ad says huckabee number is more clemencies than the previous three governors combined and says that romney himself has not issued any pardons
the result is a striking difference huckabee has granted more than while romney has granted any although he has said he would consider pardoning white house aide scooter libby because the case involved an overzealous prosecutor
