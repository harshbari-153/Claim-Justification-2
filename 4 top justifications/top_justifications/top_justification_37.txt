"Given how expansive our program already was," expanding Medicaid in New Jersey due to Obamacare "was a relatively small expansion."
and expanding medicaid in the state of new jersey given how expansive our program already was it was a relatively small expansion
because new jersey was already generous in its medicaid eligibility guidelines compared to other states the potential increase in medicaid enrollments due to obamacare is relatively small
new jersey medicaid expansion was small given already large program christie says
we wondered if christie was right in saying that new jersey only needed a minor medicaid expansion to comply with obamacare
this report was corrected to note that new jersey current medicaid coverage is percent and that would expand under obamacare in to up to percent of the poverty level
