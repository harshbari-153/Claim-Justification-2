"Americaâ€™s carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate far higher than any country in the world."
we gilbert s assertion that america s carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate higher than any country in the world
but it is certainly not true that america carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate far higher than any other country in the world
gilbert misstated the findings of an iea report when he said america s carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate far higher than any country in the world
they are unyielding in this pursuit of their agenda even though america s carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate far higher than any country in the world while we are presiding over one of the largest energy booms in world history
is cutting emission higher rate than any nation let alone a rate that gilbert described
