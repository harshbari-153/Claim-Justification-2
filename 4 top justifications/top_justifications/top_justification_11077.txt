Insurers delayed an Illinois man's treatment, "and he died because of it."
they delayed his treatment and he died because of it
to show that insurance companies can be callous president barack obama recently cited the case of an illinois man who obama said had died because of an insurer decision
still the president said that otto raddatz death was caused by a delay in his surgery caused by the insurer decision to rescind his policy
obama says decision to revoke insurance led to illinois man death
critics can still blame the insurance company for insensitivity and it true that the company only paid for raddatz treatment after the attorney general office acted but the evidence shows that it inaccurate to say a delay in care caused his death
