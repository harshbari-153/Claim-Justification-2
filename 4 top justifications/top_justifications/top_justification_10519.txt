in the race for governor democrat tom barrett said his opponent republican scott walker wants to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape incest or to protect the life of the mother
then as mike continues the words he says also appear on the screen scott walker wants to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape incest or to protect the life of the mother
tom barrett says scott walker wants to ban abortion even in cases of rape or incest
but barrett s claim which may be new to many viewers of the ad is that walker wants to outlaw abortion under any circumstances
we would note that as a member of the state assembly walker backed an effort to bar government employees from performing abortions and a bill outlawing abortion both measures included an exception for when the life of the mother is at stake
