Under Obamacare, Virginia taxpayers would have been "forced to pay for abortions" if the General Assembly had not recently intervened.
we wondered whether virginia taxpayers really were on the verge of being forced to pay for abortion and were spared from that requirement by mcdonnell s amendment
lawmakers passed the amendment this year to guarantee that most abortions in virginia would not be covered by the federal exchange
virginia lawmakers originally had anticipated creating a exchange and in passed a bill banning most abortions from being covered in the program
did excluding abortion coverage spare taxpayers from having to pay for it
that s because obamacare mandates a funding mechanism that will segregate premium payments for abortions from the federal subsidies some will receive to help cover the cost of care on the exchange
