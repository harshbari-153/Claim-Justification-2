"We're bankrupt."
is bankrupt
johnson said that we re bankrupt
would you describe yourself as bankrupt or impoverished
but johnson like paul went further than that saying that we re bankrupt in the present tense
here as before we re relying on common definitions of bankrupt that seem to best fit the context of paul statement
