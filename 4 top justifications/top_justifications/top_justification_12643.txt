scott said that nelson voted against requiring iran to recognize israel and release american hostages
while bill nelson voted against requiring iran to recognize israel and release american hostages the following year governor scott signed legislation that helped prevent state investments in iran scott said in a press release april
scott said nelson voted against releasing american hostages and iran recognizing israel as a sovereign state but multiple experts said the amendment was really just an attempt to kill the iran deal
we found that scott s claim mischaracterizes the vote nelson took and leaves out that nelson has actually advocated for the release of hostages in iran
by voting no nelson voted to continued debate on an amendment that experts said would have defeated the iran deal
