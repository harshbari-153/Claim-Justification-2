"In the four years before I became governor, we increased state debt $5.2 billion. We've paid it down $2 billion."
in the four years before i became governor we increased state debt
trillion national debt accumulated over years of the federal government borrowing money to pay for the cost of running the country
this is our second check on scott and the state debt
finally there was a spike in the debt after that was driven by a constitutional amendment to limit class sizes
we should note there s still another way to analyze debt debt actually issued by a governor
