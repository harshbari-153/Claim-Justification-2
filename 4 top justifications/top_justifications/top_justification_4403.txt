"Bernie Logic: Nobody can live on $7 an hour. We must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Also we must raise the tax rate to 52%. $15 an hour * 52% = $7.80. $15 an hour - $7.80 = $7.20. $7.20 an hour!!!"
sanders does support a new federal minimum wage to an hour
we must raise the minimum wage to an hour
a second viral post pops up about bernie sanders minimum wage tax plans it s just as wrong
but sanders isn t proposing huge tax increases on workers to make the math work
instead sanders has proposed increasing the tax rate for the country s highest earners to the new tax rate would apply to income earned only above million
