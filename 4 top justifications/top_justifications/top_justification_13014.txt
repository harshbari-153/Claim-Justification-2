"When you have unemployment below 4% and inflation above 4%, recession always follows within two years."
summers said when you have unemployment below and inflation above recession always follows within two years
on june summers told barron s that when you have unemployment below and inflation above recession always follows within two years
summers premise that there are a decent number of time periods when unemployment was below at the same time inflation was above has problems from the start
for about a year in unemployment was under while inflation was above
should be facing a recession sometime in the next months
