Says Gov. Tony Evers "proposed raising taxes on the agriculture industry to pay for expanded welfare programs."
did evers really try to raise taxes on agriculture to fund welfare
governor evers sudden concern for rural wisconsin and our agriculture industry is ironic given that just a year ago he proposed raising taxes on the agriculture industry to pay for expanded welfare programs state rep
but nygren is off base saying evers proposed raising taxes on agriculture
nygren said the governor proposed raising taxes on the agricultural industry to expand welfare programs
there is no doubt that his budget expanded welfare and that these tax increases were needed to pay for it
