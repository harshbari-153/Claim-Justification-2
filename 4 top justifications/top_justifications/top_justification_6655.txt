Says Gov. Chris Christie's decision to close the Elizabeth MVC "saved no money."
assembly majority leader joseph cryan says closing elizabeth mvc office saved no money
politifact new jersey decided to check whether it saved no money
despite three politifact new jersey requests to the mvc and office of legislative services for the actual amount saved from when the elizabeth office closed to present no one has been able to provide that figure
while the analysis didn t break down specific savings from each of the closed mvc offices it identified savings provided by the mvc from the combined closure of the offices in elizabeth bridgeton and wyckoff
in a march analysis report that includes a list of budget questions to agencies including the mvc the office of legislative services asked the mvc have these closings resulted in any cost saving so far and if so are these savings in line with expectations the mvc responded mvc has realized cost savings in fiscal year from the closure of five leased agencies wyckoff bridgeton elizabeth randolph and morristown
