People in the top tax bracket, "these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners."
does this mean that all those wealthy taxpayers were small business owners probably not
in conclusion do many wealthy tax payers report types of business income that might be from owning a small business sure
one of the arguments republicans use to support tax cuts for the wealthy is that most are small business owners
wealthy are actually small business owners the data is dubious
it impossible to know how many of these high earners are what most people think of as small business owners
