Hank Aaronâ€™s death was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine.
social media users imply that hank aaron s death was caused by a vaccine
no evidence that the vaccine caused hank aaron s death
but posts like this one mislead by implying that the vaccine caused aaron s death
social media users are suggesting that the moderna vaccine caused the death of baseball legend and civil rights advocate hank aaron
if aaron did die of a stroke that would make it even less likely that the vaccine contributed in some way to his death
