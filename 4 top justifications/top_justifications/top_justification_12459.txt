Says a poll shows that "without a name attached, Democrats are just one point behind" Gov. John Kasich.
without a name attached democrats are just one point behind redfern said
rather the state party chairman accurately explained where things stood a polling firm which he clearly cited showed a generic democrat trailing kasich by point
unlike the june survey in which voters were asked about potential democratic rivals by name this latest ppp poll generically framed the question regarding kasich s prospects
the pollsters also asked voters about hypothetical matchupsbetween kasich and several democrats
chris redfern says poll shows support for a nameless democrat within point of john kasich
