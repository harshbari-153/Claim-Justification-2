A CNN chyron said the Boulder "shooter was factually Arabic, but morally white."
no cnn chyron did not call boulder shooter factually arabic but morally white
a fake cnn chyron purports to show the network saying the man suspected of killing people in a mass shooting at a colorado supermarket was factually arabic but morally white
neither baldwin nor kafanov claimed that the suspect ahmad al aliwi alissa was factually arabic but morally white
baldwin interviewed kafanov who was reporting from boulder colo
this is actually laughable wonder if they are morally white said one march facebook post sharing the image which purports to show an interview between cnn anchor brooke baldwin and correspondent lucy kafanov
