"Biden says he doesnâ€™t need voters to get elected."
a video posted on tiktok claimed biden says he doesn t need voters to get elected
biden says he doesn t need voters to get elected said text over a short video of biden speaking during a campaign stop in michigan
but the context of that speech and similar speeches make it clear that biden is telling people that he needs their support to get him elected and that they should stay involved should he be elected
biden s campaign told politifact that biden throughout his campaign has expressed the sentiment of needing voters support when they cast their ballot and after that process
biden asked americans to vote and elect him president
