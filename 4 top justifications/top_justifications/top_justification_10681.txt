Rep. Peter Petrarca "voted on two pieces of legislation that helped auto body shops ... and at that point I think there is a conflict of interest."
peter petrarca had in the past voted for two pieces of auto body shop legislation and therefore his actions amounted to a conflict of interest
and considering petrarca professional and personal connections to the auto body shop industry his vote on them posed at least an appearance of conflict of interest
costantino said that while petrarca might not have voted on this most recent legislation he had voted on auto shop bills in the past which costantino described as a clear conflict of interest
we were curious what legislation costantino was referring to and whether he was correct in saying that petrarca whose law firm represents providence auto body and the auto body association of rhode island had indeed voted for them
the legislation was pushed by john petrarca president of providence auto body and his daughter jina spokeswoman for the auto body association of rhode island
