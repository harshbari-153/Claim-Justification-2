Says North Carolinians are "already paying for" Medicaid expansion, even though the state hasnâ€™t expanded Medicaid.
roy cooper said north carolinians are already paying for medicaid expansion even though the state hasn t expanded medicaid
yes north carolina is paying into medicaid but the state s costs would absolutely rise if it were to accept the expansion
north carolina has been part of the regular medicaid program since
however there s a second way that a listener might interperet cooper s claim that by telling people you re already paying for it he s implying that north carolina could accept the expansion of medicaid with no further costs
and cooper is right that nevertheless north carolinians are paying for the expansion in other states
