"Ivanka Trump is joining the Democrats to run against her dad."
ivanka trump is joining the democrats to run against her dad the video title says
no ivanka trump isn t joining the democratic party to challenge her father
ivanka trump was once a democrat who donated to democratic politicians but in october she officially changed her voter registration to republican
but over the course of nearly minutes ivanka trump doesn t come up in the video at all except for an opening question from the narrator that seems to contradict its title is ivanka really going to be trump s running mate
about a year later there was speculation that donald and ivanka trump could share the ticket in with ivanka trump replacing former vice president mike pence
