"Japanese whaling crew eaten alive by killer whales, 16 dead."
japanese whaling crew eaten alive by killer whales dead shouts a headline on a feb
tale of killer whales eating japanese whalers is fake news
a fake story being shared on social media about japanese whalers meeting an untimely end in the bellies of a pod of orcas may sound fishy for a reason it is
in a twist of irony too dark to be true because it isn t whalers were swallowed by killer whales within a half hour of hitting the water
the origin of this fish tale yes we know killer whales are mammals goes all the way back to july
