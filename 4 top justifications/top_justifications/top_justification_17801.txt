University of Wisconsin System's reserves are in the "mid- to low-range" of comparable university systems.
that data compared the uw system s primary reserve ratio to the ratios at five state university systems that are among the institutions the uw system considers to be its peers
reilly said uw system reserves are in the to of comparable university systems as though that fact has been clearly established
we were able however to find primary reserve ratios for three other state systems that can be compared to wisconsin s
using a key measure wisconsin s level of reserves is below that of some of its peers
that put wisconsin in the to low range in the uw system s comparison of primary reserve ratios although giroux acknowledged that the list of five institutions cited by the uw was not an exhaustive comparison but rather utilized financial reports that were available online
