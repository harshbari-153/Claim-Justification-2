"In Malaysia â€¦ many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in slave-like conditions."
sanders said in malaysia many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in conditions
so if you are in vietnam where the minimum wage is an hour or you in malaysia where many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in conditions no i not going to have american workers competing against you under those conditions
forced migrant labor and passport withholding is widely documented across malaysia by human rights and labor groups
the devil is in the details of actual implementation and malaysia is a very corrupt place where those with connections and money can get away with not complying with the law as both malaysian and migrant workers have found out frequently over the past two decades said phil robertson the deputy director of asia at human rights watch
malaysia is actually a prime example of labor rights possibly taking a backseat to free trade
