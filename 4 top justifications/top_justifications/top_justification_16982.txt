Of hospitals in Rick Scottâ€™s Columbia/HCA health care company, "A top executive said they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door."
the most shocking claim comes near the end of the ad a top executive said they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door
the words they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door flash across the screen
but the claim that a man died at one of the company hospitals after being turned away was new to us
we found no reference in the transcript to they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door
they turned away sick people
