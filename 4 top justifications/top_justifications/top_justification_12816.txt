"If you make more than $250,000 a year â€¦ you only really take home about $125,000."
even our most extreme example produced quite a bit more pay than he suggested
so even in this extreme and highly improbable example the taxpayer takes home more money than the doocy claimed
doocy said someone who earns a year ends up with pay of just
we found someone with that salary would take home to and even more if they lived in a state without income tax
but when you think about it at you only really take home about which in some parts of the country if you got a couple of kids in college is not much money
