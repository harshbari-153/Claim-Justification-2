In Massachusetts, Scott Brown's Republican affiliation is "not a secret, but clearly not on display."
so back to claim that brown republican affiliation was not a secret but clearly not on display
did brown go through the campaign without mentioning his party affiliation
another explanation was that brown went to great lengths to avoid identifying himself as a republican
we did find two brief instances one in a speech one in a news release in which brown referred to himself as a republican
but even in that speech brown made a point of undercutting his partisan label saying that he was speaking in the name of every citizen whether they be democrat or republican
