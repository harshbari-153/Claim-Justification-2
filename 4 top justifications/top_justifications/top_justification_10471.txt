Brazil built a $300 million stadium in the Amazon rainforest that "is only going to be used for four World Cup games," and thereâ€™s no team "that can fill it afterwards."
oliver said brazil built a million stadium in the amazon rainforest that is only going to be used for four world cup games and there s no team that can fill it afterwards
one project that epitomizes world cup waste he argued is a new stadium in a city within the amazon rainforest that cost the country more than million to build
okay that does seem like a waste of money especially when you consider that that stadium is only going to be used for four world cup games oliver said
another sore spot is the role of soccer s governing body the federation internationale de football association or fifa which chose brazil as the host country and will reap most of the profits from the mega event
an existing stadium with just seats had to be torn down in order to build a stadium that meets fifa regulations
