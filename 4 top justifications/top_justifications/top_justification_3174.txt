Measures taken by my administration "have saved taxpayers $1 billion."
combined these measures have saved taxpayers nearly billion
bottom line in the end carcieri statement that these measures saved taxpayers nearly billion requires further analysis and explanation
million of the savings
million was saved in fiscal year but other parts of those savings will be realized over the next years
but there no doubt that the carcieri administration mostly in concert with the general assembly helped save taxpayers a lot of money over the past eight years
