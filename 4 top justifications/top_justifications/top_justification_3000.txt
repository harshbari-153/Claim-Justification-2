"Just in the Austin MSA alone, 150 people move here every day."
just in the austin msa alone carrillo said people move here every day
carrillo said just in the austin msa alone people move here every day
in reality kerr wrote a good deal more than people or people move to austin each day but a lot of people move out too
but in we found mostly false a claim that people a day were moving to austin alone
but specific to what carrillo said census bureau work rooted in surveys taken in the five years through suggests that about people a day were moving into the region
