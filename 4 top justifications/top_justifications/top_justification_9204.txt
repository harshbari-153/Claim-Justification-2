Says Sen. Pat Toomey "even tried to shut down the federal government in order to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood."
attacking pat toomey did he try to shut down government over planned parenthood
but did toomey really try to shut down the federal government
this came about a week after toomey told new york magazine he didn t think it was a good idea to cause a government shutdown over planned parenthood
so toomey voted against a bill that averted a government shutdown
toomey s campaign condemned the majority forward ad saying the pac was lying and said toomey has fought to end government shutdowns
