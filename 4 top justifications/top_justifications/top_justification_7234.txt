"The president came in and campaigned against me 12 times."
the president came in and campaigned against me times kasich told sean hannity
obama hosted a for strickland and in a separate event pushed his economic polices
were made specifically to campaign for strickland and the democratic ticket
and on several of the stops strickland was at the president side nichols rightfully points out which certainly gives the impression that obama was visiting to stomp for strickland
and while it is true obama came to ohio in to help strickland with his bid for politifact ohio has also noted that the governor is clearly overstating the scope of the president s assistance
