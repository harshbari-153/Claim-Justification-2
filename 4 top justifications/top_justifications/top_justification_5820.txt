"The filibuster was never an idea of the founding fathers."
todd said the filibuster was never an idea of the founding fathers
well senator the filibuster was never an idea of the founding fathers he said
we wondered whether todd was right that the filibuster was never an idea of the founding fathers
the founders never wrote into the constitution a filibuster and contemporaneous writings suggest that the founders views ranged from ambivalent to negative about the value of delaying tactics in general
the filibuster was never established by a specific act it emerged organically
