Says the United Nations plans to "implant everyone with a biometric ID."
word on the world wide web is that the united nations is scheming to implant everyone with a biometric id
no the un is not planning to implant the world with biometric ids
a story by website truthandaction claims that the united nations is planning to have all humans imprinted with biometric identification cards by as part of its global goals agenda
but the claim that the un is planning to implant the world s population with a microchip id is far off
this conspiracy theory is an overreach of a system that the un is using to help identify refugees through biometrics that include facial recognition fingerprints and iris scans
