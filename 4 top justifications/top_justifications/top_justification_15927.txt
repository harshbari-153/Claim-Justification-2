"Bill White ...offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants."
gop chair cathie adams says bill white gave sanctuary to illegal immigrants as mayor of houston
offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants
none of this proves adams claim that white offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants
yet the only overt action on white watch was the decision at the end of his six years in office to join the secure communities program a federal initiative intended to make it harder not easier for illegal immigrants to remain in this country
whether the white administration approach helped make illegal immigrants feel at ease in houston is another question and not the one adams raised
