Says a photo shows a "lithium mine for hybrid cars."
lithium mine for hybrid cars
photo shows a gold mine not lithium mine for hybrid cars
the bottom photo does not show a mine to extract lithium an element used to make batteries
the key photo in this comparison is of a gold mine not a lithium mine so we rate the post falsein march we rated a similar post false because the lithium mine it alleged to be showing was actually a copper and cobalt mine
