"We were slow with the testing, but very quick with the travel ban. And that's been much more critical in saving lives."
we were slow with the testing but very quick with the travel ban
arguing in support of the white house coronavirus response watters said the united states was very quick with the travel ban and that was much more critical in saving lives
so was the administration very quick with a travel ban not really
are travel restrictions more critical in saving lives than testing not really
had we expanded testing during this time and still found few cases i would be more convinced that the travel ban had an impact
