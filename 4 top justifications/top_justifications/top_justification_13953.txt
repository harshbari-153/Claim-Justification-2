In the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, offshore drilling "did not cause any real difficulties."
talking about oil drilling and saying the storms did not cause any real difficulties seems like putting a happy face on a situation where damage did occur as a result of the oil and gas industry that permeates south louisiana
mccain statement about drilling not causing any real difficulties is cautiously phrased in comparison to remarks from some other political figures
without question oil spills did occur offshore in the wake of katrina and rita
i would remind you that off the coast of louisiana and texas they both had hurricanes that did not cause any real difficulties
but it a stretch to say the storms caused no real difficulties
