Russ Feingold "voted against the law that protected our lakes" and "was the only Great Lakes senator to vote no."
that fundamentally undercuts the ad claim that feingold was the only great lakes senator to vote against the bill
the ad says that russ feingold voted against the law that protected our lakes
feingold was not the only great lakes senator to vote no on the bill
feingold was the only great lakes senator to vote no
as a result johnson has some justification for saying that feingold voted against the law that protected our lakes
