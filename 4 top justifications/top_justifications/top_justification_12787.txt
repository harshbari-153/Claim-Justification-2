Says Hillary Clinton "paid for a Russian dossier to win an election," her husband "made $500k for a Russian speech," "sold 20% of US Uranium to Russia" and her foundation "received $150M from Russia."
the claim that clinton sold of us uranium to russia exaggerates the percentage involved and clinton role she didn t have sole power over the deal
does anyone else find it strange the same woman who paid for a russian dossier to win an election whose husband made for a russian speech who sold of us uranium to russia whose foundation received from russia keeps calling others russian assets
the first that clinton paid for a russian dossier to win an election contains a hint of truth that the clinton campaign paid the firm that wrote the steele dossier but it isn t the full picture
and in the course of our investigation of clinton s federal financial disclosure forms we found that former president clinton gave a talk in to a russian finance corporation
and it s an exaggeration to say that the clinton foundation received from russia it may be closer to million from uranium one investors
