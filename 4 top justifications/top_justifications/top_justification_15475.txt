Rare is the president "who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated."
in his cabinet meeting trump said that rare is the president who passed more legislation who done more things than what we done between the executive orders and the regulations that have been terminated
these are significant policy changes but it s important to note some caveats about trump s use of executive orders
i will say that never has there been a president with few exceptions in the case of fdr he had a major depression to handle who passed more legislation who done more things than what we done between the executive orders and the regulations that have been terminated trump said later adding we achieved tremendous success
and while some of his executive orders have made an immediate impact most have merely expressed his policy preferences or set in motion a process that may or may not change policies down the road
around the point of trump s presidency we found that white house press secretary sean spicer was accurate on the numbers when he said that the current president has worked with congress to pass more legislation in his first days than any president since harry truman
