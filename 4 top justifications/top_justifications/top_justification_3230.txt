In most Muslim countries, "We can't have a church. We're not able to build synagogues. It's forbidden."
for someone to say we are not allowed to build a church in a muslim country this is absolutely not right
we not able to build synagogues
we not able to build synagogues
rev franklin graham says churches and synagogues are forbidden in most muslim countries
and so he said no churches or synagogues are allowed there
