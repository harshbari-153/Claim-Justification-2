our ruling romney said that five studies show that his tax plan can cut rates and still bring in the same amount of money as today without raising taxes on the middle class
our focus is on whether romney is correct that they show romney s tax plan can cut rates and still bring in the same amount of money as today without raising taxes on the middle class
briefly that plan would cut individual and corporate rates eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax give savings and investment income preferential treatment and still keep total tax revenues the same
growth creates more income for the government to tax which would help offset the revenues lost through rate cuts
this is particularly true when tax cuts are combined with which lies at the heart of the romney plan
