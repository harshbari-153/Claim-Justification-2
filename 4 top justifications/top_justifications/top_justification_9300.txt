cagle said that a homeland security study showed murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ice and homeland security
customs and immigration enforcement and the important feature of this is that criminal illegal aliens it was demonstrated with a homeland security study that showed murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ice and homeland security cagle said oct
david lapan spokesman for dhs told politifact that neither dhs or ice had published a report showing that murders could have been prevented in communities if they complied with immigration authorities
the point in referencing this shocking number of murders is that homeland security concluded at least homicides were committed by convicted criminal illegal aliens
given the national debate about sanctuary cities we wondered if cagle was right that the department of homeland security had determined that murders might not have happened if communities cooperated with immigration authorities
