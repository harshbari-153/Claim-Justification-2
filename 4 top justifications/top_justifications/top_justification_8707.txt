Says Mitt Romney has said different things about whether global warming is caused by humans
we will be watching to see if romney is asked again about his thoughts on global warming we were unable to find any other remarks since then about whether he thought human beings contribute to global warming or not
in october romney said that we don t know what s causing climate change on this planet
rick perry s statement that scientists are questioning the original idea that global warming is what is causing the climate to change
but his comments about the cause of global warming did change markedly
in this case a voter asked romney what is your position on global warming and would you reject legislation such as cap and trade which is based on the idea of global warming romney first said he was opposed to then said this my view is that we don t know what s causing climate change on this planet
