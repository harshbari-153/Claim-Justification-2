"October 2013, Obama shut down the government for 16 days to force Obamacare."
post from kristy greczkowski said oct obama shut down the government for days to force obamacare
a facebook post said that obama shut down the government in to force obamacare
warned that a shutdown would be a bad idea and in any event wouldn t block most of obamacare from moving forward
in that sense obama was not fighting to force obamacare because he didn t need to
in obamacare was already law
