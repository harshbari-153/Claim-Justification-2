Barack Obama has "never even worked in business."
then you have barack obama who never started a business never even worked in business portman said
at gop convention rob portman says barack obama never even worked in business
however portman went too far when he said that obama has never even worked in business
we interpreted portman s statement to mean that obama had never worked in a private enterprise
our rating clearly obama has had less experience in the private sector than romney before he became president he spent most of his working life either in the sector or in politics
