"When you tally up their representation in Congress and governorships, the Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years."
when you tally up their representation in congress state legislatures and governorships the democrats almost have their lowest representation in about years
zakaria said when you tally up their representation in congress state legislatures and governorships the democrats almost have their lowest representation in about years
given zakaria s hedging he said democrats almost have their lowest representation in about years we think his claim passes muster
according to rcp data the only time democrats had a weaker standing in the past years was in when they controlled a mere governorships
the lowest ever since democratic representation in the states was in when only ds were serving in state legislatures
