Obama's position on nuclear arms is a "march toward global zero."
jon kyl says obama nuclear arms policy is a march toward zero
we looked into several comments made by kyl about the new start treaty but here we are weighing whether it accurate to characterize the obama administration position on nuclear arms as a march toward global zero
kyl statement about obama march toward global zero may have been a bit of a bumper sticker slogan but it was also completely accurate and an unusually candid assessment of the differing philosophies on nuclear arms reduction said john pike director of globalsecurity
some examples a presidential campaign position paper on foreign policy promised that obama will make the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide a central element of u
there little question that obama stated goal even before he became president has consistently been a world free of nuclear weapons
