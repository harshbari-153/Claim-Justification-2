In Texas, "a faceless hospital panel can deny life-sustaining care, giving you only 10 days to find another facility for your mother, dad, or young child, even if the patient is conscious."
texas right to life said in texas a faceless hospital panel can deny care giving you only days to find another facility for your mother dad or young child even if the patient is conscious
there is no faceless hospital panel
an ad targeting a republican state senator opened with what sounded like a heartbeat and a wailing siren in the background as the narrator read words displayed on screen if your loved one is in the hospital you may be shocked to learn that a faceless hospital panel can deny care giving you only days to find another facility for your mother dad or young child even if the patient is conscious
update on may we rated as mostly false a claim by texas right to life that in texas faceless panels can judge whether to continue a person care
is it possible a conscious person could be denied treatment because of the actions of a committee i in the sense the ethics committee has to be consulted and if it is consulted and agrees with the primary doctor then this doctor after a period of time is not obligated to provide that treatment
