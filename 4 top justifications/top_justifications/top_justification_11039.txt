"The House GOP super PAC in DC is spending more to help my opponent than anyone else."
in a recent tweet davis the democrat running for the seat that includes topeka lawrence and communities west of kansas city said that the house gop super pac in dc is spending more to help my opponent than anyone else
the davis campaign says that the house gop super pac is spending more to help out watkins than anyone else
no the house gop super pac is spending the most in kansas but they are spending a lot
it is going on all over the country but paul davis campaign claims that an outside gop pac is spending the most in kansas congressional district
it is true that the congressional leadership fund the leading gop super pac affiliated with house republican leadership is pouring money into the district but the davis campaign is exaggerating
