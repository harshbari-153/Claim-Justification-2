Says that Republicans "bragged about how every bill was going to be paid for, right from the beginning" and that the first vote, the repeal of health care reform, violated that rule.
this moved sherrod brown the senior senator from ohio to observe that republicans bragged about how every bill was going to be paid for right from the beginning
but before taking that vote the republicans in the house also scuttled pay as you go provisions that democrats had restored in requiring any increased expenditures flowing from a new piece of legislation to be offset by decreases in other programs
that s what brown cites when he says the health reform bill would be paid for
republicans dispute those estimates and argue that health reform will drive up the deficit
so where does that leave brown s claim on the the senator is correct that house republicans did pledge to not approve any legislation that would push up the federal deficit
