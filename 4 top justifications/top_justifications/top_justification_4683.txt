Says challenger Dominic Chavez is a "Rick Perry Republican" lobbyist.
bill spelman says dominic chavez is a rick perry republican lobbyist
republican lobbyist dominic dom chavez is a rick perry republican spelman says also asking whether we really want chavez to push a rick perry agenda for austin on the council
we can see why someone might suspect chavez of being a republican and maybe even a perry fan
finally chavez once lobbied for a group and not republicans contrary to spelman s statement which also leaves the inaccurate impression that chavez is a lobbyist now
armed with butts offerings we turned to chavez who told us he was previously a lobbyist for a group while he has voted in both party primaries
