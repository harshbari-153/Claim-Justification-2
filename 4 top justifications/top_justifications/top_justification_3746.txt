when fidel castro came into office you know what he did he had a massive literacy program
sanders said that when fidel castro came into office in cuba he had a massive literacy program
but castro did significantly expand literacy rates after seizing power
the academic consensus seems to be that fidel castro s government did increase the literacy rate of the island s population at the same time that it clearly used the literacy campaign for propaganda purposes said jorge duany director of the cuban research institute at florida international university
as for the literacy effort in castro s own words the goal wasn t simply to teach but to instill political beliefs
