in those five states there is no option for consumers who want a health plan that does not cover abortions
the rhode island catholic newspaper said that rhode island is one of the few states that does not offer an insurance option that excludes most abortion coverage
the affordable care act does not require states to offer abortion coverage beyond that
catholic paper says health exchange one of few in without plan excluding abortion coverage
if the federal government will eventually require all health insurance exchanges including rhode island s to offer at least one plan that doesn t cover most abortions how could raimondo oppose it
