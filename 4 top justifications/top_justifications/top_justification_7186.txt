oh our law enforcement agencies have found bodies in the desert either buried or just lying out there that have been beheaded she said
it would be clear from the bones peters said if there were a traumatic removal from the remainder of the body
we have had a single death due to a beheading or having a beheading associated with it
reporters from the arizona guardian and television station talked to several other medical examiners in counties along or near the mexican border and all said the same thing no beheadings there
he then added a grisly if clinical explanation as a body decomposes local animals will use the deceased as a food source and sometimes the head can become from the spine
