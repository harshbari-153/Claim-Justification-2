"Harry Reid was against (the nuclear option) before he was for it. Mitch McConnell was for it before he was against it. President Obama was against it before he was for it."
harry reid was against this before he was for it
mitch mcconnell was for it before he was against it
president obama was against it before he was for it
but in with a president from his own party trying to approve nominees reid invoked that very option
on the senate floor that may he spoke against the nuclear option the very same procedural change he invoked as the majority leader seven years later
