a graphic that popped up in a news release and tweets from an array of republicans many later deleted or updated claimed wisconsin residents who aren t citizens could get tuition in three years but veterans have to wait five years
jesse james ken skowronski jim ott john spiros and tony kurtz said immigrants would get a break on tuition after three years while military veterans must wait five years
so the wait is five years for one category of veterans and three years for undocumented immigrants which is the number republicans focus on
meanwhile the veteran s program cited is for tuition remission
