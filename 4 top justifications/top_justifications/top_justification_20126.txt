Says opponent David Dewhurst is a "career politician."
tom leppert says david dewhurst is a career politician
at the time mccoy said dewhurst repeatedly called raymond a career politician
in contrast he said a dewhurst predecessor as lieutenant governor bob bullock started in politics as a young man and was absolutely a career politician
our take dewhurst may be into his second or third or fourth career
it would be comical for dewhurst to claim that after spending the past years in statewide elected office including three terms as lieutenant governor that he is not a career politician mccoy said
