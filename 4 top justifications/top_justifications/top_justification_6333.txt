Says Wisconsin Republicans "pushed for long lines and polls open for one day only."
the democratic party of wisconsin in a fundraising email said wisconsin republicans pushed for long lines and polls open for one day only
while we pushed for vote by mail and expanded early voting they ve pushed for long lines and polls open for one day only wisconsin democrats said in the message
and although republicans did advocate for an election the claim that they pushed for long lines is off the mark
the assertion that republicans advocated for polls open for one day only keys in on the rejection of extending absentee voting but ignores gop messages encouraging early voting
wisconsin dems ignore key details in saying gop pushed for longer lines and limited voting time
