trump said percent of the people agree on daca
for now we were curious about trump s claim that percent of people agree on a solution for daca recipients
several polling and public opinion experts we reached out to say they were not aware of any recent poll showing a percent support for daca but that a solid majority does seem to favor the program
after the trump administration announced it was eliminating daca found that of registered voters polled percent said it was the wrong thing to do percent said it was the right thing to do percent did not know or had no opinion
adults also found that percent of responders somewhat or strongly supported daca though support for the program was lower among trump voters and republicans
