"Mark Harris has said he would abolish the Department of Education."
mccready said mark harris has said he would abolish the department of education
debate when he said harris a former pastor was on the record saying he would abolish the department of education
we did google and nexis searches and discovered two reports from the charlotte observer that said harris had suggested he would like to eliminate the department of education
clearly harris was on board with tillis s suggestion that the education department should be eliminated even if he also included the energy and commerce departments in his response
we wondered if harris who defeated pittenger in the republican primary actually said he would eliminate the education department which has been around since
