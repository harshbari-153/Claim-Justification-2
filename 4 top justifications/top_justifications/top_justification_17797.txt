joe biden the ranking member of the foreign relations committee recommended partitioning iraq into three separate entities
former president george bush says that as a senator joe biden recommended partioning iraq
but when news articles used partition or soft partition to describe biden proposal the senator took exception to the label mindful that in foreign policy it is a loaded term
such a plan for soft partition as opposed to which involves outright division of iraq is consistent with the plan according to the paper
long story short biden proposed dividing the country into three separate and regions while retaining a federal system to handle border security and other common concerns
