Brookhaven homeowners pay hundreds of dollars less in property taxes compared with owners of the same-value homes in unincorporated DeKalb County.
add in the fact that brookhaven residents pay more in stormwater fees than those in unincorporated dekalb and the final savings is less than and respectively dekalb deputy tax commissioner robert goodman said
brookhaven backers promised in meetings a new city would mean lower taxes and better services
brookhaven residents must still pay that debt since they were part of unincorporated dekalb when the money was borrowed
that disproportionately benefits homeowners in unincorporated dekalb who get the credit on a bigger part of their tax bill since they do not pay city taxes
on the face of it to say your property tax bill will be lower in brookhaven is correct but not nearly by the amounts stated goodman said
