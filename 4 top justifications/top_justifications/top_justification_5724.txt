"In my 30 year career including dozens of capital cases, not a single client of mine has ever been sentenced to death."
so the comes down to this question is it fair for a lawyer to say none of his clients have ever been sentenced to death when a major client of his received a death sentence in a case he didn t litigate after being disqualified from representing him
in his statement said the article had incorrectly claimed former client anthony brown was given a death sentence and that not a single client of his had ever been sentenced to death
the long statement released friday also suggested briggs had incorrectly stated the former client of el shabazz was on death row and included this line in my year career including dozens of capital cases not a single client of mine has ever been sentenced to death
has really never represented someone who was sentenced to death
but a former client of kaboni savage received a death sentence
