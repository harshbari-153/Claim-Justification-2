Hostages were released as soon as Ronald Reagan took office because Iran perceived that America was "no longer under the command of someone weak."
rubio said that iranian hostages were released in as reagan took office because iran perceived that america was no longer under the command of someone weak
instead the iranians had tired of holding the hostages and that the administration of jimmy carter did the legwork to get the hostages released
there a reason why the iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that reagan was sworn in
well before reagan became president the deal for releasing the hostages had already been worked out by the carter administration state department and the iranians ably assisted by algerian diplomats said david farber author of taken hostage the iranian hostage crisis and america first encounter with radical islam
rubio replied when i become president of the united states our adversaries around the world will know that america is no longer under the command of someone weak like barack obama and it will be like ronald reagan where as soon as he took office the hostages were released from iran
