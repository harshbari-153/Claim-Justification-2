The Obama administration notified Poland and the Czech Republic about cancellation of major missile-defense facilities "at the last minute in midnight phone calls."
in this item we will try to determine the timing of when the obama administration told the czech republic and poland of the decision
and although there is a discrepency about the time of the final notification for poland the reports indicate that obama first tried about midnight
according to agence france presse the czech leader said that poland had been informed in the same way as he himself had been
cheney also rapped the white house for sloppy diplomacy in its decision to cancel a planned radar in the czech republic and planned missile interceptors in poland
so the time between obama s call to fischer and the formal white house announcement was about hours most of which was nighttime in one country or the other
