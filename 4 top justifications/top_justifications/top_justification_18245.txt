"Obama has proposed a 1.4% pay increase for active duty military in 2011. This is THE LOWEST SINCE 1973 ... A LOWER PAY INCREASE THAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS!!!"
according to that document military personnel got no pay increase in making obama proposal the smallest since then
in fact the last president to use this authority was bill clinton who actually proposed no pay increase for the military in according to colonel michael hayden deputy director of government relations for the military officers association of america
obama pay increase for the military based on formula
this is the lowest since nice to know that during a time of rampant inflation while war is fought in theatres our men and women in uniform get a lower pay increase than welfare recipients please repost if you support our troops this is a first for us the claim is part status update part chain
but the smallest since as the facebook message suggests it seems that number came from news reports that if approved the pay increase would be the smallest since the military became an force in and military pay rates were overhauled to match private sector pay for civilian workers with similar skills education and experience
