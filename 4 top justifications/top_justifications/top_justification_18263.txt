Challenger Tim Tuggey "is a lobbyist who donated over $41,000 to Democrats who support abortion and same-sex marriage."
tuggey actually gave more than to democrats or democratic committees though mercer ad overlooks tuggey donations to republicans and the history of tuggey s firm representing the bexar county republican party and gop candidates
tuggey initially told us all his democratic donations occurred because he was helping clients advance issues such as keeping taxes low or funding veterans care
tuggey doesn t deny he s helped democrats
the other replies dad s opponent is a lobbyist who donated over to democrats who support abortion and marriage
our check of state and federal records shows that tuggey donations to democrats amounted to to nine candidates for federal office and three national political committees plus donated to democratic candidates for state office
