Says Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden backs a fracking ban that would cost 100,000 Wisconsin jobs
trump victory said that by backing a ban on fracking biden would cost wisconsinites their jobs
no joe biden doesn t want to ban fracking and kill the wisconsin jobs the industry supports
does biden really support eliminating fracking entirely and would the elimination of fracking impact wisconsin jobs
biden does not support an outright fracking ban though he did speak inaccurately about his stance on the issue in a march debate
following the debate a biden campaign representative clarified the position saying biden wants a ban only on new fracking activities on federal lands and waters according to a politifact item from june and another from july
