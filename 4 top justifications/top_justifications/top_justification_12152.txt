"Kelly Ayotte has voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act."
hassan said that kelly ayotte has voted four times against the federal paycheck fairness act
it is extremely troubling that kelly ayotte has voted four times against the federal paycheck fairness act which would help ensure that women can earn equal pay for equal work
maggie hassan says kelly ayotte repeatedly voted against paycheck fairness act
kelly ayotte had not only voted against equal paychecks for women but she had done so multiple times
so although ayotte opposed the bill being debated and has said so repeatedly in public it s not entirely accurate at least in three of these cases to say that she voted against the paycheck bill itself
