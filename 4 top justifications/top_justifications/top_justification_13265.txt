"Greg Abbott and his surrogates have referred to women who have been the victims of rape or incest as though somehow what they are confronting is a minor issue."
davis said abbott and his surrogates have referred to women who have been the victims of rape or incest as though somehow what they are confronting is a minor issue
it is not acceptable that greg abbott and his surrogates have referred to women who have been the victims of rape or incest as though somehow what they are confronting is a minor issue
and i think that most telling is the fact that greg abbott has not come forward to disavow matt mackowiak s characterization of women who have been victimized by rape and in cases of incest as though somehow they ve suffered a minor issue
mackowiak who has his own report card took exception to davis characterization of his comments and urged us to check whether whether abbott or his surrogates as davis said referred to victims of rape or incest as if they d experienced minor events
davis got this wrong various ways given that the individual in question a republican consultant who doesn t work for abbott immediately clarified on the air he was saying few abortions occur after incidents of rape or incest
