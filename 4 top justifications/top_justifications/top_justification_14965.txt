Says that in fiscal year 2010, "nearly 80 percent of women served" in the Texas Womenâ€™s Health Program received services from a provider other than a Planned Parenthood clinic.
nearly percent of the women served in the women s health program in fiscal did receive a service from a parenthood provider
that s the number of women who got all of their women s health program services from providers not linked to planned parenthood or percent not percent of the women served in the program in those months
the available state data show that percent of women s health program clients in fiscal received all their services from a provider not linked to planned parenthood
nearly percent of the women who received services under the program did so from a provider that wasn t planned parenthood
in other words the number of women who received services from planned parenthood in fiscal plus the number of women who received services from all other providers adds up to more than the total number of women served in the program that year
