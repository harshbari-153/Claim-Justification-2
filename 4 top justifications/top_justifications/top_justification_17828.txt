"The amount of interest" paid on the federal debt exceeds "total tax revenue."
kapenga said the amount of interest paid on the federal debt exceeds the federal government s total tax revenue
debt it stated that the interest you pay on your debt exceeds your total tax revenue when it should have said total corporate tax revenue
in fact tax revenue is a number of times higher than what the government pays in interest on the debt
whoa just the amount of interest we pay on the federal debt is more than all the tax revenue uncle sam takes in
so how do interest payments on the debt and total tax revenue compare
