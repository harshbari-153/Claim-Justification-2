(Rep. Bob Goodlatte's) balanced budgetÂ amendment does not require a balanced budget.
let s review scott said that no provision in goodlatte s balanced budget amendment would require balancing the budget
scott says balanced budget amendment does not require balanced budget
so would goodlatte s amendment require a balanced budget for an answer to this semantic question we first turned to the congressional budget office which analyzed the bills in a june letter to lamar smith the chairman of the house judiciary committee
you could say in a very technical sense a balanced budget is not required if congress has an escape clause but of course that s par for the course in a constitutional amendment
robert greenstein the center s president said in a july statement that goodlatte s amendment was one of several pending before congress that would essentially require that the budget be balanced within the coming decade
