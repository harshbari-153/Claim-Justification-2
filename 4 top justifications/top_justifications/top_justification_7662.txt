"Prairie State power plant is the cleanest coal-fired power plant in the nation."
davis said the prairie state power plant is the cleanest power plant in the nation
the municipally owned prairie state power plant is the cleanest power plant in the nation he said during his june visit
no southern illinois prairie state is not the nation s cleanest coal plant
while experts say there are multiple ways to evaluate which coal plants are the cleanest beyond total emissions which tend to single out the power plants producing the most electricity prairie state ranked nowhere near the top based on any of the yardsticks we found to measure it
calling prairie state the cleanest coal plant in the country he added would be absurd
