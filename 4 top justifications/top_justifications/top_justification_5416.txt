"Houston Texans coming out for the Black National Anthem then going into the locker room for THE REAL NATIONAL ANTHEM is DISGRACEFUL."
houston texans coming out for the black national anthem then going into the locker room for the real national anthem is disgraceful the post says
while this facebook post is correct that the texans stayed in their locker room for the national anthem it s wrong about the team s actions during the song known as the black national anthem and it misleads readers into thinking the players pointedly took the field for one song and not the other
during the game chiefs players and coaches stretched across one of the end zones while a video of alicia keys singing the black anthem played on video boards usa today reported while the texans remained in their locker room
at that point the texans ran onto the field and both teams came together at the center of the field for what the public address announcer called a moment of silence to support racial equality in our country according to usa today
the post gets part of the story right texans did stay in their locker room for the banner
