Republicans "went out of the way to praise (Eric) Holder's nomination. ... Not a single Republican senator opposed Eric Holder's nomination."
did republicans go out of their way to praise holder s nomination
limbaugh said republicans went out of the way to praise eric holder nomination
given that holder s tenure has subsequently become a focal point for republican disapproval of the obama administration we wondered did at least some republican senators go out of the way to praise holder s nomination in and when it came time to vote on his nomination for attorney general did every republican vote to confirm him
still we do think they support limbaugh s assertion that republicans went out of the way to praise eric holder nomination
not a single republican senator opposed eric holder nomination
