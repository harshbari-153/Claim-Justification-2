"I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature"
garcia said i cut spending while serving in the state legislature
i cut spending while serving in the state legislature and will take that experience to washington garcia declared in one of her first statements on her twitter account
state marilinda garcia says she cut spending as a legislator
claiming to cut spending is a pretty broad statement but we ll start with the major vote new hampshire legislators take to increase or cut spending consideration of the state s biennial budget
in garcia s case she is a legislator not an executive so she can t unilaterally cut spending
