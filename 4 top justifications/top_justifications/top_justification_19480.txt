As executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia there were "300 people on my payroll in 2008."
asked how many people he supervised as executive director of the state democratic party stoney said there were people on my payroll in
we counted people listed as payroll employees
records show the state party s payroll did hit that fall as it hired temporary field workers to help obama s presidential campaign in virginia
the field staff was funded by millions of dollars pumped into the state party by the democratic national committee and obama s campaign
stoney replied well when i was executive director of the democratic party i was able to run the operations of a dollar organization a dollar operation that featured people on my payroll in the year
