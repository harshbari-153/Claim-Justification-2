In President Barack Obama’s 2015 State of the Union address, "the words ‘al-Qaida’ were never used, the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001."
baier said the words were never used the first time those words have not been used in a state of the union address since february
obama s first speech to congress in was also not technically a state of the union though it was covered and delivered like one
this was the same speech again technically not a state of the union in which obama called for the closure of the detention facility in guantanamo bay cuba which is still open
fox news chief political anchor said president barack obama s state of the union address was remarkable for what it left out
and as for last night s speech see our annotation no direct mention of but obama did reference terrorists
