The GOP health bill "would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition."
in my statement i said that this bill would once again allow a rape or domestic violence victim to be a condition
chu said the legislation would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a condition in a press release on may
this allows for the real possibility that sexual assault victims who seek medical treatment could face challenges in getting health insurance if the republican bill becomes law she said
but the headlines that say the gop bill makes sexual assault a condition are hyperbolic based on the what the bill actually says
for victims of sexual assault in particular the bill could have a chilling effect she added
