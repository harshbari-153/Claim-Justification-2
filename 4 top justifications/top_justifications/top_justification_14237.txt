"I would love to see us have in this country what I helped lead in Arkansas...Amendment 65 (which) says that we believe life begins at conception, and that we ought to do everything in the world possible to protect it until its natural conclusion."
it also is a slight overstatement to say the arkansas amendment declares a belief that life begins at conception though that certainly is implied
here what it says the policy of arkansas is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception until birth to the extent permitted by the federal constitution
arkansas does indeed have an amendment to its state constitution concerning human life but huckabee overstates the impact of the amendment
it is amendment that deals with abortion
huckabee statement that the amendment says everything in the world possible must be done to protect the unborn is pretty sharply limited by the phrase to the extent permitted by the federal constitution
