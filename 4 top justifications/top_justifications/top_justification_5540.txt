"He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year."
he voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making a year mccain said in the presidential debate oct
this time mccain correctly noted the tax votes came on budget resolutions
the resolutions approved on mostly votes expressed support for rolling back tax cuts enacted under president bush for people making a year and higher
but it s inaccurate to suggest that votes on nonbinding budget resolutions which don t have the force of law and don t include precise details on taxes or spending are the same as votes on legislation that actually increases taxes
so the mccain campaign is correct that obama voted for the measures which expressed approval for tax increases
