Says he "paid one dollar for" a sweater at Kohlâ€™s.
so well that he pointed to the sweater he was wearing and declared we paid one dollar for it with our kohl s cash
at the center of the story a new sweater a dollar and menomonee kohl s
we couldn t find that sweater available on the kohl s web site so we visited the kohl s store in glendale to paw through the clearance racks
i went to a kohl department store and i bought something for the price it was marked at walker said adding that he s now been trained well about how to shop at kohl s
but walker did say he used his kohl s cash a coupon of sorts that is generated based on how much a customer purchased in an earlier visit to the store
