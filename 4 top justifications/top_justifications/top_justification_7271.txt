Dan Patrick "got caught not paying his taxes" and "pocketed his employeesâ€™ payroll taxes."
in dewhurst video ad that came public april the narrator said patrick got caught not paying his taxes and pocketed his employees payroll taxes
dewhurst said patrick got caught not paying taxes and pocketed employees payroll taxes
but did he get caught not paying taxes and also pocket employee payroll taxes
dewhurst correct government acted on patrick not paying taxes but records inconclusive on his employees payroll taxes
we see no confirmation though that patrick pocketed employees payroll taxes though such taxes did go unpaid to the government at times
