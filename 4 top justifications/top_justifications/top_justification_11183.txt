The Supreme Court said the individual mandate "is a tax. So it's a tax."
the supreme court has said it s a tax so it s a tax
it is thus a tax for purposes of how the constitution defines a tax
the supreme court found the law constitutional based on congress taxing authority but nowhere in the opinion did roberts say that the individual mandate actually was a tax only that it may reasonably be characterized as a tax and that it is reasonable to construe it as a tax
however when the court looked at whether the mandate was constitutional it used a more expansive definition of the word tax one that includes provisions that are not explicitly labeled taxes but act in similar ways
did the court rule that the individual mandate was a tax or not we received comments from constitutional law experts from across the ideological spectrum
