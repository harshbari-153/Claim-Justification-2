Among Syrian refugees, "there aren't that many women, there aren't that many children."
trump said there are that many women there are that many children among syrian refugees
trump s description of syrian refugees as not being many children and women didn t sound quite right to us so we decided to check out it out
these people are not the same as syrians in registered refugee camps
refugee camps most of whom are women and children
to add another wrinkle to trump s already confusing claims those won t all be syrian refugees but rather refugees from all over the world
