Republican candidate for governor Nathan Deal fought to weaken Georgia's rape shield law.
ad nathan deal tried to weaken rape shield law in
if nathan deal had won his fight to weaken the rape shield law and my niece took the stand she would have been forced to defend what she wore and that she didn t deserve to be raped
to evaluate barnes claims ajc politifact georgia dug up deal failed senate bill from the georgia archives and looked up state and federal rape shield rules that were in effect then
deal who was senate president pro tem at the time sponsored a bill that would have overhauled georgia rules of evidence
but did he actually fight to weaken the rape shield law as the barnes ad said deal said he was actually trying to make the rape shield law conform to federal standards and strengthen it against possible constitutional challenges
