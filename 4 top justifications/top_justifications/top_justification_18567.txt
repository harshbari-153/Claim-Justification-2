"Jim Renacci supports a national sales tax of 23 percent."
jim renacci supports a national sales tax of percent says the union ad which includes comments from outraged citizens condemning the proposal
afscme accuses republican jim renacci of supporting a percent national sales tax
but while the video shows renacci likes a percent national sales tax that s not enough to make afscme s ad completely accurate
what s at issue in the afscme ad isn t the economics of the fair tax proposal rather did renacci really say he favors a national sales tax increase of percent
recognizing the mood benefiting republicans afscme wants a piece of the action accusing renacci of backing a massive tax hike
