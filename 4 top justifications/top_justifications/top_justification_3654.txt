If Fox News' presidential debate rules had been in place during the 1992 election, "Bill Clinton wouldn't have been on the stage."
santorum said that if fox news had applied its rules to a hypothetical democratic primary debate in that clinton would not have been on the stage
fox debate rules would have kept bill clinton off the stage in election rick santorum says
moreover by the time the democratic candidates did debate in clinton was not doing as poorly in the polls as santorum claims
under the fox news rules none of them would qualify to participate in its debate
in a hypothetical sense a debate that included the top of those candidates just barely might have excluded clinton
