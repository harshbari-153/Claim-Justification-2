In the United States, weâ€™ve had "12 years in a row of wages declining."
o malley said that in the united states we ve had years in a row of wages declining
but here s where his phrasing is misleading it s not accurate to say the united states has had years in a row of wages declining
during the interview o malley decried the economic fraying of the american dream saying the united states has had years in a row of wages declining
this makes it sound like wages dropped in lockstep in each of those years
here s where o malley has a point wages were indeed lower in than they were years earlier
