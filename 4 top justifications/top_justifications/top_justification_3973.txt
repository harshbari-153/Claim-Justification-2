"The militaryâ€™s actually been in charge since November 3rd."
later the military s actually been in charge since november when troops yes they checked out the watermark ballots and they said that trump had won over of the vote
there is also no evidence to support the claim that the military has been in charge since the presidential election
in fact an investigation published dec
no the military hasn t been in charge since the presidential election
we aren t sure what the video is referencing when it mentions watermarked ballots but we previously looked into a claim that the trump administration put secret watermarks on official ballots to trick cheating democrats and found it baseless
