Says Jeff Foxworthy wrote a list of examples explaining how "you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots."
and falsely attributed to comedian jeff foxworthy
foxworthy is famous for his you might be a redneck jokes but searching online we couldn t find any credible evidence that he penned this list that touches on abortion muslims and federal debt
if you can get arrested for hunting or fishing without a license but not for entering and remaining in the country illegally you might live in a country that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots
no evidence jeff foxworthy is behind this viral facebook post
rather we found users on web forums crediting someone named fritz edmunds with the list
