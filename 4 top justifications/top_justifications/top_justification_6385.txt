Says 228 House Democrats voted "to allow illegal aliens to have right to vote"
a facebook post said house democrats voted to allow illegal aliens to have right to vote
house dems yes gop no to allow illegal aliens to have right to vote
just because democrats voted against a motion reaffirming that illegal immigrants can t vote doesn t mean they voted to actually allow those immigrants to vote
a misleading social media post suggests that house democrats want to give the right to vote to noncitizens
no house democrats did not vote to allow noncitizens to vote as part of hr
