"SCOTUS overturned the 2020 election."
scotus overturned the election a july facebook post says
and in some cases biden detractors believe the court has overturned the election
in the fall the court is expected to consider the power state legislatures have over elections but this won t have any bearing on the outcome of the election
the supreme court had a sensational term issuing rulings on abortion gun rights and the environment but they didn t weigh in on the presidential election much less overturn it
no the supreme court didn t overturn the election
