Eliminating affirmative action in admissions in Florida led to "more African American and Hispanic kids attending our university system" than before.
bush said that eliminating affirmative action in admissions led to more african american and hispanic kids attending our university system universities than before
it s been some time since bush ended admissions policies so we wondered if more african american and hispanic students are attending state universities now than when affirmative action was in place
florida has more black hispanic university students after ending affirmative action jeb bush says
but through hard work we ended up having a system where there were more african american and hispanic kids attending our university system than prior to the system that was discriminatory
overall enrollment is up because there are more students in the state than there were in and more of them including black and hispanic students are graduating than before
