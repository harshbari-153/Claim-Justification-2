"The Republican presidential nominee hasnâ€™t won women since 1988."
mcghee said the republican presidential nominee hasn t won women since
i think it s important to remember the republican presidential nominee hasn t won women since so this is a very deep problem for the party mcghee said aug
since then no gop candidate has won the women s vote
is it true that no gop nominee candidate in almost three decades has earned more support from women than the democratic nominee
no republican has won the fight for more women s votes since
