Says there's $4 billion in private investment along the streetcar.
there may have been that much money total although it s still not clear how much is directly attributable to the streetcar but it wasn t all private
mayor sam adams city say streetcar attracted billion in private investment
billion in private investment and that doesn t even include projects that may be near the streetcar even if the streetcar isn t the reason why the development is there
so it s hard to say whether that much investment would have happened without the streetcar
billion of development within three blocks of the streetcar
