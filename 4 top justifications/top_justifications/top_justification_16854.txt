Says when Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts was 47th in job creation
our ruling it s correct that massachusetts ranked of in job creation on romney s watch
you know when he was governor massachusetts was in job creation so we need better than that in a president
but the fact that barack obama is still leading slightly in new hampshire despite the fact that that mitt romney has a home there that he was governor of massachusetts our neighboring state i think is a reflection of people s remembering what romney did in massachusetts
labor department statistics showing massachusetts ranked fourth from last in the country in jobs growth from january to january romney s time in office
politifact has had heard this claim about bay state job creation under romney more than once
