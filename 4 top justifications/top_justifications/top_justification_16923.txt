when you ca find gas remember who executively ordered the keystone pipeline to close a facebook post read on may
a facebook post suggests that shortages of gasoline are due to an executive order closing the keystone pipeline
first biden s order didn t close the keystone pipeline it s still operating
third the gasoline shortages are due to a problem with the operator of the colonial pipeline not a lack of crude oil or anything connected with keystone or keystone xl
no the east coast gas shortage isn t related to the keystone pipeline or biden s order
