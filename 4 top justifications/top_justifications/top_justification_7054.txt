there are legitimate and widespread anomalies said kloppenburg a state justice department attorney and widespread questions about the conduct of this election most visibly in waukesha county but also in counties around the state
given the outrage over the waukesha incident kloppenburg seems on solid ground suggesting that there are widespread questions about the election
in addition to the waukesha situation kloppenburg at the news conference cited an undervote in milwaukee and racine ballot shortages and long lines in fond du lac and several other municipalities and changes in the unofficial vote totals in winnebago county
waukesha county s situation was rare but it is only one county and the big discrepancy there has already been cleared up according to state elections officials
discrepancies in unofficial results it s clear the big waukesha county vote tally error on election night was unusual
