If President Obama signs the Copenhagen climate change treaty, he "will sign your freedom, your democracy, and your prosperity away forever â€” and neither you nor any subsequent government you may elect would have any power whatsoever to take it back again."
for instance the united states signed the kyoto protocol on climate change the predecessor to the agreement being negotiated in copenhagen but never ratified it due to opposition in the senate
third it hard to envision anything coming out of copenhagen that would change the united states bedrock principles of freedom and democracy
instead we stick to analyzing monckton claim that an agreement coming out of the copenhagen talks would one sign away american sovereignty and two be irreversible
now we look at monckton argument that the copenhagen talks could eventually produce something that eats away at american sovereignty
but in the next few weeks unless you stop it your president will sign your freedom your democracy and your prosperity away forever and neither you nor any subsequent government you may elect would have any power whatsoever to take it back again
