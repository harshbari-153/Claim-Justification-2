"Should Democrats get their way, every income tax bracket will increase on Jan. 1, 2011. Every single one."
he said the american people deserve to know that should democrats get their way every income tax bracket will increase on january
do democrats want every tax bracket to rise as pence suggests in a word no
will every tax bracket increase the answer is yes unless congress takes action
while pence would have been entirely accurate to say if the democrats fail to extend the expiring tax cuts all tax brackets will increase he did
pence is right that every tax bracket will go up if the law is not extended
