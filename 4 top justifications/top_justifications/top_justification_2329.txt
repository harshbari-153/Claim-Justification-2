A judge's order means there's a "Constitution exemption zone" if you live "within 100 miles of the United States border."
a facebook post said a judge order means there a constitution exemption zone if you live within miles of the united states border
if you live within miles of the united states border then you in what is being called the exemption zone read the post on a page called world must wake up
there is a border search exception which long predates the district court ruling that allows officials at or near borders to search people and their possessions without obtaining warrants
politifact wanted to dig deeper into the notion of a constitution exemption zone
today the exception for searches near borders is a part of the immigration and nationality act
