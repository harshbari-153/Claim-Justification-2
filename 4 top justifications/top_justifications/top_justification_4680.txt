"A California health care CEO is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs."
a california health care ceo is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs
an ad against ohio s issue ballot initiative said a california health care ceo is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs
i think calling him a health care ceo would be disingenuous if it were banal but considering they are in the process of character assassination then it is wrong that drug company ceos are spending money from excessive profits to try to label him as one of them said dennis willard a spokesman for ohio taxpayers for lower drug prices
the idea is that it would lower the state s health care costs
his organization deals with health care and he is indeed its top executive but the ad makes it seem as though he represents the drug industry which is actually true of the ad makers
