thirty million americans including a lot of people in florida are going to be able to get health care next year because of that law
our ruling obama said thirty million americans including a lot of people in florida are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law
those are the provisions of the law expected to give millions of americans access to health insurance and thus health care
the congressional budget office estimates that next year only about million more americans will gain health insurance
well look keep in mind a million young people around the country have health care that did have it before because they can stay on their parents health care plan
