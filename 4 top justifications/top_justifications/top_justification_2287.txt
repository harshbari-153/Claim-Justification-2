Millions of Americans are "paying more and getting less" under Obamacare.
americans for prosperity said millions are paying more and getting less under obamacare
americans for prosperity claims people are getting less at a higher cost under obamacare
we found it strange that the ad claimed that people are getting less under the affordable care act
and millions of people have lost their health insurance millions of people can t see their own doctors and millions are paying more and getting less
at worst they re paying more to get more though in many cases they re actually paying less
