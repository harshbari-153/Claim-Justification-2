Says she heard more than 2,400 cases as a Wisconsin appeals court judge
our rating roggensack s tv ad says she heard more than cases as a wisconsin appeals court judge
as she speaks words appear on the screen supreme court cases heard over then appellate cases heard over
a large majority of the cases she takes credit for hearing are the type in which staff attorneys not the judges write the final legal ruling under judicial supervision
the count includes minor and major cases and a large number in which the judge s decision is written up by staff attorneys
but there s another way to do this use the court s internal system to come up with a more precise count of cases she handled rather than a pure estimate
