Says U.S. left 33 Black Hawks to the Taliban, which has more than "85%" of all countries.
military left black hawks that are now part of the taliban s new arsenal and that the group now has more of the helicopters than of all countries
however as politifact previously reported and as banks office acknowledged it unclear how many of the black hawks are now in the hands of the taliban
his claim about how the taliban s stock of black hawks compares to other countries appears to be accurate
that means if the taliban has taken even one black hawk they would have more black hawks than of the world
meanwhile one blog run by independent military analysts reports the taliban seized black hawks but that only six are operable
