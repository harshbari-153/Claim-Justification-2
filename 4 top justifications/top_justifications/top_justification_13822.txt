"One-third of the gasoline is purchased by out-of-state people" in Virginia
state richard saslaw says in virginia of the gasoline is purchased by people
the logical explanation for the different trajectories he said is that a large portion of the gas is being purchased by visitors to virginia
our ruling saslaw the senate minority leader said of the gasoline bought in virginia is purchased by motorists
we see lots of cars with other states plates on virginia s roads but do those visitors really account for of the state s gasoline sales we asked saslaw who once owned service stations in northern virginia to back his claim that drivers buy of the gas in the state
so the fuel use by vehicles registered in virginia increased by percent over that time
