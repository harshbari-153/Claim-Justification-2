"We have a mayor in D.C. who formed a commission with recommendations. Her recommendation is: Take down the Washington Monument, close up the Lincoln Monument."
her recommendation is take down the washington monument close up the lincoln monument
her recommendation is take down the washington monument close up the lincoln monument
a report from a working group she established in july did urge her to encourage the federal government to remove relocate or contextualize the washington monument not the lincoln memorial
but the mayor had the references to federal monuments deleted from the report and her office quickly clarified that the commission s call was for contextualizing not removing
trump s comment mischaracterized the recommendations of a city commission that spent the summer reviewing the namesakes of more than schools buildings parks streets public spaces and monuments throughout the nation s capital
