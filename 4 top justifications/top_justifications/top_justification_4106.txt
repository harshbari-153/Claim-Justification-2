"Mayor Fung wants to punish our children's education by removing 12 million dollars from current funding to pay for his private charter school. Your taxes would increase by between 6 and 8 percent per year."
mayor fung wants to punish our children education by removing million from current funding to pay for his private charter school
tomlins characterized the mayoral academy as fung private charter school said it would have removed million from current funding and would have increased taxes between and percent per year
and to threaten that the mayoral academy would have increased taxes by percent to percent each year when state law makes it difficult to impose such big tax hikes is ridiculous
pulling million out the cranston school system sounded bad enough but the prospect of a tax increase of percent to percent was even more frightening
we asked tomlins why he referred to the academy as a private school when accountability would lie with the mayor any cranston child could apply for the lottery and parents would have to pay tuition
