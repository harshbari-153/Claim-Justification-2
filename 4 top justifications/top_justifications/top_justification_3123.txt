"Drunk" Nancy Pelosi "was removed from the House floor for cursing at Republicans."
fact check was a drunk pelosi removed from the house floor for cursing at republicans alongside is a photo of pelosi walking with two men and a woman near her perhaps on the house floor
the post says a story circulating online claims that after pelosi cursed at republicans house sergeant at arms joe barron forcibly removed her from the floor and that congressmen who were present confirmed the incident
imagine how intense the news coverage would be if a drunken cursing member of congress had to be forcibly removed from the house floor
claim of nancy pelosi drunk on house floor is fabricated
even more so if the offender were house speaker nancy pelosi
