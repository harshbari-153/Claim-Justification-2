Under the Iran deal: "If Israel attacks Iran … we’re supposed to be on Iran’s side."
trump said that under the iran deal if israel attacks iran we are supposed to be on iran s side
to defend iran if israel or any other country tries to undermine iran s nuclear facilities
trump added if israel attacks iran i think of course this wouldn t happen it wouldn t happen with me with obama you never know but we re supposed to be on iran s side if this happens
the iran deal
rubio if israel conducts an airstrike against a physical facility does this deal the way i read it does it require us to help iran protect and respond to that threat
