John Boehner said the jobs of "teachers and nurses and police officers and firefighters" are "'government jobs' that weren't worth saving."
he said that boehner did not say that government jobs worth saving
he does not mention the professions of teachers nurses police or firefighters and he never said that government jobs were worth saving
obama says boehner does think jobs for teachers police firefighters are worth saving
so boehner did call the jobs the bill aimed to save government jobs
but the republican leader did not say government jobs were worth saving
