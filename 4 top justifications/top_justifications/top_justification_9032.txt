Says "the New York Times can write a story that they know is false" yet "they can't basically be sued."
i think it very unfair when the new york times can write a story that they know is false that they virtually told me they know it false and i say why do you pull the story and they say we not going to do that because they ca basically be sued
trump said the new york times can write a story that they know is false yet they ca basically be sued
one immediate problem with trump s assertion is that he said a publication can t be sued for publishing an article known to be false
and they can certainly win in the scenario trump cited if the new york times knowingly published something false and defamatory
trump s comments that media basically can t be sued if they write a story that they know as false struck us as inaccurate and when we checked with experts in media law we found that current law already covers the situation trump describes
