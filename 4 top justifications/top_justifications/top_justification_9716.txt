Says Donald Trump's position isÂ "to roll back all" of the financial regulations passed after the financial crisis.
warren said trump wants to roll back all of those regulations on wall street banks
trump never said he wanted to make it easier for banks to cheat people but he has said he wants to roll back regulations on wall street
while we don t know what trump s plan would look like exactly he certainly wants to scrap a lot of the law
it might not be right to say all of those regulations but trump himself has been unclear on that point
he has said hey guys if i get in i going to roll back all of those regulations because it makes it too hard for banks to cheat people warren said in a june interview on the view
