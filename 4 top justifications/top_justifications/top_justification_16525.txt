"Go to antifa.com and it takes you to Biden’s White House! … Just a slap in the face."
attention go to antifa dot com the correct way and it takes you to biden whitehouse reads a popular post on facebook
what is going on i know it went to his campaign but to put wh on it just a slap in the face
one day after biden was sworn in as the president the domain began pulling up the white house s official website whitehouse
the post is partially accurate the domain does redirect to the white house s website but in implying that biden s white house is involved it leaves out important details or takes things out of context
we did not hear back from the white house about the current redirect but biden s campaign denied any association with the previous antifa
