Ukrainian "attack destroys skyscraper in Moscow."
horrible attack destroys skyscraper in moscow
no a ukrainian attack didn t destroy a moscow skyscraper
while the headline describes a fire at a huge moscow tower block as a putin nightmare it doesn t say the incident was an attack or connected to the country s invasion of ukraine
giant explosion in moscow a description of the video says
there s the war in ukraine following russia s invasion of the country and then there are skirmishes to control the narrative
