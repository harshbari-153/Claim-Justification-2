"Six years after unionization, 20,000 fewer children in Illinois were being served by the Child Care and Development Fund program."
one of parrish s points caught our eye six years after unionization fewer children in illinois were being served by the child care and development fund program
parrish said fewer children were served in an illinois program subsidized by the federal government after a labor union began representing providers
contacted by politifact rhode island parrish said union involvement prompted providers to leave illinois and program so fewer children were served
that was very close to the decrease in the number of children served by all programs
a monthly average of children were served in illinois by the federally subsidized program
