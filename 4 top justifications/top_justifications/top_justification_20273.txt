Says Mitt Romney and George Allen "would overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk."
wade and would that allow states to end abortion romney and allen on roe first we ve got to state the obvious neither a president nor a senator can overturn a supreme court decision
planned parenthood says mitt romney and george allen overturn roe wade and allow states to end safe legal abortion
our ruling a planned parenthood mailer in virginia claims that mitt romney and george allen would overturn roe v
so let s reprise the ifs if romney and allen win and if romney gets the chance to replace a liberal justice and if allen and other senators confirm a justice who supports overturning roe and if that new justice creates a majority on the court willing to revisit roe and if there s an appropriate case for the supreme court to review and if the court decides to fully overturn roe returning abortion regulations to the states then a state legislature could vote to end safe legal abortion even in cases of rape incest or when a woman life is at risk
we wondered would romney and allen overturn roe vs
