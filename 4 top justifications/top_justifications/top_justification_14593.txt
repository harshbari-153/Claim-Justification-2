Says Mark Kirk "called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans" and "was apparently fine with Trump’s #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation."
duckworth tweeted kirk who called for the mass arrest of african americans was apparently fine with trump s stilltooracist call for mass deportation
is it true that kirk called for the mass arrest of and second that kirk had no objection to trump s call for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants we checked the record
and as for duckworth s claim that kirk was apparently fine with trump s call for mass deportation
what about kirk on deportation
still not only does duckworth tweet take what kirk said out of context it also implies he supported the general mass arrest of even though kirk never mentioned race or used the term during his interview with fox chicago
