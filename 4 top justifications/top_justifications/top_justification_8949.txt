The departments of Commerce, Education and Energy and the EPA saw their spending increase by between 130 percent and 219 percent between 2008 and 2010.
these numbers while rising are much more modest than the figures hensarling cites an percent increase for education a percent increase for energy and a percent increase for epa
commerce up percent compared to hensarling s percent education up percent compared to hensarling s percent energy up percent compared to hensarling s percent epa up percent compared to hensarling s percent it s clear that for every department cited hensarling s percentage increase is three to four times higher than what the figure would be for actual outlays
jeb hensarling offered budgetary statistics designed to show massive spending increases by federal agencies in recent years
well then i trust that when you add in the stimulus the commerce department has grown percent from to that with the stimulus epa has grown
as a result spending by the department in any year divisible by is much higher than it is for the rest of the decade
