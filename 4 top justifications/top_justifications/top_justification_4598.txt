Says Bill Daley, as part of former Gov. Bruce Raunerâ€™s transition team, wrote "the blueprint" for record Springfield gridlock.
susana mendoza s ad says that as part of the governor s transition team bill daley wrote the blueprint for what she calls rauner s four years of crisis and destruction
but her claim that daley somehow paved the way for the role rauner played in the state s protracted budget impasse lacks substance
daley helped produce a report that outlined general priorities for rauner s incoming administration on a long list of issues
after bruce rauner s transition team and writing the blueprint for the governor s four years of crisis and destruction he stood by and remained silent it reads simultaneously chiding daley for failing to protest rauner s actions in office and accusing him of charting the course for the now departed republican
mendoza claim that daley laid the framework for rauner s role in the state s protracted budget impasse boils down to a broad accusation of guilt by association
