The House passed a pay-as-you-go rule that said, "If you wanted to have an investment, an entitlement, etc., you had to pay for it."
our majority made paygo the rule of the house that if you wanted to have an investment an entitlement etc
you had to pay for it
the paygo that pelosi comment refers to the one instituted in was a house rule that governs how bills are taken up in the house
you had to pay for it contains some aspects that are misleading
the rule approved in and still in force effectively bars the house from taking up a bill if it would on balance increase projected deficits
