"And the #jerseycomeback keeps rolling! Thanks to @GovChristie NJ now has lowest corruption risk of any state."
and the jerseycomeback keeps rolling thanks to govchristie nj now has lowest corruption risk of any state according to the march tweet from the new jersey republican state committee
our ruling referring to a nationwide investigation comparing states for their risk of corruption new jersey s republican party claimed in a march tweet thanks to govchristie nj now has lowest corruption risk of any state
new jersey gop credit chris christie for new jersey having the lowest risk of corruption in the nation
you would be hard pressed to find anyone in new jersey or the entire country for that matter who doubts governor christie s commitment or actual record on prosecuting political corruption
but politifact new jersey found that the regulations behind new jersey s highest scores were put in place before christie became governor
