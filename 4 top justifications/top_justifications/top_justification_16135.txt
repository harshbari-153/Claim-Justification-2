a facebook post claimed pelosi said congress shall not vote remotely because it is not secure while also saying that americans should all vote for president by mail
one caption reads congress shall not vote remotely because it is not secure
no nancy pelosi does not oppose remote voting by house members
pelosi said any changes to the requirement that house members vote in person are a long way off the san francisco chronicle reported saying that pelosi said we re not there yet and we re not going to be there no matter how many letters somebody sends in with all the respect in the world for that
pelosi is a prominent supporter of letting voters cast ballots by mail a process opposed by president donald trump who claims it is open to fraud
