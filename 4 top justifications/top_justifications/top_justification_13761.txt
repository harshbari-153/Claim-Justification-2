the ad narration begins over half a million pennsylvanians unemployed and what congressman joe sestak done he voted to gut medicare slashing benefits for pennsylvania seniors
the ad also says on screen that sestak voted to cut medicare by billion citing his vote in favor of the democratic health care bill that was signed into law earlier this year by president barack obama
so looking back at the ad claims do the medicare advantage changes gut medicare or jeopardize access to care for millions we think gut is an overheated way of putting it
in the visuals the ad says reducing benefits for seniors a statistic it attributes to the kaiser family foundation a group that studies health care policy
in addition other parts of the new law expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of medicare less expensive for patients
