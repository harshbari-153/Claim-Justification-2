Says an amendment specifying when military members may use deadly force "does nothing to change existing rules of engagement for American service members."
in summary cicilline said mica s amendment would do nothing to change existing rules of engagement for service members
he said that he joined other democrats and republicans in voting against the amendment in may because it does nothing to change existing rules of engagement for american service members
furthermore when they are instructed on the rules of engagement our troops are explicitly told that nothing prevents them from using deadly force to defend themselves
we wondered whether cicilline was right when he said the amendment would do nothing to change existing rules
the purpose of this amendment was to have the military give them troops a little more leeway to protect themselves
