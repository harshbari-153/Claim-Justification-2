"Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism.'"
we did a word search of obama public statements and could not find that obama has used the phrase war on terrorism as president though he said it numerous times as a candidate
obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices and you may agree or disagree with them but the bottom line is that obama has chosen not to use the phrase war on terrorism
and except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase war on terror obama has generally employed different words
and early in his presidency obama used the phrase war on terror but only a couple of times
as many have noted the president does not describe this as a on terrorism
