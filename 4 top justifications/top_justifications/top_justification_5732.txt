"If you're a … wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are … lower than they've been since the 1950s."
if you a if you are a wealthy ceo or a hedge fund manager in america right now your taxes are lower than they have ever been
even so when obama said that if you a wealthy ceo or a hedge fund manager in america right now your taxes are lower than they been since the he close their tax rates are at or near the lows for the years elapsed since then
first hedge fund managers who were specifically cited by obama typically don t pay taxes on their income the same way other americans do
assuming you re talking about the ordinary income a ceo or a hedge fund manager earns a key assumption which we ll discuss in more detail later obama is pretty close to right but not percent
meanwhile the rates that are used to tax carried interest for managers have been at historical lows since
