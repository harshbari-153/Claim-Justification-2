"There is no law that deals specifically with the term ‘partial-birth abortion.’"
becerra said there is no law that deals specifically with the term abortion
becerra again as i said there is no law that deals specifically with the term abortion
one of the things becerra said caught the attention of advocates that there is no law that deals specifically with the term abortion
during the hearing secretary becerra clarified that partial birth abortion is not a medically recognized term
again with due respect there is no medical term like abortion so i d probably have to ask you what you mean by that to describe what is allowed by the law
