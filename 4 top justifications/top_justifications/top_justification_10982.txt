Says the high-speed rail project provides "short-term jobs."
scott said the rail project provides jobs
but of those jobs more than percent are confined to just two years during the rail construction and
that leaves just direct and indirect jobs created as a result of the operation of the train that are truly permanent
fdot concluded that the rail line would create a total of direct and indirect jobs over the construction of the system and another total jobs once the line is in operation
gov rick scott says rail jobs wo last long
