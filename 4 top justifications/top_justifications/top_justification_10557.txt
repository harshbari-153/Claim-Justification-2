A Republican housing finance reform bill "would eliminate a personâ€™s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages."
moore stated that a republican bill to largely privatize the nation s housing finance system would eliminate a person s ability to obtain and mortgages
the bill moore continued would eliminate a person s ability to obtain and mortgages the cornerstone of our housing finance system
the national association of home builders for example said the bill would greatly limit homeownership for many qualified americans and the credit union national association said it feared the bill could not ensure continuation of mortgage products
so moore doesn t have hard evidence that the path bill would eliminate the ability of a person to get a traditional mortgage that remains to be seen
gop bill would put traditional home mortgages out of reach for masses gwen moore says
