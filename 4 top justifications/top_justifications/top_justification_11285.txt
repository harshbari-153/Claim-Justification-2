Says Gov. Scott Walker has "led people to believe that if Wisconsin doesn’t implement a (health-care) exchange, Obamacare doesn’t happen here."
walker he said has led people to believe that if wisconsin doesn t implement an exchange obamacare doesn t happen here
erpenbach said walker has led people to believe that if wisconsin doesn t implement an exchange obamacare doesn t happen here
june after the supreme court upheld much of the law walker issued a statement saying that wisconsin will not take any action to implement obamacare
in that statement walker directly linked the exchange decision to stopping obamacare in wisconsin and not committing to it
while there is some fuzziness about what could happen in the future erpenbach s claim was entirely about the past that walker had led residents to believe if the state did not create an exchange obamacare would not be implemented here
