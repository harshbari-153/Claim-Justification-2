Says Jeff Wentworth, bending the rules, "has used $211,743.96 in campaign contributions to lease luxury cars."
political group says jeff wentworth bending the rules spent nearly in campaign funds leasing luxury cars
our ruling wentworth spent some in campaign funds leasing vehicles as the pac says
also blakemore said wentworth s reported campaign contributions and expenditures fail to show the senator regularly reimbursing his campaign for times he used the leased vehicles for personal purposes
in campaign contributions to lease luxury cars including the lexus he currently drives
then again such leases are allowed if the vehicles are used for officeholder or campaign purposes which is how wentworth camp says he uses the leased vehicles
