"The Dutch (Afrikaners) were" in South Africa "first."
actually the dutch afrikaners we re there first
clearly the story of south africa turns on the dutch and the british taking land from the people who were there first
coulter said that dutch settlers were in south africa before black people
beyond the western areas of south africa where the dutch influence was greatest other groups predated the colonizers by over years
groups farmed in the eastern regions of modern south africa perhaps as much as a millennium before the dutch arrived
