Says Donald Trump made a lot of money from outsourcing jobs thanks to NAFTA "but never, ever raised his voice against it when Congress was considering it."
brown said trump made a lot of money from outsourcing jobs thanks to nafta but never ever raised his voice against it when congress was considering it
a couple of things first of all brown went on all i ve heard with donald trump the guy who made a lot of money from outsourcing jobs to china to mexico to turkey to slovenia to other countries i m forgetting right now the guy that made a lot of money from that is now against this trade policy but never ever raised his voice against it when congress was considering it
yes trump has benefitted financially from trade deals like nafta
in other words brown s account of trump outsourcing production of his ventures checks out
trump already had the type of fame that draws cameras for walking out to get the mail so if the businessman were to weigh in on nafta he d be quoted
