"What I have done -- and this is unprecedented ... is I've said to each agency ... 'look at regulations that are already on the books and if they don't make sense, let's get rid of them.'"
let go backwards and look at regulations that are already on the books and if they do make sense let get rid of them
what i have done and this is unprecedented by the way no administration has done this before is i said to each agency just look at current regulations or do just look at future regulations regulations that we proposing
in fact he claimed his administration was taking a look at existing regulations to eliminate ones that do make sense
for that reason i ask that each of your agencies set aside a period beginning today to evaluate existing regulations and programs and to identify and accelerate action on initiatives that will eliminate any unnecessary regulatory burden or otherwise promote economic growth
