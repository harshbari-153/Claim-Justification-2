he said that obama said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males but he was slightly off in that the president spoke about all and whites not just males
that obama said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males
now to the second part of clarke s claim whether it s a lie because there is no data that black males are two times more likely than white males to be shot by a law enforcement officer
he said it again the other day when he said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males
