Said Sen. Thom Tillis "co-sponsored a bill that not only provided amnesty, but provided a clear path to citizenship for illegal immigrants."
he a bill that not only provided amnesty but provided a clear path to citizenship for illegal immigrants tucker said on the radio show
tillis sponsored the legislation as a more immigration solution for that group of immigrants as compared to the bipartisan dream act or president obama s daca policy
tucker argued that tillis succeed act was because it gave illegal immigrants a clear path to citizenship
he is correct that the bill would help pave the way for citizenship for a select number of immigrants in the country illegally but it only concerns those who were minors when they first entered the country
despite the many restrictions specified in the succeed act carter wrenn a spokesman for tucker said that it still qualifies as amnesty because amnesty is a pathway to citizenship
