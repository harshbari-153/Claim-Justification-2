A recent on-air protest canâ€™t be real because "there are no live on air television broadcasts in Russia. None. Ever."
a facebook post said that a russian journalist s protest during a state tv broadcast couldn t be real because there are no live on air television broadcasts in russia
it couldn t have been real they say because there are no live tv broadcasts in russia
because there are no live broadcasts the post said russia staged the protest to distract attention and to get people talking about the good russians
there are no live on air television broadcasts in russia
news and other programs are broadcast live on russian television despite claims otherwise
