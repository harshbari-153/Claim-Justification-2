Sotomayor "ruled against the white firefighter — Ricci and other white firefighters — just on the basis that she thought women and minorities should be given a preference because of their skin color and because of the history of discrimination in the past. The law was totally disregarded."
she ruled against the white firefighter ricci and other white firefighters just on the basis that she thought women and minorities should be given a preference because of their skin color and because of the history of discrimination in the past limbaugh said
that sotomayor ruled against white firefighter ricci and other white firefighters is undisputed
but this is a very complex legal case and limbaugh misleads when he boils down the ruling by sotomayor and two other appeals court judges saying it was made just on the basis that she thought women and minorities should be given a preference because of their skin color and because of the history of discrimination in the past
rush limbaugh says sotomayor disregarded law to rule against white firefighters
nor did sotomayor panel or the district court ever suggest that the city ought to give preferential treatment to women and minorities
