Under the Graham-Cassidy health insurance bill, in "states like Maine, Virginia, Florida, Missouri, there will be billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage for those in those states who have been passed by by Obamacare."
cassidy said that under his bill in states like maine virginia florida missouri there will be billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage for those in those states who have been passed by by obamacare
in states like maine virginia florida missouri there will be billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage for those in those states who have been passed by by obamacare
if these projections are to be believed and it s worth emphasizing that they are only projections by one policy group then the four states cassidy cited would not necessarily see billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage under the bill over the long term
under the bill cassidy said more people will have coverage and we protect those with conditions
in addition the affordable care act as passed would have expanded medicaid in every state
