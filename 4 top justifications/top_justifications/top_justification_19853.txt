Says Joel Osteen Ministries charges people for prayers via a "prayer request account."
no joel osteen ministries doesn t charge people money for prayer requests
now a screenshot is circulating on social media of what appears to be a woman asking for prayers for her marriage on the facebook page of joel osteen s ministries only to be told that she needs to purchase a prayer request account
which will give you access to prayer requests per month
unfortunately your joel osteen prayer request account has not been activated
it s not real the facebook page pictured is not the actual joel osteen ministries account and has since been deleted after fact checkers and osteen s lakewood church reported that the account was a intended to make it appear as if osteen exchanges prayers for money
