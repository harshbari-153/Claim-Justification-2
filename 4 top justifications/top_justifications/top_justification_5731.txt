In discussing the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, "Ms. Rice did say 'a terrorist attack.' It’s not that she put the whole thing on the video."
technically rice did mention extremism in most of her appearances but she certainly wasn t saying that the benghazi attack was a act of terror
sunday shows rice said terrorist attack and didn t put the entire blame on protests related to an youtube video
but when asked to offer her assessment of what happened rice stressed protests related to the video and downplayed connections to terrorism
in those interviews rice blamed reaction to a video and ruled out a act of terror
