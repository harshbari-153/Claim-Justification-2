Pennsylvania officials are "attempting to silence voters" by sending them letters that say theyâ€™ve been exposed to COVID-19 and "must remain quarantined and not vote in person on Election Day."
the facebook post claims that letters from pennsylvania s department of health order people to quarantine and not vote in person on election day
the post continued the letter states that they ve been exposed to no proof given and as such must remain quarantined and not vote in person on election day
on the eve of election day a warning started to spread on social media that the state of pennsylvania was undermining voters
the letters don t mention voting but the rules of quarantine do prohibit someone from showing up at the polls on election day
pennsylvania residents under quarantine can cast an emergency absentee ballot
