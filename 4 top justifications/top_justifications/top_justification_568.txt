Says "Did you know that if you accepted the District's proposal today you would have NO pay increase for 4 years? Seven years of frozen wages = Disrespect."
did you know that if you accepted the district proposal today you would have no pay increase for years years of frozen wages disrespect reads the april bargaining brief newsletter for members
the analysis politifact oregon can t weigh in on whether this amounts to disrespect by the district but we can fact check whether the district s proposal amounts to four years of no pay increase and seven years of frozen wages for teachers
its second assertion of seven years of frozen wages is false
there s a bit of truth in the assertion some teachers will have no pay increase for four years if this offer is accepted
it is true that teachers who have topped out would have no pay increase for four years under the district s offer
