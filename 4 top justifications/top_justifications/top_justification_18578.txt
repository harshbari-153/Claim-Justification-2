starbucks exec didn t say she dislikes white people
the facebook post claims that starbucks ceo has admitted to disliking white people basing its claim on a cnn interview with brewer
for one thing the executive mentioned in one post rosalind brewer is the chief operating officer and group president of starbucks not the ceo
in a cnn interview she expressed a desire for diversity in the workplace and corporate leadership she never said anything to suggest she has a problem with white people
