A provision in the health care reform bill for end-of-life counseling for seniors is not "entirely voluntary."
after wide denunciation including here of sarah palin claims last week that the proposed health care reform bill would create death panels the former alaska governor again went to her facebook page to answer the critics and reassert her claim that counseling authorized in the house version of the health plan is not entirely voluntary
as palin says the provision authorizes advanced care planning consultations for senior citizens on medicare every five years and more often there is a significant change in the health condition of the individual
the bill would in fact authorize medicare to reimburse doctors who provide this kind of counseling
it turns out that i guess this arose out of a provision in one of the house bills that allowed medicare to reimburse people for consultations about care setting up living wills the availability of hospice etc
fred thompson on july and said congress would make it mandatory absolutely require that every five years people in medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner
