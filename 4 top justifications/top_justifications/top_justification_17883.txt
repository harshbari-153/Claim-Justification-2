"Large phone companies and their trade association have hired 35 registered lobbyists to influence and pass SB 271 (deregulation legislation)."
in the sixth paragraph the advocates levied this claim large phone companies and their trade association have hired registered lobbyists to influence and pass sb
so where does that leave us as we call for the a coalition of consumers looking to stop legislation deregulating the phone industry in ohio said large phone companies and their trade association have hired registered lobbyists to influence and pass the legislation
so while the number of phone company lobbyists is about right what about the rest of aarp s claim that the lobbyists were hired to influence and pass sb
but a quick check of the same lobbying database shows that at the beginning of long before sb was on the scene the same five companies plus the ohio telecom association employed lobbyists
that implies that the lobbyists were specifically hired to get sb though the legislature
