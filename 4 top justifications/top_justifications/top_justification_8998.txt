"Thereâ€™s actually been more subpoenas issued by the (U.S. House) majority than bills passed."
the ridiculous thing about this is there s actually been more subpoenas issued by the majority than bills passed
wittman said there s actually been more subpoenas issued by the majority than bills passed
etienne also pointed out that during president bill clinton s administration republicans in the majority issued more than subpoenas
but the claim the claim wittman s spokesperson says the congressman was trying to make that house democrats are responsible for more subpoenas than bills passed into law is also misleading since it compares two very different processes
while some republicans specified that the times article counted congressional subpoenas against house bills that were ultimately signed into law wittman was less precise instead comparing subpoenas issued to bills passed
