"(Mary) Burke was a senior member of the Doyle administration that left Wisconsin with 130,000 fewer jobs."
it s answer burke was a senior member of the doyle administration that left wisconsin with fewer jobs and a billion budget shortfall
the republican governors association charged that burke was a senior member of the doyle administration that left wisconsin with fewer jobs
employment also rose in the narrower time frame when burke worked for doyle over parts of his two terms
beyond that burke worked for doyle as commerce secretary over parts of both his terms but not nearly for the entire period
there s something for the rga to hang on to here though in that burke was a holdover member of doyle s administration for a small part of a second term during which more than jobs were lost in four years
