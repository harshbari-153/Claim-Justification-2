The daughter of a Donald Trump appointee posed as an El Paso shooting victim in a photo with the president.
no the daughter of a trump appointee didn t pose as an el paso or dayton shooting victim
wasn t it sweet of her to pose as a victim in el paso with uncle donny
the second is of ivanka trump standing with her arm around a girl s shoulder
the text says this little girl is emma breier daughter of former trump appointee kimberly breier
she is an adult though not a little girl as the facebook post suggests and there is no evidence that she is a crisis actor much less the daughter of a trump appointee
