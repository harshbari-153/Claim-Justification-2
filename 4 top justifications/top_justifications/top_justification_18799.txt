There "are not cuts to Medicaid" in the GOP health care proposals.
conway said that republicans are not cutting the medicaid program
these are not cuts to medicaid george conway said on this week on june
however the proposals include policy changes that will leave fewer people eligible for medicaid
to first vet conway s statement that there are no cuts to medicaid we need to begin with a few basic numbers
but in the case of the gop health care bill there are indeed cuts that go beyond dollars spent
