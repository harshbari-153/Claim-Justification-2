"There are no tax increases in this debt limit bill. Period."
tweeted there are no tax increases in this debt limit bill
eric cantor said there are no tax increases in this debt limit bill period
it true that there are no tax increases written directly into the bill
contained no explicit tax increases or revenue raisers
still the debt committee has the power to propose tax increases if a majority of its members feel it is appropriate and if congress approves those recommendations they would become law
