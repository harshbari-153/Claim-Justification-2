asked about asylum seekers in camps in mexico biden said this is the first time ever you had to seek asylum in a third country
this is the first time ever you ve had to seek asylum in a third country
politifact decided to biden on whether it was true that asylum seekers for the first time ever had to seek asylum in a third country
rather asylum seekers have to request protection in the first of the two countries they arrived in unless they qualify for an exception
it s the first time that the united states has had a program like remain in mexico in which people who submit asylum claims in the united states are not allowed to be in the country during that process and instead are sent to wait in another country said susan fratzke a policy analyst with migration policy institute
