swalwell s claim has two components first he said the law bans abortion before most women even know that they re pregnant
he says a ban prohibits abortion before most women know that they are pregnant but there isn t any research that conclusively says that s correct
legal experts also suspect that as conservatives pursue new abortion legislation heartbeat restrictions are among the likeliest to end up in front of the supreme court
swalwell s claim is an argument we ve heard often about the abortion ban
