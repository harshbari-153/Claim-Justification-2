$50,000. That's what every child owes today because Washington politicians have run up a huge spending tab and left our kids the bill."
that what every child owes today because washington politicians have run up a huge spending tab and left our kids the bill
but like every other child in the country they re already facing thousands of dollars of federal debt according to the congressman
the congressman said that each child owes to the debt
but taking a step back as the congressman tries to illustrate the weight of the debt his numbers are on target as long as they are spread across the entire population at this moment in time
what s more since no one is collecting payment today it s difficult to say what share each child or each person will bear of the national debt
