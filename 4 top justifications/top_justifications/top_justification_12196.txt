Says Ohio Treasurer Josh "Mandel first claimed bank fraud in June 2010 but did nothing for more than a year while raising money for his (Republican) Senate campaign."
the ohio democratic party s claim mandel first claimed bank fraud in june but did nothing for more than a year while raising money for his senate campaign collapses under scrutiny
of interest are the two core contentions that mandel claimed bank fraud in june and did nothing until now
ohio democratic party says josh mandel accused banks of fraud but waited a year to take action
politifact ohio decided to home in on the overarching theme of the party s news release which was conveyed in the document s subtitle mandel first claimed bank fraud in june but did nothing for more than a year while raising money for his senate campaign
it is incorrect and misleading to say mandel claimed bank fraud against bny mellon and state street when he focused his public statements solely on state street and clearly attributed them to the investigation in california
