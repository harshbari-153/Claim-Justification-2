"It was Dan Sullivan who wrote a bill to cut Alaskans out of those decisions" about where they can hunt and fish.
put alaska first pac said in a television ad that sullivan wrote a bill to cut alaskans out of decisions about where citizens can hunt and fish
the ad then cuts to a narrator who says but it was dan sullivan who wrote the bill to cut alaskans out of those decisions
pac ad republican senate candidate sullivan wrote a bill to cut alaskans out of hunting decisions
when decisions are being made about where we can hunt where we can fish alaskan voices should be taken out of the picture
and third the ad may have exaggerated the potential impact of the measure implying that the bill would have kept alaskans out of discussions regarding hunting rather than just fishing
