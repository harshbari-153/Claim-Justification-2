Says Scott Bruun "still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize Social Security."
my opponent apparently still believes in the same old direction that george bush had before which is to privatize social security
so what about schrader s claim that bruun apparently still believes in the same old direction that george bush had before which is to privatize social security bruun does seem to be suggesting an approach similar to bush s in that he would allow younger workers to begin investing a portion of their social security taxes in a series of funds monitored by the government
it s beyond dispute that if he s elected to congress bruun would vote to partially privatize social security
incumbent democrat kurt schrader has claimed that republican scott bruun advocates privatizing social security
kurt schrader says scott bruun wants to privatize social security
