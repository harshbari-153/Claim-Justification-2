"Only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian."
huckabee said only one out of five of the syrian refugees who went into europe were actually syrian
what we do know is only one out of five of the syrian refugees who went into europe were actually syrian huckabee said
overall syrian refugees account for half of all refugees arriving in europe in so far
first the four out of five migrants are not falsely claiming to be syrian as huckabee s phrasing syrian refugees suggests
the guardian explains why this distorts the refugee situation if you lump this group in with those who crossed the mediterranean to claim asylum the number of syrians will naturally seem smaller
