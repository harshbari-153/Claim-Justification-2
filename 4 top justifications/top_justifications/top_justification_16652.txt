says african americans are three to four times more likely to be arrested for drug crimes and nine times more likely to be imprisoned
african americans are three to four times more likely to be arrested for drug crimes and nine times more likely to be imprisoned
that s close to an assertion on the naacp criminal justice fact sheet that the imprisonment rate of african americans for drug charges is almost six times that of whites
she s on the mark in saying blacks are three to four times more likely to be arrested for drug offenses
people of every race use illegal drugs at similar rates yet african americans are far more likely to be imprisoned than whites she says on her campaign website
