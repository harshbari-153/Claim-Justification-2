"Residents could have received nearly $48M for Local Schools, Fire District, Sheriffâ€™s Dept. and Social Services."
could clackamas county residents have received nearly million for police fire and schools
according to the flier here s where most of that money would have gone if not for savas vote million to the north clackamas school district million to clackamas fire district million to the sheriff s office and million to clackamas county s general fund
one the amount that would have gone to the general fund was accurate and another the amount for fire services wasn t far off
the flier among other things said savas helped table a motion under which residents could have received nearly for local schools fire district sheriff s dept
why because the million claimed on the flier as destined for the north clackamas school district actually would have gone to the state school fund
