"Worldwide data has confirmed the vaccinated are developing COVID vaccine-induced Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome."
whilst you ve been distracted by the march blog post says worldwide data has confirmed the vaccinated are developing covid acquired immune deficiency syndrome
though the blog s title leads readers to expect global data to support the statement that vaccines are causing aids in its recipients no such evidence is presented
vaccines don t cause aids but a recent blog post claims otherwise
rather it lays out a case that pulls data from various sources and ends with these closing arguments we therefore propose that the injections are causing either acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or a new novel condition with similar attributes that can only be described as vaccine acquired immune deficiency syndrome vaids
as we ve previously reported the vaccine doesn t introduce hiv into the body or cause aids
