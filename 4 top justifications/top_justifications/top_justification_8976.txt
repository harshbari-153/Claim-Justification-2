that he says makes oregon unique oregon is the only state out of the states in the usa that continues to pay of the medical benefits for its employees and their families
richardson says oregon is the only state the nation that pays of the medical benefits for its employees and their families
he cited as his proof one sentence in the report oregon is one of two states that pay the full cost of health benefits for employees and their dependents the other is alaska and is the only state to do so in plans with no deductibles
and even that source was a bit misguided in its assertion about oregon being one of two to cover medical benefits completely
he said the line that oregon was one of two states to cover the full cost came from the public employees benefit board
