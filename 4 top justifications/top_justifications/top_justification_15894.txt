"You had the last two administrations deport twice as many people as we deported â€” twice as many."
biden said you had the last two administrations deport twice as many people as we deported twice as many
biden look you had the last two administrations deport twice as many people as we deported twice as many
biden is right that bush and clinton deported twice as many people if one is counting the number of people formally removed plus the number of people turned away at the southwest border in a less formal process
vice president but the numbers that i have from the department of homeland security you deported more than million people
biden no no no because you had more people deported in the w administration bush and the clinton administration
