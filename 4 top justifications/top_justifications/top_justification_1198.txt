"I balanced the budget for four straight years, paid off $405 billion in debt."
i balanced the budget for four straight years paid off billion in debt
in that video he said for four years we balanced the budget and paid off billion in debt
the budget was indeed balanced for four years but it s a stretch for him to take credit for more than two of those years
first the balanced budget
but that would be because over the full four years of his speakership the debt rose by about billion
