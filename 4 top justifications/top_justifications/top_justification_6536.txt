Says Donald Trump said of women, "And you can tell them to go f--- themselves."
apparently the f themselves portion of the ad does speak for trump either at least when it comes to referring to women
donald trump attitude toward women has been a major issue in the presidential campaign since megyn kelly grilled him about some of his negative comments at the gop s first presidential debate
and you can tell them to go f themselves
trump in a tweet about the ad complained that he was talking about women in the clip although he mistakenly said he was referring to china
in no way do we ever claim he was saying that to women
