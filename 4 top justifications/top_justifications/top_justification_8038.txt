Congress used earmarks "for more than 200 years."
harry reid says congress used earmarks for years
reid said congress has used earmarked spending for more than years
a credible case can be made that congress engaged in something like earmarking as long ago as and
still reid has a point that legislators have long directed spending and there are and older examples of things that are very much like earmarks
so the earmark has a long history
