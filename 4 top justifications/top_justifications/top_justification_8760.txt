"Your family" will pay $2,500 "after Kara Eastman eliminates your tax cut."
and finally that s how much more your family will pay after eastman eliminates your tax cut
if both parts are true that the median annual tax cut for a family of four in eastman s district was and if eastman wants to repeal the tax law then the claim would be accurate
next we looked at why the congressional leadership fund says eastman would take these tax cuts away
the claim that eastman will raise taxes on your family by is based on a generalization in a single article that could be open to interpretation
saying that because eastman was opposed to the tax cuts and jobs act of the republican tax cuts signed by president donald trump just before christmas and has spoken of repeal a vote for eastman would be a vote to eliminate your tax cuts
