Under Wisconsin law, "anyone who knows anything about a John Doe" secret criminal investigation "can't talk about it."
wisconsin law prohibits anyone who knows about a secret john doe investigation from talking about it gov scott walker says
asked whether his lawyer was in negotiations to settle a john doe criminal investigation walker said that under wisconsin law anyone who knows anything about a john doe ca talk about it
a person who knows something about a john doe by virtue of participating in the secret court proceedings if they are individually ordered by a judge not to disclose anything about the proceedings is prohibited from revealing such information
but the governor s statement is overbroad in suggesting that anyone who knows any information about a john doe can t talk about it
when the secrecy provision is invoked individuals who are ordered by a john doe judge not to disclose information about a doe investigation are prohibited from doing so
