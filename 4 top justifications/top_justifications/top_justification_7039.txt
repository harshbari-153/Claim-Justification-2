"Migrant mother and ‘crying girl’ on Time cover never separated."
a headline by the gateway pundit said migrant mother and crying girl on time cover never separated
immigrant girl on time cover was separated from mother
the girl s father as well as a border patrol agent confirmed that the girl and her mother were not separated
a time magazine cover photo of a young immigrant girl sobbing as she looked up at president donald trump became a symbol of the criticism over trump s immigration policies but the iconic image was misleading
time published a correction in a story in which the photographer was interviewed stating that the girl was not carried away by agents and the two were taken away together
