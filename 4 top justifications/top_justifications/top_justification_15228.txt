Foxconn hasn't hit job targets on its massive Wisconsin factory because "No. 1, you had a pandemic."
the benchmarks that showed foxconn struggling all occurred before the pandemic the company fell short of even minimum hiring targets in and while investing nowhere near the money initially projected by this point for what was to have been a generation
it has been clear for more than months that foxconn was no longer pursuing the project proposed evaluated negotiated and contracted for with wedc wedc secretary and ceo missy hughes said in a statement to politifact wisconsin
but through it all foxconn has pressed forward with its wisconsin plans
the pandemic no doubt has played a role in foxconn s struggles where the state expects the company to fall even farther off of its projected hiring levels
referencing the pandemic as the primary reason for foxconn s struggles is flat wrong
