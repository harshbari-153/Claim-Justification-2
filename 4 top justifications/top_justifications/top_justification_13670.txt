"I havenâ€™t really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past."
paul said i haven t really proposed phasing out aid to israel in the past
so was paul correct when he said i haven t really proposed phasing out aid to israel in the past we took a closer look
yahoo news reported that when paul was asked whether he thought the united states should phase out aid to israel he answered i haven t really proposed that in the past
while the statement his office released is correct that paul s original proposal never targeted israeli aid israeli aid would have been swept up in the nixing of all foreign aid this response doesn t support the notion that he hadn t really proposed phasing out aid to israel in the past
the elimination of all foreign aid including provisions to israel is not necessarily a new idea
