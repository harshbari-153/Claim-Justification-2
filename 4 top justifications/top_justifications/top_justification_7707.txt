Says Chicago "had the lowest murder rates in a generation" during his time as police superintendent.
mccarthy said we had the lowest murder rates in a generation pointing to his strategy as police superintendent for combating gang violence as the reason for the decline
we had the lowest murder rates in a generation mccarthy says in the ad
the rate is a reflection of how many murders a city logs per residents and since chicago has a much smaller population than it did decades ago lower numbers of actual murders don t necessarily translate into rates
rate for chicago in when murders began a noticeable series of annual plunges
his statement statistics and ignores the broader historical context of crime in chicago
