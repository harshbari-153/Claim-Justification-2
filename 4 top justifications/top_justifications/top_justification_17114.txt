Michelle Obama ordered $400 worth of lobster and caviar at a New York hotel.
the newspaper has since posted a correction the source who told us last week about michelle obama getting lobster and caviar delivered to her room at the must have been under the influence of a drug
so the flying around the internet that says michelle obama ordered of lobster and iranian caviar is just wrong and because it a based on a retracted news item we rate it pants on firethe receipt then lists things like whole steamed lobsters and iranian osetra caviar
it then shows a receipt with the caption receipt signed by michelle obama at waldorf astoria on october at p
a new claims to depict a room service receipt signed by michelle obama
