An image of a woman buried up to her neck and drinking a spoonful of water was from Iran and taken just before she was "stoned to death" under Sharia Law.
a viral image recently posted to facebook of a woman buried in the ground up to her neck sipping a spoonful of water is misleading users to believe it was taken in iran just before the woman was to be stoned to death
text just below the photo reads a woman just before being stoned to death in iran under shariah laws
at some places on this earth women s rights are limited to getting a spoonful of water before stoning
image of colombian protester is falsely described as example of iranian torture of women
the photograph is real but has nothing to do with islam sharia law or stoning as social media s false caption suggests
