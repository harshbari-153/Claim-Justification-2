FCAT tests "account for less than 1 percent of the instructional time provided during the year."
robinson said that the fcat tests account for less than percent of the instructional time provided during the year
florida education commissioner says the fcat takes up less than percent of the instructional time during the school year
there are a few interesting claims in robinson s statement but the one that caught our eye was that tiny figure the fcat accounts for less than percent of instructional time
we asked newman why is it valid to only look at the minutes spent actually taking the test and not factor in how much time is spent preparing for the test he said it s up to the school districts to determine how to teach those standards that are assessed on the fcat and those methods can vary from school to school
we asked a few florida teachers how much instructional time they spend on the fcat
