"Shocking Video Emerges of Obama Mocking God and the Bible."
one group called yes i m right shared a link to an article titled shocking video emerges of obama mocking god and the bible
however the few snippets of obama s longer speech do not accurately reflect his views on christianity overall and it is an overstatement to say that he is mocking god
old obama video misrepresents his views on christianity
here s where things get interesting the video wasn t edited together by conservative groups seeking to discredit obama s religious views
in the attached minute video obama does not denigrate christianity
