Barack Obama has "reversed" on his commitment "to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately."
today barack obama reversed that position proving once again that his words do not matter
since announcing his campaign in the central premise of barack obama candidacy was his commitment to begin withdrawing american troops from iraq immediately said brian rogers a mccain spokesman
obama shifts emphasis on iraq but not position
we find the mccain campaign statement that obama has reversed position to be falseobama replied of course i would factor in the possibilities of genocide and i factored it in when i said that i would begin a phased withdrawal
