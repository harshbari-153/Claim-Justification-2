grothman claimed biden is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same carbon emission standards we do at home
meanwhile potus is trying to send taxpayer dollars to manufacturers overseas that do not abide by the same standards we do at home

for our purposes we re left with a claim that overstates the intent and effect of biden s proposal particularly in the way a reader would likely understand it
