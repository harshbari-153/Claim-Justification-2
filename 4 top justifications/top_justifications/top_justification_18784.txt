SaysÂ Congressman Jack Kingston voted to "raise his pay seven times."
so how can perdue say that kingston voted to raise his own pay seven times when automatic pay raises were established in and kingston s only been in congress since jan
so did kingston vote seven times to give himself a raise no
perdue is off base to say kingston voted to raise his pay seven times
when there was a direct vote to decline pay increases kingston voted with the majority to do just that eight times
kingston voted with the majority eight times
