The Democrat-backed health care reform plan "will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars."
boehner says democrats health care plan would subsidize abortions
again things could change as the health reform package works its way through congress but for now we do see anything to support boehner claim that taxpayers would subsidize abortions
in an piece on july house republican leader john boehner of ohio repeated the concerns of many who oppose abortion that the health care reform plan will require americans to subsidize abortion with their tax dollars
and so began the debate over how to make the health care reform bill abortion neutral
although there are several versions of the health care bill kicking around in congress one thing has now become clear most envision a health plan option that could include abortion coverage as well as a health care exchange in which participating private insurance companies would be permitted to offer such coverage
