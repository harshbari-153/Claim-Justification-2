"Ted Nugent killed in hunting accident."
a fake news story that appeared on multiple disreputable websites on april carried a headline that read conservative icon ted nugent killed in hunting accident
reports about ted nugent dying or not on hunting trip is convoluted hoax
a series of internet posts that claimed outspoken rocker ted nugent had been killed in a hunting accident then was assassinated then was faking his own death was all fake news
the story which is fake said nugent was hunting from a tree stand before dawn somewhere in montana when he was shot in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear
it s apparent nugent was not killed nor did he perpetrate his own death hoax
