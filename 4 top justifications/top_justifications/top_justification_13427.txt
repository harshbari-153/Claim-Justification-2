"The folks in Washington" are "already forcing you to buy government health care."
beruff said washington politicians are already forcing you to buy government health care
he continued they re already forcing you to buy government health care
no you still not being forced buy government health care
the bigger problem is beruff s use of government health care
but just as before the law the majority obtain it from private sources such as their employer or from choosing plans offered in health insurance marketplaces set up by federal or state regulators
