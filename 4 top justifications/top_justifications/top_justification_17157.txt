"Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003."
last year american oil production reached its highest level since
our oil production reached its highest level in seven years
barack obama says oil production last year was highest since
oil production from federal waters in the gulf of mexico reached an high
so obama is right that american oil production is at its highest level since but we re taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline
