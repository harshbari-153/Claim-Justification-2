President Obama has "added $4 billion in debt every day."
he s added billion in debt every day
the day obama was sworn in as president the total debt was about

burtless said that most of the debt added under obama would have happened even if he followed the tax and spending policies in effect when he took office
that billion in debt a day figure sounds pretty massive
