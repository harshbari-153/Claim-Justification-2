Says Kamala Harris oversaw a police department that was "abusing peopleâ€™s rights" and that she did not "disclose to defense attorneys" when there was exculpatory evidence: "She didn't do that. She never did it. And so, what happened? Along came a federal judge and said enough, enough, and he freed 1,000 of these people."
