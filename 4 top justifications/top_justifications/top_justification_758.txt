Says the logo of a porn website appeared during a CNN broadcast.
no a porn site logo didn t appear on cnn broadcast
a clip spreading on social media shows cnn anchors wolf blitzer and john king standing in front of a screen showing some results from the presidential election when king appears to swipe away the logo for pornhub
this post was flagged as part of facebook s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed
levity feels in short supply this week so if you chuckled seeing a logo of a porn website flash onto the screen during a cnn broadcast we re sorry to tell you that it was doctored
king does swipe away a graphic in the original video it s unclear what it is but it doesn t have the pornhub logo on it or anything else that s nsfw
