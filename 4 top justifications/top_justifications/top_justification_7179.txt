Harry Reid has voted "to give illegals Social Security benefits even for the time they were here illegally."
the second charge in the ad is that reid voted to give illegals social security benefits even for the time they were here illegally
sharron angle says harry reid wants to give illegals social security benefits
that was a claim that democratic majority leader harry reid voted go give special tax breaks to illegal aliens
for one thing the vote would have given current illegals social security benefits as the ad implies
instead reid votes affected the policy for former illegal aliens who were later made legal
