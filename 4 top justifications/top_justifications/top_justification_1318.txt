Says Jim Renacci "opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops."
for this fact check we ll look at the claim that renacci opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops
renacci tried to skip out on paying over a million in taxes the narrator says but opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops
dccc says jim renacci voted against combat bonuses for troops
what is the merit of the democratic tv ad charging that renacci opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops the claim is based on renacci s vote on a motion to recommit that preceded a final vote on military pay
and when congressman renacci wants to place tax cuts for himself and his rich friends and take away veterans services for those serving in country and out of country i think it an atrocity
