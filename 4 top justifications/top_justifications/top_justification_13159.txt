Oregon concealed gun applications include "home phone numbers, home address, Social Security numbers, what kinds of guns you have in the house … whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military, what controlled substances you are taking and  were you ever accused of -- accused, mind you -- of stalking."
the oregon house recently passed a bill that would remove concealed handgun applications from the public record
for what it s worth those last two questions the one on controlled substances and the one about stalking are pretty important given that federal law according to the application prohibits folks who say yes to those questions from possessing firearms at all much less handguns of the concealed variety
kim thatcher says concealed handgun applications require great deal of personal information
what kinds of guns you have in the house not usually
kim thatcher s defense of the move from the house debate on the day they passed the bill as the law stands now the information in these applications includes things like home phone numbers home address social security numbers what kinds of guns you have in the house that what on the application whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military what controlled substances you are taking and were you ever accused of accused mind you of stalking thatcher said
