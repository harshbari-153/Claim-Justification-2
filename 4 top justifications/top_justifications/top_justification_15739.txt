"Mitt Romneyâ€™s platform ...won't protect the mortgage interest (tax) deduction for middle-class families."
our ruling cutter said mitt romney platform wo protect the mortgage interest deduction for families
stephanie cutter said mitt romney platform wo protect the mortgage interest tax deduction for families
obama deputy campaign manager stephanie cutter wrote in an email that romney wo protect the mortgage interest deduction for families if romney enacts his tax plan even though it helps more than million families
still it a stretch to conclude from that wording that romney would eliminate the deduction
the wall street journal reported in april that romney said at a fundraiser that he wants to stop allowing deductions on second homes
