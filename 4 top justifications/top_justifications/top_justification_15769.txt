cruz said that it was cnn not his campaign that first reported that carson taking a break from campaigning and his campaign forwarded that news to his supporters
cnn reported that carson was to take a break after iowa while simultaneously noting that carson would ultimately continue campaigning
during the discussion cnn graphic does say campaign carson to take a break after iowa
ted cruz falsely says campaign simply cnn report on ben carson
the cruz campaign sent messages on its app anyway saying that carson would stop his campaign
