president obama went around the world and apologized for america romney said in response to a question about israel and the middle east
mitt romney charged that president obama has gone around the world apologizing for america
mitt romney repeats claim that obama went around the world apologizing for the united states
did obama apologize back in we sent obama remarks to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies to see if they thought obama was apologizing
what s new from the debate what romney said at the debate in orlando he went around the world and apologized for america is very similar to what he said at his campaign stop in june a few months into office he traveled around the globe to apologize for america
