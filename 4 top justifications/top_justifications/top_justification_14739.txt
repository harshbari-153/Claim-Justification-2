U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin didn't want a border fence to block illegal immigration "because he is afraid that someone will get hurt trying to go around the fence."
langevin is opposed to fences where they could work because he is afraid that someone will get hurt trying to go around the fence
gardiner says langevin opposed border fence for fear someone will get hurt
so langevin does want a secure border because he afraid someone might get hurt trying to circumvent it we called gardiner at his law office and asked for the source of that assertion
but nowhere on the website does it actually say as gardiner does that langevin opposed the measure because he thought the fence might cause someone to get hurt
spokeswoman joy fox responded with an email saying that langevin is not convinced that the border fence is an answer to the problem of border security
