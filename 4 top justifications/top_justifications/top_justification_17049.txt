Says Barack "Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’ "
our ruling in a mailer the national rifle association says that obama admits he s coming for our guns telling sarah brady we are working on gun control but under the radar
on the nra list obama admits he s coming for our guns telling sarah brady we are working on gun control but under the radar
the quote then gets distorted by the nra to obama admits he s coming for our guns telling sarah brady we are working on gun control but under the radar
although the wording leaves plenty of room for interpretation it not accurate to summarize that quote by saying obama admits he s coming for our guns because the specifics of obama s comment as relayed by brady are unknown
but the nra makes a tremendous leap by concluding that the quote shows that obama admits he coming for our guns
