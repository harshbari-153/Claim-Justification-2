Since 2009, "millions of Americans have lost their health care plans."
since then millions of americans have lost their health care plans
senate candidate josh hawley wrote in an for the springfield that millions of americans have lost their healthcare plans
he noted that roughly million more people gained health care coverage during this time period
on the surface these notices can seem alarming so we reached out to experts to see if they actually meant that people who received them lost health care coverage
by removing this some americans may not purchase health insurance because they will no longer be fined for doing so
