Says Steph Curry decided to split with Nike because the company wouldnâ€™t allow him to write Bible scriptures in his shoes.
did golden state warriors basketball player steph curry part ways with nike because the company wouldn t let him put bible verses on his shoes
no nike and steph curry didn t split over bible verses
steph curry had to make a decision to either stop writing scripture in his shoe before every game while wearing nikes or wear a sneaker made by a company who would support his vision
steph curry decided that his faith was more important that sic the fortune he earned from nike so he cancelled his deal with nike and now wears under armor sneakers and they print the scripture in his shoes for him
it s true that curry writes his favorite bible verse on his shoes but there is no indication nike barred him from writing the verse or that any such conflict over curry writing bible verses inspired curry to leave the company and join under armour
