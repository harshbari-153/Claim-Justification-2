Says 89 members of Congress "hold dual citizenship with Israel."
a online rumor questions the loyalties of dozens of congress members by saying they have dual citizenship with israel
on the facebook page small people against big government said of our senators and congress hold dual citizenship citizenship sic with israel
no members of congress do have automatic dual citizenship with israel
some people may think jews have automatic dual citizenship due to a misinterpretation of the israeli law of return
before we get into specific flaws of the list it important to know that just because everyone on the list is jewish does not mean they hold dual citizenship with israel
