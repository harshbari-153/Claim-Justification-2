Says his budget "calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history."
in his address to congress president donald trump said his budget calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in american history
trump said his budget plan has one of the largest increases in defense spending in the country s history
the defense budget trump proposed for is a significant increase but it is not one of the largest increases harrison told politifact
but when we looked at past budgets we found there have been much heftier jumps in military spending
but in the past three decades there have been years when the base defense budget has gone up more than what trump has requested
