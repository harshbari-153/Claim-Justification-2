"Weâ€™re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak."
we re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the aids epidemic at its peak
cuomo in a press conference in buffalo said we re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the aids epidemic at its peak
so did the number of deaths from heroin and opioid overdoses actually match aids at its peak
think about that the aids epidemic one of the worst things that society has had to deal with and the loss of life is just about the same with this heroin epidemic
the scourge of heroin and opioid deaths still doesn t match aids at its worst
