"Sen. McCain says it was not a mistake to vote against the Bush tax cuts ... but now says the tax cuts need to be made permanent."
mccain has long cultivated a reputation as a straight talk fiscal conservative saying that tax cuts must be matched by spending cuts
he said he would have preferred a plan that included spending cuts as well as tax cuts but added that he believes the tax cuts should now be made permanent
two years later mccain opposed in additional tax cuts saying he could support cutting taxes in the face of unknown war costs
so these tax cuts need to be made permanent
but in mccain voted to extend the bush tax cuts for five years saying not to do so would be tantamount to raising taxes at a time when the economy was sputtering
