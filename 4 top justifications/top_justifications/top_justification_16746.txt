"The average Republican voter thinks there should be some revenue as part of this deal."
on the politics of this if you look at the polling it turns out that the average republican voter thinks there should be some revenue as part of this deal right so the president has agreed to not just to an agreement that way to the right of the average american voter
it actually to the right of what the average republican voter wants
in conclusion when we rated a similar statement from obama a few weeks ago the evidence seemed more mixed on whether republicans favor some form of tax increases as part of a budget deal the way that democrats and independents do
paul krugman said the average republican favors including taxes as part of overall debt deal
obama said back on july that the clear majority of republican voters think that any deficit reduction package should have a balanced approach and should include some revenues
