Says she couldn't take stimulus money because it required "universal building codes."
the wording in the stimulus bill related to the weatherization money may have left room for palin concerns but the letter from the department of energy made clear that universal building codes were not going to be forced upon state and local governments as a condition for accepting the federal money
sarah palin claims weatherization money in stimulus required universal building codes
she claimed then as she does again in her book that the money had not just string but ropes attached to it that would require the state to adopt universal building codes
chalk of the department of energy who stated that the stimulus provision recognizes that not every state has statewide building codes and that the governor does not have the authority to force local governments to implement building codes
palin opposition to the funding may give her license to claim she opposed the stimulus plan even though it was only a small portion of alaska funding but her reasoning does jibe with the assurances from the department of energy
