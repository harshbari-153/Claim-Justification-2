Says Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that "if he has a nuclear weapon he will use it to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. He will use it against the United States of America."
she paraphrased ahmadinejad as saying he has said that if he has a nuclear weapon he will use it to wipe israel off the face of the earth
ahmadinejad has said some tough things about the united states and israel but we find no evidence that he has said he would use a nuclear weapon against either country
he has said that if he has a nuclear weapon he will use it to wipe israel off the face of the earth
however where bachmann misstepped was by accusing ahmadinejad of saying he planned to use a nuclear weapon against israel or the united states
he will use it against the united states of america
