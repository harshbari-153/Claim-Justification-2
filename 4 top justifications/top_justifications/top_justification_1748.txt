UPS left 15,000 employeesâ€™ spouses "without health insurance" and told them to, "go on an exchange with no employer subsidy."
that is ups employees who had insurance for their husbands and wives and suddenly those husbands and wives are left without health insurance and being told go on an exchange with no employer subsidy
cruz said that by dropping spousal health insurance for employees ups left employees spouses without health insurance and told them to go on an exchange with no employer subsidy
but cruz is wrong that the ups spouses would be without health insurance and would have to go on an exchange with no employer subsidy
if a ups employee is on the company s plan and their spouse is employed at a different company that offers health insurance the spouse will no longer be eligible for the ups plan and must purchase insurance from their own employer
ted cruz says policy change by ups left employees spouses without health insurance
