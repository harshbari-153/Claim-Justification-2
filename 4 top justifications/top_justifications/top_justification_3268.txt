"If there were not derivatives, there would be no bank loans at all today."
jeff greene said that if there were not derivatives there would be no bank loans at all today
if there were not derivatives there would be no bank loans at all today because people want to get loans but banks do want to keep loans on their books said greene
a claim that banks wo make sound loans without derivatives is ridiculous wrote lynn a
banks were making mortgage loans before the derivatives that greene was talking about even existed and they would continue to make them even if derivatives disappeared tomorrow albeit perhaps in decreased quantities
in this context banks can use derivatives as a form of insurance policy if the borrower defaults on his home loan for example the bank wo crumble because the derivative will pay out instead
