Says John Boehner changed his position on extending Bush tax cuts.
in a statement issued later that afternoon white house press secretary robert gibbs said we welcome john boehner change in position and support for the middle class tax cuts but time will tell if his actions will be anything but continued support for the failed policies that got us into this mess
in his answers to those first three questions boehner made clear that he favored extending the tax cuts for all brackets
is robert gibbs right to call john boehner stance on tax extensions a change in position
but in the same interview and elsewhere boehner has repeatedly said he supports extending the tax cuts for all americans
it very clear that boehner still supports extending the tax cuts for people of all incomes
