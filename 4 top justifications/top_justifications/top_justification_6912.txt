"Sean Duffy backed plan to privatize Social Security."
when we should be fighting to protect social security sean duffy backed a plan to privatize it the ad states later referring to the stock market and adding remember the crash families could have lost of their retirement benefits
but duffy is on the record repeatedly as opposing privatizing social security and says he is not supportive of ryan s entire roadmap plan
democratic congressional campaign committee says sean duffy wants to privatize social security
so the dccc ad uses a duffy statement cut and spliced by the state democrats for maximum effect to brand duffy as an advocate for privatizing social security
on his campaign website duffy states i have not and will not endorse privatizing social security because i don t believe it is the solution to making social security solvent
