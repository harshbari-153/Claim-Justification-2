"Our economy is not growing."
our economy is not growing
our will focus on scott s statement that the economy is not growing
scott said our economy is not growing
that s perhaps not the level of growth scott wants but it s misleading to say that the economy isn t growing
so for the past few years the economy has been growing maybe just not by as much as scott would like
