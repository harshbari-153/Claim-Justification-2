Says an array of statistics show that conditions in some parts of Baltimore rival that of "the West Bank in Palestine," "North Korea," and "distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa."
sanders presented a series of comparisons showing that conditions in some parts of baltimore rivaled that of the west bank in palestine north korea and distressed cities in nigeria india china and south africa
contrary to what sanders said the work by the johns hopkins researchers don t consider economic outlooks nor do they show baltimore conditions being worse than south africa s
in baltimore neighborhoods had a higher rate than the west bank
here s a map from the university of maryland s capital news service that compares the life expectancies of baltimore neighborhoods in to other places in the world
the comparisons fairly make the point that there are some parts of this rich country where conditions resemble those in much poorer countries said alan berube an expert on urban poverty at the brookings institution
