Democrats "want to tax your retirement funds to pay for their new trillion dollar power grab."
the common sense leadership fund said that democrats want to tax your retirement funds to pay for their new trillion dollar power grab
but now washington liberals want to tax your retirement funds to pay for their new trillion dollar power grab
at the heart of the ad is the claim that washington liberals read democrats want to tax your retirement funds
in fact the democratic plan it alludes to targets a thin sliver of very wealthy individuals about taxpayers those with retirement accounts worth over million
contrary to the ad s point that liberals want to steal from people s retirement other parts of the bill subsidize retirement savings by tens of millions of average income households
