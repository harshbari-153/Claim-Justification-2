rnc is right that no democratic speaker mentioned isis on convention first night
mentions of the global terrorist threat posed by isis
based on our searches of text congressional quarterly transcripts and other video archiving services we couldn t find any speaker who mentioned isis islamic terror terrorist or terrorism during the first day of the convention
night one of the democratic national convention in philadelphia had barely ended when the republican national committee sent a blast email to reporters attacking the democrats for ignoring the threat of terrorism when speaking at the podium
