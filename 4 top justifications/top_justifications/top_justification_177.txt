Says Gov. John  Kasich incorrectly claimed Ohio’s economy was 38th in the nation when he took office. "We were sixth in the nation in terms of economic job growth."
we asked strickland where he got his statistic that ohio was sixth in economic job growth when kasich took office
that backs up kasich s contention that ohio was in the nation in job creation during the four years before he took office
ted strickland claims john kasich undersold the condition ohio economy was in when he took office
during his speech kasich said that ohio was in the nation in job creation when he took office
and the statistic strickland cites to support his claim that ohio actually ranked sixth in economic job growth is misportrayed
