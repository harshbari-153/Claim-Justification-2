Welcome to Wisconsin road signs have "always been made in Wisconsin," but Scott Walker "is outsourcing them" to an out-of-state company and "paying more money for them."
criticizing walker s record on job creation tate said welcome to wisconsin road signs have always been made in wisconsin but walker is outsourcing them to an company and paying more money for them
scott walker outsourced the making of welcome to wisconsin road signs and is paying more for them democratic party leader mike tate says
not only was tate wrong in saying walker was outsourcing the construction of the brown wisconsin welcomes you signs he was wrong in suggesting that the outsourcing which actually refers to the maintenance of the blue roadway signs that promote businesses is being done at a higher cost to taxpayers
scott walker augmented the familiar signs at the state s borders that say wisconsin welcomes you
but now scott walker doa department of administration is outsourcing them i think to a company in illinois of all places and they paying more money for them
