Says "Rep. Jim Weidner proposed a bill taking away health care for 80,000 of Oregon's children."
jim weidnerproposed a bill taking away health care for of oregon children
liberal website says jim weidner tried to take health care away from oregon children
so it seems weidner does want to eliminate a tax that is being used to provide health care to children
so where does that leave us well while we re feeling pretty confident that weidner isn t care for kids he did as the website alleges propose a bill that would have eliminated the funding for health care for children
before we settled on a ruling we wanted to check one other thing even if weidner s bill had gone through are there really children who would lose health insurance we called oregon healthy kids to find out
