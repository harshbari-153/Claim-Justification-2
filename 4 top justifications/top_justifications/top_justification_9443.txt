"When (Barack Obama) took office, 2.3 million people were out of work. Five-plus years later, we have 5 million-plus out of work."
million people were out of work
million people were out of work
years later we have out of work
years later we have out of work
not only are both of the specific job figures in the meme way but the trend line is even less accurate the number of unemployed americans has declined by million or by since obama took office
