Says Daniel Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands.
maybe webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands
the grayson ad clearly suggests that webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands and the repeated refrain of submit to me is an effort to scare off potential female voters
the actual point of webster speech was that husbands should love their wives
and as opposed to wives submit yourself to your own husband
webster point was that they should pray for their wives to do something rather they should pray for what they could control in their own life
