"Rauner made you pay for abortions in all nine months of pregnancy."
ives said rauner made you pay for abortions in all nine months of pregnancy
rauner made you pay for abortions in all nine months of pregnancy ives says in the ad
so we wondered how can it be possible that rauner expanded abortion access in all nine months of pregnancy by signing the bill
the law rauner signed expands abortion access by providing coverage to any medicaid recipient and state worker who opts for the procedure before viability
instead she took it further suggesting his action opened up a new requirement for the state to pay for all abortions occurring in pregnancies closer to term as well
