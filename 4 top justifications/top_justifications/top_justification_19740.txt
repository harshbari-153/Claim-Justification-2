"Unlike you and me, Congress gets to keep up to $11,000 a year in taxpayer subsidies" under Obamacare.
but unlike you and me congress gets to keep up to a year in taxpayer subsidies all thanks to a special deal worked out with president obama
again handel claimed in a radio ad that members of congress get to keep up to a year in taxpayer subsidies to offset health care coverage costs after an arrangement made by the obama administration
so do members of congress and their staffs get to keep up to a year in taxpayer subsidies
that is a subsidy of about percent of the health insurance costs for members of congress and their staffs according to a sept
members of congress and their staffs however aren t the only ones getting subsidies
