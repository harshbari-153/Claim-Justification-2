Sherrod Brown "sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries."
ohio treasurer josh mandel says sherrod brown has sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries
the ad claims brown sent billions of dollars to foreign countries
that a ridiculous stretch from what the ad implies which is that brown tried to hide that he irresponsibly sent billions or our tax dollars to foreign countries
among several claims in mandel tv ad change which accuses brown of trying to hide his record is one that says brown sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries
but we can assess if brown is hiding as the ad states that he has sent billions of tax dollars overseas
