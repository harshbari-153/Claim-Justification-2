During the Eisenhower Administration, "not a single soldier â€¦ died in combat."
we thought we d look into whether goodwin was correct that not a single soldier died in combat during the eisenhower presidency
eisenhower having won world war ii could then take enormous pride in the fact that not a single soldier had died in combat during his time
still she made a pretty mistake hundreds of combat deaths is a number vastly greater than saying that not a single soldier had died in combat under eisenhower
doris kearns goodwin says no combat deaths under eisenhower
multiplying this percentage by the number of casualties produces combat deaths during eisenhower s six months in charge
