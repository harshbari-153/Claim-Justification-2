"In year No. 1, 14 million Americans lose coverage," according to the CBO.
million americans lose coverage
million americans lose coverage murphy said in a march press conference
we decided to murphy claim about the bill formally called the american health care act that million americans would lose coverage
this is particularly true of the people who lose coverage during the first year many of them are people dropping coverage because there is no longer a penalty
suffice it to say that while those people would no longer have coverage they did technically lose it as murphy said so much as voluntarily forgo coverage
