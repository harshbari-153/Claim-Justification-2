The climate-change agreement between the United States and China "requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years."
mcconnell said the agreement between the united states and china requires the chinese to do nothing at all for years
i was particularly distressed by the deal he s reached with the chinese on his current trip which as i read the agreement it requires the chinese to do nothing at all for years while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states across the country
several readers asked us to check whether mcconnell is right that the bilateral agreement requires the chinese to do nothing at all for years
but as questionable as it is to suggest that china could do nothing until dec
in that case the agreement itself does obligate china to take action before
