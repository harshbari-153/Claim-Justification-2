"As many as a quarter of our students arenâ€™t even finishing high school."
and yet as many as a quarter of our students aren t even finishing high school
in fact obama in his state of the union address did essentially that prefacing the statistic by saying that as many as a quarter of our students aren t even finishing high school
we wondered whether it was really true that one of every four american high school students drops out before graduating
since parents paying tuition are likely to be especially motivated to see their children finish school the true national dropout rate reported probably overstates the actual percentage of american children failing to graduate from high school
students who leave for other reasons can be excluded but this is not always done and not doing it tends to inflate the apparent number of dropouts
