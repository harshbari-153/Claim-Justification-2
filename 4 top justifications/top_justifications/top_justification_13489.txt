"A New York man has allegedly infected 240 people with the HIV virus by sleeping with men and women."
a blog post widely shared on social media claims a new york man has allegedly infected people with the hiv virus by sleeping with men and women
is the post correct that a man has infected as many as people with hiv
a website alleges a man has set out to infect as many people with hiv as possible and has infected up to people already
the post also claims the new york city department of health called this case the first time a hiv infected individual has spread hiv to so many victims
story about man spreading hiv to more than people is fake
