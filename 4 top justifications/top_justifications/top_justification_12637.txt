"Trump is addressing to the nation today."
an address to the nation is associated with the president s office and president joe biden is there not trump
one june facebook post went so far to say that he was addressing the nation that day even though the attached video didn t mention it at all
trump didn t give an address to the nation on june
he published several endorsements on his website that day and on june he spoke at a political rally in illinois
and even so speaking at a rally or posting online is different from addressing the nation
