"NATO hasn't provided enough troops (in Afghanistan) because they are still angry about us going into Iraq."
right now we do have enough troops and nato has provided enough troops because they are still angry about us going into iraq
war in iraq has made some nato countries less willing to commit troops to afghanistan
that creates a situation where the united states is finding it more difficult to garner support for more nato troops
both our troops and nato troops
many nato countries also are uncomfortable with involvement in a war thousands of miles away
