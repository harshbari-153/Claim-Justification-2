"Early voting remains at 96 hours."
in closing browning wrote today the following remains true early voting remains at hours with greater flexibility for counties
the new statute says early voting must be available for six hours each of the eight days and no more than hours per day at each polling site
to combat voter fraud reduce the burden on poll workers and provide needed flexibility to local election supervisors the number of days polls remain open has been reduced from possible days to eight days even as the total number of hours available for early voting will remain the same browning wrote in a column titled florida early voting remains at hours
so a requirement of hours of early voting has been replaced by an option of hours
the new version requires that early voting begin days before and end three days prior to an election or days overall
