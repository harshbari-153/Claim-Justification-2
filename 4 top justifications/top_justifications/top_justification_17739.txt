"If Trump gets his way, Social Security benefits will run out in just three years from now."
if trump gets his way social security benefits will run out in just three years from now
the key claim is if trump gets his way social security benefits will run out in just three years
the biden ad said if trump gets his way social security benefits will run out in just three years from now
this is contradictory but it doesn t mean he wants social security to run out of money in three years
trump s way as of now is for congress to fill in the gap so that social security remains funded
