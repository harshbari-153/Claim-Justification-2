indiana actually has a higher gas tax than illinois does even with the increase in taxes mendoza said in response
mendoza said indiana has a higher gas tax than illinois does even after a recent hike
illinois residents are also simply paying more for gasoline than people in indiana
we used to only pay cents a gallon for taxes here in illinois on the gas tax whereas indiana has been paying cents a gallon for their gas tax
by that measure gasoline is clearly taxed at higher levels in illinois
