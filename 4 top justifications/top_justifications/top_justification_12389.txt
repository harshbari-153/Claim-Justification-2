"Women account for 92.3 percent of the jobs lost under Obama."
percent of jobs lost under obama
percent figure as a measure of obama s record on women was dubious at best
first read a politics blog by nbc news had this to say does anyone believe with a straight face that nine in job losses over the past three years have been women workers and the new york times disputed the emphasis on the job losses occurring under obama
so have obama policies been especially bad for women said stevenson i don t think you could point to a single piece of evidence that the pattern of job loss men first then women is due to the president s policies
bush said much of the decline for women was in the public sector
