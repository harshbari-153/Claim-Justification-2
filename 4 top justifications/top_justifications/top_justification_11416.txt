Obama voted "to cut off funding for our American troops on the battlefield."
barack obama had voted to cut off funding for men and women in uniform
so was that a vote to cut off funding for our american troops on the battlefield
if by voting against funding for a strategy he opposed obama voted to cut off funding for the troops then so did almost every republican in the senate and lieberman himself when they voted against a appropriations bill on april that would have funded operations in iraq and afghanistan but also required bush to begin withdrawing troops from iraq
that obama tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
clearly obama wanted to provide funding for the troops just not the president military strategy
