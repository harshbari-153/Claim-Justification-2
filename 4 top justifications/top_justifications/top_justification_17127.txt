Says he "will put a moratorium on tax hikes to keep families in their homes."
in the ad a narrator promises bill will put a moratorium on tax hikes to keep families in their homes as the words property tax freeze appear on the screen
bill daley s tv ad promises he would as mayor put a moratorium on tax hikes to keep families in their homes
that isn t to say it would be politically or fiscally prudent to freeze the schools portion of the property tax
a spokesman for his campaign told us his freeze would apply only to taxes that directly fund city government
so holding the line on the city s levy as daley proposes in his ad might slow the growth of tax bills for property owners in the city but it wouldn t contain them
