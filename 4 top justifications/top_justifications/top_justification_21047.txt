Blood "starts to clot in a minute or two" after a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine injection.
in the interview a doctor says he added the pfizer vaccine to human blood and that using a microscope within a minute or two you see the blood starts to clot
an instagram post that uses excerpts from an interview on infowars a conspiracy oriented website run by alex jones claims that pfizer s vaccine causes blood clotting in a minute or two
no evidence that pfizer vaccine causes blood clots
but there is no indication that the pfizer vaccine triggers any action that results in blood clots
i am not aware of any causally related clotting problem with either the pfizer or the moderna vaccines which are known as mrna vaccines said dr
