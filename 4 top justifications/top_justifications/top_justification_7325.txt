Ashley Hinson’s and Mariannette Miller-Meeks’ no votes on the infrastructure bill are "denying rural Iowa broadband internet."
ashley hinson and mariannette both of iowa denied rural iowans broadband by voting no on the bill
dave loebsack wrote on his existing twitter account that hinson and denied rural iowans broadband by voting no on the infrastructure bill
denying rural iowans broadband alone shows how terribly partisan these two are
randy feenstra on the infrastructure mean hinson and wanted to deny iowans broadband as the comment implies the answer requires context and explanation
with more than just broadband in the infrastructure package and given and hinson s previous records in the iowa legislature supporting rural broadband funding we rate this statement to be half true
