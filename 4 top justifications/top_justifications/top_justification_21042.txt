Say "this biennium, liquor sales account for nearly $1 billion in the state budget."
this biennium liquor sales account for nearly billion in the state budget
do liquor sales account for billion of the state budget
it s true that the representatives had a basis for the billion figure but to say that liquor sales account for that much of the state budget is inaccurate and the representatives realized that when we checked in
so for the biennium the state general fund received just under million in liquor sales revenues
the oregon liquor control commission is in charge of liquor sales in the state and keeps a close eye on the distribution of revenues
