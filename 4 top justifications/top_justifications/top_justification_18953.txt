If you don't count illegal aliens, people who qualify for other insurance, and people who make more than $75,000 a year, "it leaves about 15 million people" who are uninsured.
by the way of that million people when you deduct the ones who could have insurance through their employers but do you deduct the million that basically qualify for chip or medicaid but do realize it and are not enrolled you deduct those who are over a year in income but just wo purchase their own health insurance and then million people who are illegal aliens my gosh when you put that all together it leaves about million people
million uninsured people live in households with income more than a year
and it says million people could get insurance through their employers but choose not to
that year the census found that million were uninsured and that
estimates from reputable sources indicate that roughly million of those are illegal immigrants
