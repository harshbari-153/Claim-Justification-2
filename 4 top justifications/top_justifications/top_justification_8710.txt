Says Donald Trump signed the Insurrection Act and "still is president."
no evidence that trump invoked federal insurrection act and he s not still president
during trump s final days as president false claims emerged on facebook that he had invoked the insurrection act and would be inaugurated again as president
i am assured that he still is president
a post hotly circulated on facebook claims the country is in the control of donald trump and the military because trump less than a week before his successor s inauguration invoked something known as the insurrection act
there s no evidence trump invoked the insurrection act
