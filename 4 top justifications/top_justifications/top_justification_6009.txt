"When I was mayor of New York City, I encouraged adoptions. Adoptions went up 65-70 percent. Abortions went down 16 percent."
during the may republican debate he said this when i was mayor of new york city i encouraged adoptions
adoptions went up percent abortions went down percent
this works out to a whopping percent increase in adoptions
the first two years after acs came on line there was a spike in adoptions that giuliani campaign said was because of a backlog of foster kids waiting to connect with families
the campaign did offer any research showing that rising adoption rates cause lower abortion rates and we could find any either
