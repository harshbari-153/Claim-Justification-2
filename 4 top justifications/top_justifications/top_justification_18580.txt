our ruling bush said texas will be majority hispanic in six years
george bush says texas will be majority hispanic in six years
we ll be majority hispanic in six years
that struck us as too soon though in july we rated as true a claim that within five to eight to ten years there would be more latinos in texas than there are anglos
at the time the san texas state data center said it is anticipated that the number of hispanics will exceed the number of anglos in the state at some point in the coming decade
