Says 19,000 text messages exchanged between former FBI officials that were "purposely and illegally deleted ... would have explained (the special counsel investigation) hoax."
trump said text messages exchanged between former fbi officials that were purposely and illegally deleted
trump also said the text messages between former agent peter strzok and bureau lawyer lisa page would have exposed special counsel robert mueller s probe as a hoax had they not been purposely and illegally deleted
no evidence fbi officials texts deliberately erased as donald trump said
the watchdog s findings suggest the most likely reason the texts weren t captured had to do with technical flaws in the fbi s process not deliberate wrongdoing
biggest outrage yet in the long winding and highly conflicted mueller witch hunt is the fact that demanded text messages between peter strzok and his fbi lover lisa page were purposely illegally deleted
