Californiaâ€™s rent control measure Proposition 10 would have "No effect on homeowners"
in a recent tv ad the yes on campaign claimed california s rent control measure would have no effect on homeowners
will california s rent control measure prop really have no effect on homeowners
much of the debate over california s rent control measure proposition has centered on how it will affect apartment dwellers and landlords
a spokesman for the no on campaign added that based on the campaign s interpretation of existing laws rent control would automatically be imposed on home rentals in several cities should prop pass
the california voters who view this ad understand the message people who own their own homes are not going to be affected by rent control measures
