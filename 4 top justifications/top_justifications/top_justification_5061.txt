The Democratic health care plan is a "government takeover of our health programs."
many republicans have said the democratic health care plan is a government takeover of the nation health system
bill young claims house plan was takeover of health care
i voted against the government takeover of our health programs and i going to do it again
the biggest new element in the democratic plan is a health care exchange that is supposed to provide coverage for americans who have trouble getting it now people who are or work for small companies
and once again we are faced with rhetoric about the health care plan
