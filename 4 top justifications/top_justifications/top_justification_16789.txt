Dan Seals has been running for office "since before there were, like, iPods."
instead we looking at the burning question of whether the spokesmammal was correct when he said that dan seals was running for office before there were like ipods
does it look bulky so the ipod clearly existed well before seals began to run for office
even assuming that seals started campaigning actively a year or more before the election that would only peg the beginning of his career as a candidate to
i think he was running since before there were like ipods
so versions of the ipod were on sale for three to four years before seals began running for office
