the who told us that a child s presence at school would only count as consent if a parent has received advance notice of a planned immunization and been given ample opportunity to opt out
according to the who parents grant implied consent when they send their children to a vaccination session after being notified by health authorities that vaccinations will occur at that particular time and place
for example the who said in an email the presence of the child at school on the vaccination date may be taken as implied consent if the parents have been informed that the vaccination would take place and given the opportunity to opt out or take appropriate steps to express their desire to do so
