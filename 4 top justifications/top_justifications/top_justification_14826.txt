"Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have changed their positions (on the Iraq war withdrawal) to follow Chris Dodd."
now barack obama and hillary clinton have changed their positions to follow chris dodd
here the full quote chris dodd has been challenging the other candidates to support the amendment to end our involvement in iraq civil war
and it likely that they felt some pressure from liberal democrats including dodd who strongly favor withdrawal
dodd is correct that his fellow candidates backed an amendment he
but dodd exaggerates his role
