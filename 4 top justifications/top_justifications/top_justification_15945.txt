"We've caught Iran cheating on the interim (nuclear) deal."
we decided to check whether iran was caught cheating on the interim agreement
we basically caught we caught iran cheating on the interim deal and rather than saying look we done you proven that you not an effective partner that we ca trust you they say we give you more time because we going to get to a deal
there is a big difference between the iranians have been caught cheating and a dispute about the one centrifuge
hayes said we caught iran cheating
what we discovered is that while iran isn t squeaky clean no point is definitively in violation of the interim agreement
