"Pads and tampons (are) still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not."
tell me why are pads and tampons still taxed when viagra and rogaine are not
judd said pads and tampons are still taxed when viagra and rogaine are not
are pads and tampons taxed but viagra and rogaine not
most states do tax tampons and pads but not viagra
but it s important to note that these taxes apply to broad categories and are not specific to tampons or viagra
