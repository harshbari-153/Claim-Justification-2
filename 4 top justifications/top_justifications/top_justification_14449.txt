Palin "stopped the Bridge to Nowhere."
so no palin was the only one who stopped the bridge
the bridge would cost palin said then and alaska was short
i told the congress but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere palin said at the republican national convention
palin flies high as a reformer says the headline from the anchorage daily news that scrolls onto the screen as the announcer says she stopped the bridge to nowhere
she stopped the bridge to nowhere the ad says as the screen shows a photo of a palin superimposed on an aerial picture of blue water and islands
