Says Kellyanne Conway said liberal women hate her because of her "striking beauty and intellect."
the false assertion that white house adviser kellyanne conway told an anonymous reporter that liberal women hate her for being smart and beautiful showed up on a website that made it especially confusing to identify it as fake news
com said conway told a media member at a washington luncheon that females dislike conway because of her striking beauty and intellect
kellyanne conway did not say liberal women hate her for being intelligent attractive
the article did say pundits attacked conway for the comment
the post also said conway drew criticism on social media but good luck finding anything on this specific fake comment that doesn t track back to londonwebnews
