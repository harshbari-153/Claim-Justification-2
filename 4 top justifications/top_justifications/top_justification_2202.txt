"Iowa's Republican caucus stopped mattering years ago. It in no way determines the party nominee."
noah said that the republican iowa caucuses stopped mattering years ago and in no way determines the party nominee
we thought we d look into noah s assertion that iowa s gop caucus no longer matters and that it in no way determines the party nominee
i do understand especially because iowa republican caucus stopped mattering years ago
the iowa caucuses particularly on the gop side matter less in than they did a decade or two ago
the race was so close that the iowa gop initially called the caucuses for romney
