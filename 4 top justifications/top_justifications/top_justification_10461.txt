Says Donald Trump "will not be profiting" from the G-7 summit meeting to be held at Trumpâ€™s Doral resort.
mulvaney said trump will not be profiting from the summit meeting to be held at trump s doral resort
the white house and trump s campaign did not respond to our requests for information to back up mulvaney s claim that trump wouldn t be profiting from the summit
mulvaney wrong that donald trump wo profit from choosing trump resort to host
at the very least trump can expect to profit from future business that will be generated at doral as a result of hosting an exclusive summit that will get worldwide media coverage
i think the president has pretty much made it very clear since he s got here that he doesn t profit from being here he has no interest in profit from being here that s one of the reasons that he s not taken a salary since he s been here he s given that salary to charity will not be profiting here
