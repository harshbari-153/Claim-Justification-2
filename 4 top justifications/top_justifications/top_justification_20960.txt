Says if you try to hide marijuana in a hemp field, "it becomes worthless. The THC goes away."
yarborough said that if you try to hide a marijuana growing operation in a hemp field it becomes worthless
of hemp and marijuana will cause marijuana buds to lose much of their thc but the thc won t go away entirely
all came to the same conclusion anyone who tries to hide marijuana inside a hemp field isn t a very smart criminal
it may look like marijuana but hemp can not get you high
and while marijuana likely wouldn t see its thc content drop all the way to hemp s virtually nonexistant levels like yarborough said beckerman said it would be drastically reduced
