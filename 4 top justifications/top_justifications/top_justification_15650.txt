"Both Cruz andÂ Rubio are missing the vast majority of their votes."
both cruz and rubio are missing the vast majority of their votes
paul said rubio and cruz are missing the vast majority of their votes in the senate
we found that paul far overstated when he said cruz and rubio missed the vast majority of their votes
and over the past three months rubio has missed a majority of his votes skipping out on nearly percent as he campaigns for president
between the months of october and december specifically rubio did miss a majority of his votes skipping out of total votes
