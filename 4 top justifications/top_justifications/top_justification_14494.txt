Mitch McConnell opposed "legislation to create and protect Kentucky jobs . . . help for the unemployed. . .Â  health care for Kentucky's children," and "fair pay for women."
the ad says that mcconnell opposed legislation to create and protect kentucky jobs help for the unemployed health care for kentucky children and fair pay for women
mcconnell said no to legislation to create and protect kentucky jobs and to help for the unemployed
but we found evidence that mcconnell opposed the bill because of its significant expense not because he opposed creating jobs or helping the unemployed
so again this seems to be a case where mcconnell disagreed with the legislative specifics not the underlying value of health care for children
mcconnell voted against the bill but not because he opposes fair pay
