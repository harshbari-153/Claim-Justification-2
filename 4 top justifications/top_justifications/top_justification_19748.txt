Says Paul Soglin took Madison backward -- "businesses have left and murders have gone up."
walker says soglin took madison backward businesses have left and murders have gone up
so let s check the attack walker is claiming that in madison businesses have left and murders have gone up and that soglin is at least partly to blame
paulsoglin is the latest extreme liberal who wants to take our state backward just like he did in madison where businesses have left and murders have gone up
there are of course examples of businesses having left madison but the total number of businesses appears to be higher now than when soglin took office
so the figures indicate the number of businesses has gone up and down during soglin s tenure but there are more now than when he took office
