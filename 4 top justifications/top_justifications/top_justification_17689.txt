Before the presidential campaign, "I didn't know Steve (Bannon)."
trump said that before the presidential campaign i didn t know steve referring to steve bannon
trump didn t know steve
did he or didn t he trump contradicts himself on whether he knew steve bannon
so in trump s own words he either didn t know steve or he has known steve for many years
added mckay coppins of the atlantic just for the record trump is pretty blatantly not telling the truth when he says he did know bannon until late in the campaign
