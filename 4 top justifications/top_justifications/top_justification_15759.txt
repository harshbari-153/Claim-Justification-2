Says Donald Trump "is going to go out and carpet bomb" the Middle East.
biden said that donald trump is going to go out and carpet bomb
trump has made it clear that he not going to be reluctant to bomb isis but the candidate has not as far as we could find called for a practice that includes bombing civilians which is what carpet bombing can entail
trump is also correct that cruz was the candidate who called for carpet bombing
instead the republican has repeatedly said he would bomb the hell out of isis with no reference to carpet bombing or any comparable tactic
trump with isis you kill them at the head
