My support from young voters -- those 18 to 24 -- Â in November 2014 was "largely unheard of for a Republican."
that largely unheard of for a republican
walker said his performance in indicates that he appeals to young voters in a way that s largely unheard of for a republican
was walker s performance among young voters in unusually strong for a republican
but what about walker s broader point that his appeal to young voters in was unusually strong for a republican candidate
so generally speaking walker s performance was better than that of a typical republican among young voters
