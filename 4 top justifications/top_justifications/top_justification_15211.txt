In Virginia "there has been a billion dollars in surplus over the last three years. The legislature has spent less than 1 percent of that on roads."
there s been over billion in surplus over the last three years the legislature has spent less than percent of that on roads norquist said on the john fredericks show
norquist says virginia has spent less than percent of budget surpluses on roads
so if you can t prioritize unexpected revenue because the economy grew faster than you were planning when can you begin to prioritize roads we wondered whether virginia really has spent less than percent of its surplus on roads during the last three years
democrats and some senate republicans also have noted that the state does not always end its fiscal year in surplus and argued that virginia needs a dependable source of new revenues to solve its transportation problems
for example the state s constitution requires that a portion of the surplus be deposited in the rainy day fund used to cushion virginia through lean budget cycles
