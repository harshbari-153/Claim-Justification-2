house gop rules package bars cbo from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an aca repeal ellison tweeted on jan
ellison tweeted that the house gop rules package bars cbo from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an aca repeal
but while ellison tweeted that the package bars cbo from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an aca repeal it actually doesn t say cbo can t analyze the law s costs
rather the provision in the rules package lifts the requirement that cbo track the cost of repeal or reform over the unusually long period mandated by the rules provision that is years after the first year cbo measures
according to the rule any bills flagged as adding to the deficit by this required cbo analysis would be considered out of order effectively sidelining them
