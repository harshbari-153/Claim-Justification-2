Chinese workers made "90,000 banners" for Trumpâ€™s 2020 re-election campaign and the president chose to hire "Chinese workers instead of American workers"
a facebook post shows a picture of a chinese factory worker making one of the trump banners and accuses the america first president of hiring chinese workers over american workers
so when an image claiming to show chinese factory workers making one of apparently thousands of trump campaign banners hits the interne people took notice
yes trump banners are being made in china but it does appear his campaign is paying
keep america great text near the bottom of the photo says here s a chinese factory worker making one of the banners for trump s campaign
but is it true that some of his campaign banners are being made in china
