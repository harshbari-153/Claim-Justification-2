"750 days since Bill Nelson & the Democrats in the Senate passed a budget. How can this be justified?"
remember though what lemieux said was days since the senate passed a budget not since we had a budget
in a tweet on may lemieux wrote days since bill nelson the democrats in the senate passed a budget
our ruling the number of days since a budget passed the senate is correct
has it really been years since the senate approved a budget we decided to find out
what has been nelson role in the budget haggling since then nelson did his part in for a budget resolution as a member of the senate budget committee
