About 1 in 10 public school teachers in Wisconsin would have been laid off without federal stimulus funds.
wisconsin gov jim doyle says percent of public school teachers would have lost their jobs without federal stimulus aid
to illustrate his point about the benefit of stimulus funding doyle argues that in public school teachers out of some in the state would be out of work without the stimulus money
even if you accept doyle s premise that nearly percent of teachers were funded by stimulus it s far from certain they would have been laid off without it
for instance koczela said some special education teachers likely faced layoff without those allocations
in making the claim doyle points to a federal report that says there were education jobs funded by federal stimulus cash
