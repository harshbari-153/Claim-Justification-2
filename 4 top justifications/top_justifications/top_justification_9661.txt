"The House Democrats snuck a provision into their $3 trillion bailout bill today that would keep the house in recess until July 21."
the house democrats snuck a provision into their trillion bailout bill today that would keep the house in recess until july the may post said
no house democrats did not sneak long recess into heroes act
correction the recess language was not in the stimulus bill itself but was included in measure hr the group posted may on facebook the measure states the house stay in recess until july not that it absolutely
so nothing snuck into a bill and nothing anywhere that would keep the house in recess until july
that measure said the house could adjourn on any legislative day during the period from may through july
