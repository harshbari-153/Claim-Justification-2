"There is no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group."
our ruling deshotel said there is no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other group
deshotel said in his response there is no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other group
joe deshotel says there is no evidence showing poor people use drugs more frequently than members of other groups
still the idea that there is no evidence that people use drugs more frequently does not hold up
none deshotel a house member since told us by phone that he should have said there is little evidence that people abuse drugs more than others
