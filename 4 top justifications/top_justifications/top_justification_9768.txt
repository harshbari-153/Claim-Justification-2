Says rejecting federal aid to expand Medicaid in Texas will "send $9 billion in federal taxes paid by Texans to other states to insure their working poor."
lon burnam says rejecting expansion would send billion of texans taxes to medicaid in other states
burnam said that if texas fails to expand medicaid billion of texas taxpayers money would flow toward insuring the working poor in other states
so in a general sense texas dollars might be a part of any medicaid expansion payment to any state
billion texas would get whether it expands medicaid or not
in a press release burnam said refusing to expand would accomplish nothing except to send billion in federal taxes paid by texans to other states to insure their working poor
