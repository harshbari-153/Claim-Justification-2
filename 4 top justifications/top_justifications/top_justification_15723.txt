"The Supreme Court ruled today NO VOTING BY MAIL !!!"
if you haven t already heard the supreme court ruled today no voting by mail
did the supreme court really strike down voting by mail
and again the court s ruling does not mean there s no voting by mail in texas or anywhere else
supreme court had struck down voting by mail nationwide
about a week after the post was published the supreme court issued a separate ruling on voting in alabama
