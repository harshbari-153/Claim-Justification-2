"The Arizona law basically parrots the federal immigration law."
interestingly the arizona law basically parrots the federal immigration law ganley continued
congressional candidate tom ganley says arizona s new immigration law basically parrots the federal immigration law
i wonder what part of the federal law the obama administration doesn t like ganley s claim about the arizona law parroting federal immigration law itself parrots statements that conservatives have made since the arizona law was adopted
in fact proponents of the arizona law have argued that why new state immigration rules are needed federal authorities are not doing a consistent job of enforcing immigration laws that are already on the books
mary giovagnoli director of the immigration policy center pointed out another aspect of the bill that she finds particularly troubling section of the arizona law would allow citizens to sue local and state authorities if they do not believe the new law is being enforced effectively
