Says a Republican bill he vetoed would have implemented a "mandate" to make public the names of all studentsâ€™ parents or guardians.
i am vetoing this bill in its entirety because i object to implementing a mandate that will negatively impact the privacy of parents of students in wisconsin
while vetoing a pupil records law evers said the law would have mandated that schools release the names of students parents or guardians
he stated that the mandate was his main reason for vetoing the measure
evers misstates schools bill as he vetoes it
veto message
