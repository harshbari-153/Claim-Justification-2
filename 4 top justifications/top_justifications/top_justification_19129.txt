"Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people, which, frankly, to me, that's perhaps the most important number there is."
germany and the united states are the two best in deaths per people which frankly to me that perhaps the most important number there is trump said at a may rose garden press briefing
trump claimed that when it comes to fatalities germany and the united states are the two best in deaths per people
and it is misleading at best to categorize the american fatality count in the same group as germany s germany s numbers are better
trump s comparison of deaths in germany us is wrong
so big picture it is misleading to suggest the united states and germany are in the same league especially when it comes to covid deaths per capita
