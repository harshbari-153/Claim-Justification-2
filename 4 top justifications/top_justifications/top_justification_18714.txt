Proposed NC law for body camera footage gives police "broad authority to keep video footage secret – even from individuals who are filmed."
the aclu said if the bill becomes law police will have broad authority to keep video footage secret even from individuals who are filmed
aclu north carolina police will have significant power to keep body cam dash cam footage secret
giving law enforcement such broad authority to keep video footage secret even from individuals who are filmed will damage law enforcement s ability to build trust with the public and destroy any potential this technology had to make officers more accountable to the communities they serve said aclu attorney susanna birdsong in a news release
we can t see the future so we won t try to say whether keeping video footage secret will damage law enforcement s public image and accountability
but advocates including the state american civil liberties union chapter say the opposite that this bill would give police inordinate power to keep footage shielded from the public
