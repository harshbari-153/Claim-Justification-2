List shows "1,000 peer reviewed studies questioning COVID-19 vaccine safety"
list reads peer reviewed studies questioning vaccine safety
a list published on a blog has a headline that says peer reviewed studies questioning vaccine safety
for other adverse reaction categories the list again pointed to studies that did not question the safety of vaccines
the studies collect interpret and evaluate data about adverse reactions to vaccines per the process with scientific research
far from questioning vaccine safety as the claim says many studies included in this catalog clearly state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the small risk of side effects which are rare
