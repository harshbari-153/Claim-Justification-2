"Russia has never attacked anyone throughout its history."
peskov said russia has never attacked anyone throughout its history
we remind you that russia has never attacked anyone throughout its history dmitry peskov said in an interview on the television channel according to the russian news service tass
as russia s military was surrounding ukraine and threatening to invade russian president vladimir putin s spokesman gave an interview in which he denied that russia had ever invaded any other country
russian spokesman s statement ignores centuries of russian attacks
russia may offer various justifications for why it attacked another country in these instances but contrary to peskov s statement each of these examples did involve militarily unprovoked actions by russia or the soviet union
