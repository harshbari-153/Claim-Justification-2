"Schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year doing test-prep or actual testing."
weingarten said that schools in some states are spending up to days a year doing or actual testing
it is outrageous that schools in some states are spending up to days a year doing or actual testing
with students spending fewer than days in school georgia requires at least days in school the national average requirement is about days the union chief s claim could mean more than half the school year is spent on testing
also what is designated as test prep can vary between educators and could be construed as almost anything taught during the school year as opposed to skills that would not regularly be taught loveless said
schaeffer s organization does not track standardized testing days nationally but has supported legislation in states like washington requiring school systems to post testing schedules so parents can see how much testing must be done
