Says the majority of candidates in Texasâ€™ 25th Congressional District live outside the district.
justin hewlett says the majority of district congressional candidates do not live in district
hewlett s mailer continues in fact the majority of the congressional district candidates reside outside of the district
our ruling our conclusion is that four of the republican candidates not the majority as hewlett says live and vote outside the district
house district running north toward fort worth from western hays and travis counties points out in a recent mailer that members of congress are not required to live in the districts they represent
the unmentioned republican candidates in his analysis are chad wilbanks of austin brian mathews of austin and charlie holcomb of wimberley all presumably living in the district
