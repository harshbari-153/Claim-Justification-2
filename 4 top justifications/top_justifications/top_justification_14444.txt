Says that this year is the first time during his 27 years as senator "that two African Americans have ever served on the same (Senate) committee."
west said it s the first time during his years as senator that two african americans have ever served on the same senate committee
i just want to make sure that i make a note that this is the first time in history during my tenure as senator for the past years that two african americans have ever served on the same committee west said
the first time two black members of the texas senate served together on a standing committee since reconstruction was in
but is it true that west has never served on a committee with another black senator until this year
eleven years later the senate added its second black member
