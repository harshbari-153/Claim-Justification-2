"I ended up my time as governor with a general fund budget that was smaller than the one I started with."
i ended up my time as governor with a general fund budget that was smaller than the one i started with he said during a july debate in hot springs
our ruling kaine said the general fund budget was smaller at the end of his gubernatorial term than at the start
tim kaine says general fund budget shrank when he was governor
despite the reduction the state was spending more money on general fund programs at the end of kaine s term than at the beginning
so the general fund decreased by million or percent from the start to the end of kaine s administration
