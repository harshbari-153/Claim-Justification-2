Says President Barack Obama "is the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore."
ted cruz says barack obama is first president thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore
referring to obama cruz said this president of the united states is the first president we ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore
it is not accurate to say as cruz does that obama would be the first president we ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore
while ilya shapiro a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian cato institute said he believes obama is setting records for the number scope and creativity of unconstitutional and illegal behavior he acknowledged that obama was the first president to violate the law and wo be the last
no one is arguing that president obama is the first to make this mistake
