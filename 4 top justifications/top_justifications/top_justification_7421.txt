Says Chris Dudley thinks Oregonâ€™s minimum wage is too high.
john kitzhaber claims chris dudley finds oregon s minimum wage too high
what chris dudley thinks of oregon s minimum wage is it too low too high or just right has been one of the more contested issues in oregon s heated race for governor
but is kitzhaber right does dudley in his heart of hearts think oregon s minimum wage is too high too low or just right politifact oregon put the question to the dudley camp
the democratic party of oregon followed up with a press release saying that dudley was caught on camera agreeing with a person who thinks the wage is too high
nevertheless any reasonable person watching the original exchange would believe that dudley agrees the minimum wage is too high or at the least problematic despite what his camp says now
