Under a new law regulating abortions, "Even if you're raped, if you don't report it in the first 30 days, the Republicans will force you to have an ultrasound."
in the case of rape even if you raped if you do report it in the first days the republicans will force you to have to have an ultrasound
barca said that a new law passed by republicans regulating abortion deals with sexual assault victims this way even if you raped if you do report it in the first days the republicans will force you to have to have an ultrasound
so it s correct to say that rape victims who seek abortions would be required to have an ultrasound unless they report to police
the new law explicitly grants an exception a waiver in the bill s parlance from ultrasounds when a pregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest or in cases of medical emergencies
democratic leader says ultrasound requirement would apply to some rape victims
