"Health and Human Services admits they have never conducted federally-required monitoring of vaccine safety for over 30 years."
health and human services admits they have never conducted monitoring of vaccine safety for over years the april post says
the facebook post claims that health and human services admits they have never conducted monitoring of vaccine safety for over years
the facebook post goes too far however to say that the agency admitted they have never conducted monitoring of vaccine safety for decades
no health and human services didn t say it failed to monitor vaccine safety
while the agency was unable to locate records responsive to the informed consent action network s public information request we couldn t find evidence that the agency admitted it had failed to monitor vaccine safety for more than years
