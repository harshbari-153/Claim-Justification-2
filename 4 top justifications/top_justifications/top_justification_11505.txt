The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has "been mostly empty" for decades.
donald trump wrong that strategic petroleum reserve has been mostly empty for decades
it s called the strategic national reserves and it hasn t been full for many decades
since about a decade after the strategic petroleum reserve began accepting crude oil the amount stored has not dropped below million barrels by the end of the calendar year
first it s called the strategic petroleum reserve
so after years of being virtually empty i built up our oil reserves during my administration and low energy prices to full trump said
