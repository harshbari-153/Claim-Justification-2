"Kathleen Peters refuses to ‘take a stand’ to repeal Obamacare."
david jolly says kathleen peters won t a stand to repeal obamacare
we wanted to know if the flier is accurate in saying that peters refuses to take a stand to repeal obamacare
peters has repeatedly said she doesn t support the law but doesn t feel it would be good policy to simply strip the affordable care act off the books without addressing some of the problems in the health care system
the mailing quotes peters saying i do not think we should take a stand and say absolutely repeal it
the quote he chose however doesn t include much context or any indication of peters other talking points about obamacare
