David Beckham’s proposed soccer stadium at Miami’s Port "threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries."
the ad said that david beckham s proposed soccer stadium at miami s port threatens the jobs and billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries
david beckham proposed soccer stadium at port threatens jobs and economic impact miami seaport alliance says
it is a challenge to a prediction but we decided to explore the evidence about whether a soccer stadium at the port would threaten the existing jobs and billion economic impact
whether the port generates jobs or jobs the question is whether beckham will interfere with those jobs and i just do see a significant disruption
so hypothetically speaking if the soccer stadium were to create such a morass that cargo and cruise companies jumped ship and fled miami those jobs and economic impact dollars wouldn t vanish into thin air much of it would just move to other ports in florida
