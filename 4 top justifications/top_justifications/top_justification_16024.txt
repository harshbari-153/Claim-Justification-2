"You (Evan Jenkins) said your philosophy was ‘progressive mainstream’ back in 2003."
morrisey said to jenkins you said your philosophy was progressive mainstream back in
in the debate morrisey addressed jenkins and said you said your philosophy was progressive mainstream back in
did evan jenkins once say his philosophy was mainstream
so jenkins definitely said the words progressive mainstream
it s also worth noting that unlike today the term progressive was not used as widely as a for liberal back in
