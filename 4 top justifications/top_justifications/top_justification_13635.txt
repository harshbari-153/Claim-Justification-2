Says JimÂ Renacci has "consistently voted" for loopholes that "encourage outsourcing of our jobs."
so where does this leave the congresswoman s statement sutton said that renacci consistently voted for loopholes that encourage outsourcing of our jobs
betty sutton claims jim renacci consistently supported loopholes that encourage outsourcing
we can also close those loopholes that my opponent has consistently voted for that encourage outsourcing of our jobs and stop
this clashes with sutton s characterization that he consistently encourages outsourcing
democrats called it the outsourcers bill of rights and argued it would make it easier to shift jobs overseas
