"Gas prices have never been higher, and Exxon Mobil's profits have never been higher."
trying to tap the popular ire over gas prices barack obama told an iowa crowd the day after christmas gas prices have never been higher and exxon mobil profits have never been higher
gas prices have soared this year and so have the profits of exxon mobil and other companies
exxon mobil profits have been higher
but obama made his statement more than a month earlier and as we explain above the company had not released record profits at that time nor were gas prices at record highs
does that mean exxon mobil is raking in more dough than ever
