Says "Snoop Dogg arrested for conspiracy after talking about his ‘murder Trump’ video."
a series of fake news articles saying rapper snoop dogg was arrested for encouraging people to shoot president donald trump are all fabricated and can be traced back to one website
snoop dogg wasn t arrested over comments about shooting donald trump in music video
by march the internet was filled with versions of a post on various websites saying snoop had suffered the consequences most with headlines that read snoop dogg arrested for conspiracy after talking about his murder trump video
the fake reporter in the fake story then supposedly told the secret service what snoop said landing snoop in jail
the first amendment allows a lot of leeway for criticism and snoop dogg is hardly the only recording artist to signal his distaste for trump
