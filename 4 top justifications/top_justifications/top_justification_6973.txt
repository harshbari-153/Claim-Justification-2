"The number of Americans who receive means-tested government benefits -- welfare -- now outnumbers those who are year-round full-time workers."
sykes said that the number of americans who receive government benefits welfare now outnumbers those who are workers
according to the new census data the number of americans who receive government benefits welfare now outnumbers those who are workers sykes said
here s the article s first line americans who were recipients of government benefits in outnumbered workers according to data released this month by the census bureau it said
in this we ll look into whether today there are more people getting these benefits than there are workers
to compare them to the number of workers might be useful policy information but to fail to note that children and the elderly not to mention the blind and disabled are folded into the tally of recipients is highly misleading
