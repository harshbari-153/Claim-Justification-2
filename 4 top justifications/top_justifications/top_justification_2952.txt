"Youâ€™re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming."
is it true as brooks said that you re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in antarctica because of global warming
brooks said you re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in antarctica because of global warming
brooks i made a trip down to antarctica and met with national science foundation scientists and they all agreed with global warming and they emphasize that you re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in antarctica because of global warming
brooks would it surprise you to know that if global temperatures rise assuming for the moment that they do that that actually increases the amount of ice that is collected on antarctica
he found significant increases in ice in eastern antarctica
