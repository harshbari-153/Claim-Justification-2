"When Congress voted to condemn Iran for sentencing a Christian pastor to death, (U.S. Rep. Lois) Capps was the only member who voted no."
with a series of dark images and ominous music as a backdrop the ad says among other things when congress voted to condemn iran for sentencing a christian pastor to death capps was the only member who voted no
our ruling the official record does show that capps was the only lawmaker to vote no on the resolution in question but that s not the whole story
we wondered if it was true that capps was really the only lawmaker to vote no on that measure
and condemn the government of iran for its persecution of religious minorities
when the christian post published a story that cited capps no vote an aide to capps contacted the publication which proceeded to run a correction
