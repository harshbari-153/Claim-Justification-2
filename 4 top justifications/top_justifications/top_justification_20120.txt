Says a Bureau of Labor Statistics report attributed a sharp increase in work-related fatalities to "increasing numbers of employees and drivers could not read or understand warning signs in English."
in summary james backed up his claims about concerns over public safety by citing a bureau of labor statistics report that he claimed showed an alarming rise in traffic fatalities due to the fact that increasing numbers of employees and drivers could not read or understand warning signs in english
according to james campaign the federal agency attributed that to increasing numbers of drivers who could not read or understand warning signs in english
but it does say anything about any of those accidents being tied to an inability of drivers to read signs in english
nor could we find news reports of any traffic fatalities in alabama caused by a driver inability to understand a road sign in english
we poked around but could find any study that does suggests a higher rate of traffic accidents fatal or not among people who do not speak english
