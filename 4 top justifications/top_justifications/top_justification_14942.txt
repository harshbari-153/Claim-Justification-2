"Two years ago...I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them [subprime lending] is something we have to deal with."
i wrote to treasury secretary henry paulson i wrote to federal reserve chairman ben bernanke and told them this is something we have to deal with and nobody did anything about it
on the other hand two years ago i said that we got a subprime lending crisis that has to be dealt with
the last sentence appeared to refer to this letter that obama sent to paulson and bernanke on march
obama comments in the debate suggest the letter warned about the subprime lending crisis and its potential impact on the wider economy
and at the second presidential debate obama cited a letter he wrote to federal officials two years ago
