Neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters "knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it."
christie said that neighbors of the san bernardino shooters knew that they were talking about attacking the country
these folks had weapons they knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it christie said
christie says neighbors of san bernardino shooters knew more than they did
they knew they were talking about attacking people christie shot back
there was no mention that a neighbor of the shooters themselves was suspicious much less that a neighbor thought an attack was being planned
