"A vast majority of the production in the United States comes from small independent oil and gas companies."
we wondered whether small independent oil and gas companies actually account for a vast majority of the production in the united states
did you know a vast majority of the production in the united states comes from small independent oil and gas companies and the new rigs that are drilling right now in the united states they are not the exxonmobils of the world
oil production comes not from the biggest multinational oil companies but from independent firms
so we think the suggestion that those companies qualify as small independent oil and gas companies is misleading
dan boren says most domestic oil is produced by small independent companies
