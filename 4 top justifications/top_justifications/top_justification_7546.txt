McCain "voted to cut education funding, against accountability standards. He even proposed abolishing the Department of Education."
that certainly the case with obama ad which claims among other things that mccain voted to cut education funding against accountability standards
on the first point the obama campaign cites a number of examples where mccain did support large increases in education funding backed by democrats but only one case in which mccain actually voted to cut education funding as the ad alleges
given the mccain campaign pledge to fully fund the no child left behind act and in that way endorse the expanded federal role in education that law calls for it seems unlikely mccain has any intention of abolishing the department of education should he be elected
he even proposed abolishing the department of education
it came in when mccain voted for a republican budget resolution calling for a percent cut in the education budget
