"There is absolutely no observed or clinical data that indicates any benefit whatsoever to masking K-12 students in schools."
wilhour said there is absolutely no observed or clinical data that indicates any benefit whatsoever to masking students in schools
we decided to investigate wilhour s claim that there is absolutely no observed or clinical data that indicates any benefit whatsoever to masking students in schools
for the last year at least i contend two years the observed science scores of studies real world observations have told us there is absolutely no observed or clinical data that indicates any benefit whatsoever to masking students in schools
wilhour says no observational or clinical data exists proving benefits of masks in schools
clinical studies can not be conducted on this issue because of the risk they would pose to unprotected children but observational data shows masks are beneficial in reducing transmissions in schools
