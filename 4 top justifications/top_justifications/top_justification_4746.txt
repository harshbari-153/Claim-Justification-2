Thompson "voted against $250,000 caps on damages (and) almost anything that would make our legal system fairer."
he voted against almost anything that would make our legal system fairer pays rules things that would prevent lawsuits like that million lawsuit by that guy who lost his pants
giuliani said thompson voted against caps on damages which they have in texas
giuliani is correct that thompson cast a vote against a cap on punitive damages but that only part of the story
thompson no vote back in was on an amendment to a product liability bill
giuliani claim that his rival opposed loser pays rules is based on thompson vote on the winning side to strip language from the bill that would have forced only the defendants not the plaintiffs to pay attorney and court fees if they refused to settle of court and the refusal was unreasonable or not made in good faith
