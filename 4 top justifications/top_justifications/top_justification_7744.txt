"Roy Cooper's refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money."
roy cooper s refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money so his office must reimburse taxpayers immediately
we wanted to look into mccrory s claim that roy cooper s refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money
pat mccrory said that in the voter id lawsuit attorney general roy cooper s refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money
whether or not cooper s actions are within the scope of his power it s a separate question whether he s costing the state more money by not defending the law
since mccrory hit on a valid topic of debate with his claim about cooper s job duties but missed the mark on his claim about money we rate this claim mostly false
