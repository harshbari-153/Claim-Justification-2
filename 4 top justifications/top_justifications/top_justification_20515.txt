Says the National Labor Relations Board told Boeing that it "can't build a factory in a non-union state."
we decided to examine this question did the nlrb tell boeing that it can t build a factory in a state
our ruling romney claimed that the nlrb told boeing that it can t build a factory in a state
as such he argued boeing violated the national labor relations act which prohibits employers from interfering with the right of workers to organize and to strike
the legal basis for the action centers on whether boeing was trying to punish the union for being willing to call a strike not that boeing had opened a factory in a state
by that i mean you ca have the federal government through its friends at the national labor relations board saying to a company like boeing that you ca build a factory in a state
