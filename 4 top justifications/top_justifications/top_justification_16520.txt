Says Eric Cantor voted to assure Congress would be paid if the government shut down and against guaranteeing troops would be paid.
our ruling powell said that cantor during the threat of a government shutdown last year voted to ensure congress would continue to be paid and against offering the same protection to members of the military
cantor during a period of high political gamesmanship supported republican legislation that in the event of shutdown would have continued military pay and withheld paychecks for congress members
wayne powell says eric cantor voted to protect his pay and against guaranteeing pay to troops
cantor then voted for the underlying bill which included the problematic ban on paying congress during a shutdown
so did cantor really vote against a bill that would have ensured troops get paid as powell said no
