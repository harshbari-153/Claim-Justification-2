"Democrat Maxine Waters has shown up to only 10 percent of congressional meetings for 35 years."
democrat maxine waters has shown up to only of congressional meetings for years read the headline on a june post on teddystick
now the demented democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant reddit user known as has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that her years in congress maxine waters has missed of congressional meetings
maxine waters has not skipped percent of congressional meetings
beyond that it s wrong to say waters missed percent of her congressional meetings even though exactly how those those meetings are defined isn t specified
waters is a legislator but she hasn t been in congress for years
