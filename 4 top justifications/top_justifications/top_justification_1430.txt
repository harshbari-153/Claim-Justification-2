"A single mother of two canâ€™t qualify for basic healthcare through Medicaid if she makes more than $3,504 dollars a year."
missouri attorney general chris koster a democratic gubernatorial candidate recently tweeted a single mother of two can t qualify for basic healthcare through medicaid if she makes more than dollars a year
koster may be off by a little more than when it comes to the maximum income a single mother of two can have and still qualify for medicaid
in other words a woman without children in illinois or arkansas could make around dollars per year and be covered by medicaid but a woman in missouri with two children making above would not
the missouri department of social services charts income guidelines for parents to qualify for medicaid it shows the maximum income to qualify for a family of three is dollars per month or dollars per year
koster does exaggerate income threshold to qualify for medicaid
