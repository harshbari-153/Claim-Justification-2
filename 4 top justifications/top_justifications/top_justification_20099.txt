Says Gov. Jim Doyle and the DNR have not put hunters first and mismanaged the deer herd; as a result "the deer population has dwindled."
in a news release walker claimed that the deer population has dwindled as a result of mismanagement by doyle and the dnr
scott walker says the dnr has mismanaged the state s deer herd and lowered the deer population
in my professional opinion the statement that the deer herd has been mismanaged is wrong said tim van deelen a university of biology professor and expert on deer populations
walker points to political games by doyle and the dnr whom he blames for the state s dwindling deer population
is it true the deer population has dwindled and if so is the frustration of hunter a result of political games and mismanagement in madison we started with walker but his campaign said he was unavailable to talk to politifact wisconsin about the matter
