"Democrats forced our GREAT troops to sleep on the ground of a PARKING garage after dragging them to DC for photo ops!"
a facebook post said democrats forced our great troops to sleep on the ground of a parking garage after dragging them to dc for photo ops
it s absolutely disgusting that the democrats forced our great troops to sleep on the ground of a parking garage after dragging them to dc for photo ops the jan
it came to our attention last night that members of the national guard after standing on duty to protect the capitol for inauguration day keeping us safe were sleeping in parking garages in cramped quarters without proper space or ventilation schumer said jan
but as photographs showing the troops sprawled on the floor circulated on social media so too did unsubstantiated rumors about who was responsible for pushing them out
it did clarify who made the initial request but said the departments are working together to ensure troops could rest in capitol facilities and in hotels
