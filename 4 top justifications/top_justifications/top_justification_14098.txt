the last income tax increase in the state of illinois we saw the largest exodus of families
while arguing against a democratic plan to swap out illinois flat income tax for a series of graduated rates brady said the last time the state increased its income tax we saw the largest exodus of families
at that however the numbers apply not to the last illinois tax increase but the second to the last
illinois has had an income tax for years and rates while bouncing up and down have always been fits all
corrections by his staff aside brady not only referred to the state s most recent tax increase and not the hike but also twice mentioned families in his remarks
