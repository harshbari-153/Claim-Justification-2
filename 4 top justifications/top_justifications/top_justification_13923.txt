jim renacci says that betty sutton gutted medicare by billion with her vote for health care reform
sutton the website said gutted medicare by billion when she voted for the health care reform that is formally known as the affordable care act and informally called obamacare
in this case renacci s website claims sutton s support of health care reform was a vote that gutted medicare by billion
since politifact has examined repeated claims by politicians and interest groups that the health care reform bill would cut medicare by billion
that s not gutting medicare
