chain says welfare programs caused more damage to detroit than the atomic bomb caused to hiroshima
but did welfare cause detroit s problems we put that question to margaret dewar a professor of architecture and urban planning at the university of michigan
the include text that varies from version to version but conveys the same message that welfare is the reason for detroit s problems
you wouldn t think there would be much connection between detroit a troubled rust belt city and the bustling port city of hiroshima japan
if welfare were the problem sugrue said then one could expect to see hollowed out sections of stockholm or paris cities in nations with generous welfare programs
