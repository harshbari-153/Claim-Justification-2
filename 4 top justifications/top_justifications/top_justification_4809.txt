Since Volvo spurned Georgia for South Carolina in early May, some 3,455 jobs promising more than $800 million in investments have come to the Peach State.
but the different deals mean that georgia has not added nearly twice as many jobs since march when volvo said it was going to south carolina
even with an error in the data georgia can count nearly as many jobs and significantly more in investment than was promised by volvo
but in may the tone of the big news changed when volvo rejected georgia and went with south carolina for a new million factory that will employ workers
mixed sports and driving metaphors aside did georgia really manage to bring in even more investment than the volvo factory promised we wanted to see the details
then again it s not as if volvo has already set up shop in the palmetto state and added those jobs
