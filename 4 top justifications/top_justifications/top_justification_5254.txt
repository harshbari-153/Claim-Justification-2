"The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four (from cap and trade) will be $6,800 per year."
the says the congressional budget office supposedly estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four will be per year
they say it will cost so much that it will be a significant burden on a typical american family
in june the cbo released an analysis of the house bill saying that the economywide cost of the program in would be billion or about per household
we explained the pros and cons of the various estimates in those previous items so here we going to look into the chain claim that the cbo estimates will cost a family of four a year
but had the cbo chosen a later date the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more
