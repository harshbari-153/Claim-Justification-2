When the United States invaded Iraq, Saddam Hussein wanted to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and "he said so himself after his capture."
but i do think there any doubt that saddam hussein who had acquired and used weapons of mass destruction before had invaded a neighbor kuwait where we had to fight one war with him that his intent was and he said so himself after his capture to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction
mccain statement was quite specific he said hussein intended to acquire weapons not that he had them
piro a native arabic speaker said that hussein told him he wanted to pursue weapons of mass destruction again
most of what mccain said here has been heavily discussed but we were intrigued by the very last sentence in mccain quote in which he says that hussein had said after his capture that he intended to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction
hussein did say he hoped to get wmd
