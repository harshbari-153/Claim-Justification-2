three years ago a newly elected president obama told america that if congress approved his plan to borrow nearly a trillion dollars he would hold unemployment below percent romney said in his speech in las vegas on feb
our ruling romney did use the word promise as boehner cantor and others did when we checked the same claim previously but the meaning is the same that obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below percent
mitt romney says president promised peak of percent unemployment
it s a common claim by critics of the stimulus bill the spending package obama championed to get the economy going again
promise first we have never found an instance of anyone in the administration making a public pledge to keep unemployment below percent
