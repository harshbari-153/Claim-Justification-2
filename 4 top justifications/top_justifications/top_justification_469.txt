but most of those we spoke with strongly disputed the sweeping statement that so many chronic conditions can be caused by stigma and weight cycling
however she appears to apply this standard selectively using it both to undermine the relationship between high bmi and poor health outcomes and as evidence of how weight cycling and stigma are linked to certain chronic health conditions
current scientific research supports a correlation between being overweight and suffering poor health outcomes but it does not definitively establish causation
