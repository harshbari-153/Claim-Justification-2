"Theyâ€™re furloughing nurses in hospitals in western New York state."
i talked to people in western new york who said they re furloughing nurses in hospitals in western new york state while people in new york city are suffering
we wondered whether his statement that western new york hospitals are furloughing nurses is true
we reached out to hospitals to see if they know of any nursing furloughs in western new york hospitals
we couldn t find any evidence of furloughs of nurses in western new york
the organization has sent a survey to its members to find out how many of those furloughs have occurred said stephanie grolemund president of the new york state association of nurse anesthetists
