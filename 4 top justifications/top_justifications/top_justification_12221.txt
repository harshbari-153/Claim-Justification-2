the democrat plan would it would just obliterate medicare and terminate medicare advantage
trump said the democrat plan would just obliterate medicare and terminate medicare advantage
medicare for all is the most aggressive plan that offers most benefits to seniors but it is certainly not supported by all democrats
while the sanders bill would likely change medicare it would not get rid of it or obliterate it
not all democrats support medicare for all
