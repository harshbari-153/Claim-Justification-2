did gwen graham vote against president obama percent of the time
the collective super pac said graham voted against president obama percent of the time
graham voted against obama s stated policy preference around half the time in but only percent of the time in
we wanted to know if about half of graham s votes really went against what the obama white house wanted
but the group s ad overstates the percentage in which graham voted against what obama wanted by only looking at part of her time in congress
