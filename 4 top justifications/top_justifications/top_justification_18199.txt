"The fact is, in the past year we have had more tax cuts than almost any time in our nation's history."
but back to cohen statement the fact is in the past year we have had more tax cuts than almost any time in our nation history
the fact is in the past year we have had more tax cuts than almost any time in our nation history cohen said in the april tax story
and we note that cohen hedged his claim some by saying there were more tax cuts in the past year than almost any time in our nation history
that may or may not be the largest tax cut in american history it hard to make direct comparisons but tax experts say it at least in the conversation
cohen claims there are more tax cuts this year than almost any other in history
