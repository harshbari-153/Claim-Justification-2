Says a Craigslist ad offered to pay actors to be Trump supporters for a rally.
appears to show a craigslist ad offering to pay people to pose as trump supporters minorities welcome and needed
another ad in october claimed to solicit paid attendees to a trump rally in erie pa
no that craigslist ad offering to pay for trump support is phony
these types of bogus advertisements appear to be intentionally created to make it look like the trump campaign or those affiliated with the president s events need to pay actors to show support
in around a rally the president held in phoenix a similar advertisement soliciting actors to hold signs and cheer on command was shared on the internet
