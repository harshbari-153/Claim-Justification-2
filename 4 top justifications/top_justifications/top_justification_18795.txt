Monkeypox "was created in a lab and given via injection."
contrary to the post s claim monkeypox was not created in a lab and given via injection
no monkeypox wasn t created in a lab
as for the claim that the virus is spread via injection needles are used with lab animals when scientists are investigating a virus mcfadden said but monkeypox didn t start because lab monkeys were injected with the virus
the screenshot from the cdc website says monkeypox was first discovered in when two outbreaks of a disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research hence the name monkeypox
basically people were importing monkeys and occasionally they came infected with monkeypox
