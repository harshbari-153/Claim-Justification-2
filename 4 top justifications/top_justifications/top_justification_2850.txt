"Twenty million Americans are out of work."
the narrator s first words are twenty million americans are out of work and this assertion is bolstered by being repeated in text
kasich s ad said that million americans are out of work
trump said that we have million people out of work
john kasich ad says million americans out of work
this would mean that upwards of million americans could be described with some justification as out of work involuntarily either fully or partially
