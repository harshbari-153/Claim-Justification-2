Says photos show a "boneyard" of electric cars abandoned in France because the carsâ€™ batteries were too expensive to replace.
a viral facebook post that questions whether we need to go green shows rows of electric cars in a field in france and claims the runty were abandoned simply because their batteries had worn out and were too expensive to replace
no electric cars weren t abandoned because batteries too costly to replace
this is a boneyard near paris france with hundreds of electric powered cars
so these green fairy tale electric cars are all sitting in vacant lots while their batteries drain toxins into the ground
first the battery storage cells cost almost double what the vehicle cost new and second no landfill or disposals will allow the batteries to be disposed of there
