"13,000 Floridians are able to vote -- but their governor won't tell them."
the headline of the email stated floridians are able to vote but their governor won t tell them
our ruling the aclu said in the headline of an email floridians are able to vote but their governor wo tell them
as a result there are over floridians who have regained the right to vote but have registered to vote because they may not know that they can
there are a lot of claims in that email but the one we wanted to check was the headline are there floridians able to vote but scott won t tell them restoration of rights changes under crist in
and it s possible some of the don t want to register to vote
