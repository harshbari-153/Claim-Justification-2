"The coronavirus has made it to Mississippi and the lady that caught it wasn’t around nobody with it which means it is airborne. That means if the wind blows it your direction you’ll have it also."
the facebook post says a woman in mississippi was infected by the coronavirus and that it was airborne
facebook post for example that warns the coronavirus has made it to mississippi
the spread of coronavirus via such droplets has been documented
currently there are no confirmed cases in mississippi and while it has been suggested that coronavirus could be airborne it hasn t been documented to spread that way
you may still be able to smell it a while after someone has used it because it s lingering in the air according to the school obviously we re learning a lot about this virus but most coronaviruses aren t airborne this way
