Countries were exporting COVID-19 "diagnostic test instruments" in 2018.
it shows a list of products described as diagnostic test instruments and apparatus next to the countries that export them
the world bank has since revised the title of the table to read medical diagnostic test instruments and apparatus
so why was the table previously billed as a list of diagnostic test exporters
that resulted in what many facebook users are confused about a list of export data about diagnostic testing instruments that appear to predate the coronavirus
but the broad classification which was applied to some testing equipment that predated carried over to a wits database of products related to the virus
