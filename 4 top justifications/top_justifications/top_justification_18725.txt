"Hurricane Irma could be a Category 6 by the time it hits East Coast."
hurricane irma ca be a category storm
into this maelstrom came a website posing as an arm of cnn spoiler it s not posting a page headlined hurricane irma could be a category by the time it hits east coast
a flurry of other questionable websites also played with the idea of irma becoming a category storm
the web post appeared as hurricane irma was powering through the caribbean days ahead of an expected landfall somewhere in florida
these multiple hazards may not be with the category at landfall and therefore it is an incomplete description of the storm destructive potential
