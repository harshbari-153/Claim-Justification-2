"If all of the [Bush-era] tax cuts expire on schedule, the budget will be close to being balanced in four years."
if all of the tax cuts expire on schedule the budget will be close to being balanced in years
bobby scott said the budget will be close to balanced in four years if the bush tax cuts expire on schedule
so let s determine if letting the tax cuts expire and not patching the amt could balance the budget in four years
we must look at the projected annual cost of the tax cuts if extended to determine how much could be saved by allowing them to expire
but with budget deficits projected to hover around trillion a year during that time period the extra tax revenue from allowing the cuts to expire wouldn t even cut the deficit in half in four years much less balance the budget
