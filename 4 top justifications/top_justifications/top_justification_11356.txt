"Just passed into law today: You cannot go 5 miles over speed limit" in North Carolina.
just passed into law today you can not go five miles over speed limit in nc the post read
a facebook post claimed that a new law was passed in north carolina on april that drivers could not go mph over the speed limit and could be stopped for going one mile over it
pump the brakes no law stipulating that drivers can t go miles over limit in north carolina
north carolina like other states follows absolute law which means that a person driving at any speed over the posted limit in an area is in violation of the law
it is not a law because the law already says you can t speed
