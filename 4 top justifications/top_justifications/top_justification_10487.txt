Barack Obama "said in 2004 there was no difference between (Obama) and George Bush on the war."
on the question of obama saying his position on the war is similar to george w
it is wrong that senator obama got to go through debates trumpeting his superior judgment and how he had been against the war in every year enumerating the years and never got asked one time not once how could you say that when you said in you did know how you would have voted on the resolution you said in there was no difference between you and george bush on the war
on iraq on paper there not as much difference i think between the bush administration and a kerry administration as there would have been a year ago obama said
clinton argument is that obama opposition to the war has been consistent
bush we find that bill clinton is quoting the essence of obama statement but leaving out important context
