Rep. David Cicilline is responsible for the federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, the failed solar company
david cicilline is responsible for the federal loan guarantee to solyndra the failed solar company
this puzzled us because cicilline took office in well after the federal stimulus package that financed solyndra s loan guarantee was passed and well after the decision was made to award solyndra the loan guarantee
there s been a lot of lately in washington over the obama administration s decision to give a federal loan guarantee to solyndra a solar power manufacturer
not only is cicilline responsible for this irresponsible investment but he ll also have to explain to his rhode island constituents why solyndra s senior employees are receiving bonuses at the expense of american taxpayers
cicilline took office in january a full months after passage of the bill enacting the loan guarantee program that benefited solyndra
