The proposal by President Joe Biden would put the U.S. "No. 2 in the world" for the highest corporate tax rate.
here s a list of the top corporate tax rates in the world if biden s proposal was enacted as is
by their calculations biden s proposed combined corporate tax rate would rank in the world
strictly speaking blunt is incorrect if biden s proposal is enacted as is at least countries would still have a higher corporate tax rate when national and tax rates are combined
if you instead compare the united states to other advanced industrialized nations blunt has a point the combined national and tax rate under biden s proposal would be higher than any other oecd country and the national tax rate alone would rank in the top of oecd countries
in the world for the highest corporate tax rate
