Says Catherine Cortez Masto "was happy to line her own pockets with taxpayer dollars when state employees were slammed with frozen salaries."
the nrsc said cortez masto was happy to line her own pockets with taxpayer dollars when state employees were slammed with frozen salaries but this is a highly misleading claim
the fact is that as attorney general when state workers were furloughed catherine cortez masto stood with them and voluntarily donated tens of thousands of dollars of her salary back to the taxpayers he said in a statement
as shown it s clear that as attorney general cortez masto didn t pad her pockets while state workers suffered rather she received essentially the same salary not counting benefits during her eight years in office when donations are subtracted out
the state increased cortez masto s salary during a time of pay freezes for nevada s state workers
general cortez masto accepted a percent pay raise increasing her salary from to annually even as other nevada elected officials declined the salary hike
