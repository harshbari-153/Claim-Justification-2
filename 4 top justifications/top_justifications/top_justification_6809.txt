Says Washingtonâ€™s Kim Schrier has a plan to eliminate employer-provided health coverage, double income taxes and put your care "in the hands of government bureaucrats."
the nrcc says kim schrier s medicare for all plan would eliminate health coverage put your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats and require historic tax increases
kim schrier s plan will put your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats and require historic tax increases for washington families
so on what does the nrcc base its claim that schrier would eliminate your employer coverage put your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats and require historic tax increases
schrier s medicare would be handled through state health care exchanges the affordable care act marketplaces with private individual and plans offered as well
it is true that schrier said look ultimately i think we do need to go to a medicare for all system but she then said a lot more and the ad ignores it all instead citing criticisms of a specific plan she doesn t support and those criticisms themselves are in dispute
