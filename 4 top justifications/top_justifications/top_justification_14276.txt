Says her health care plan would "ensure Americans with preexisting conditions are protected."
loeffler said her health care plan would ensure americans with preexisting conditions are protected
one provision would establish guaranteed coverage plans to help cover patients with preexisting conditions
her guaranteed coverage plans provision would seem to indicate she will have a plan that does not cover preexisting conditions but then she will offer a special plan that will laszewski said alluding to plans that tended to offer very limited and very expensive coverage
health care consultant robert laszewski noted that loeffler s proposal has a specific plan for those who want their preexisting conditions covered whereas all individual plans in the aca s exchanges cover preexisting conditions
the fact that people with preexisting conditions would need separate plans sends a strong signal that they would no longer be guaranteed coverage or community rates in marketplace plans as they are under the aca and it seems likely that these plans would work like the pool plans said law professor wendy netter epstein director of depaul university s health law institute
