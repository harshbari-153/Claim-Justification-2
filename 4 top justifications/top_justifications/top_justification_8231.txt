The Affordable Care Act "basically puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create."
boehner said the health care law basically puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create
chief amongst those i would argue is obamacare which basically puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create
john boehner says obamacare a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create
so when boehner said obamacare basically puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create it s a significant exaggeration by the numbers
boehner s concern that there would be a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create stems from a provision in the law known as the employer mandate which levies a penalty on employers if they fail to offer their workers health insurance
