A Republican budget proposal "would have Wisconsin have the weakest standards for who can be a teacher in the classroom in the country."
tate declared that a republican budget proposal would have wisconsin have the weakest standards for who can be a teacher in the classroom in the country
then he flatly stated just yesterday you saw slipped into the budget a provision that would have wisconsin have the weakest standards for who can be a teacher in the classroom in the country
gop plan would give wisconsin weakest standards in for hiring teachers democrat mike tate says
let s see if the changes which as we ll see apply only to teachers in middle and high school would leave wisconsin with the weakest teacher standards in the country
if wisconsin changes their requirements he said referring to the republican proposal i m not sure about the weakest but it certainly would be one of the lowest requirements
