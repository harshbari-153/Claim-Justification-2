Says he saw videotape "of the people taking the money off the plane" to pay ransom to Iran for hostages.
trump said he had seen videotape of the people taking the money off the plane to pay ransom to iran for hostages
and remember this iran i do think you heard this anywhere but here iran provided all of that footage the tape of taking that money off that airplane right million in cash
and they have a perfect tape done by obviously a government camera and the tape is of the people taking the money off the plane right that means that in order to embarrass us further iran sent us the tapes right it a military tape
for two days donald trump told rally audiences a detailed account of seeing video footage of stacks of cash being taken off an airplane destined to pay iran for the release of american hostages
in other words trump had seen widely reported video footage of the hostages being released but described it in some detail and incorrectly as showing stacks of money being unloaded from a plane
