"Barack Obama and Joe Biden oppose new drilling at home and oppose nuclear power."
yet barack obama and joe biden oppose new drilling at home and oppose nuclear power
it true that obama and biden have opposed expanded offshore drilling in the past
the rnc is on considerably shakier ground when it says obama and biden oppose nuclear power
they oppose drilling but not nuclear energy
however obama has said that he would accept drilling as part of a compromise bill that enacts broader energy reforms
