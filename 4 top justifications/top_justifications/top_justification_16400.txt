Says Gov. Chris Christie has embarked on a tour to "demand that New Jerseyâ€™s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest."
barbara buono says chris christie embarked on a tour to demand the state legislature approve a tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthiest people
our ruling buono said that christie embarked on an endless summer tour to demand that new jersey s democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest
but under the plan christie now supports the plan he signed onto before kicking off his tour of new jersey to blast democrats for not approving a tax cut that s not the case since some wealthy individuals would not even qualify for a tax cut
being honest about the numbers would undermine the endless summer tour that christie has embarked on to demand that new jersey s democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest regardless of whether the state can afford it buono wrote
although christie initially proposed in january to cut income taxes percent over three years he backed off that proposal before the start of his endless summer tour
