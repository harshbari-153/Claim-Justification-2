"We have lost over $1 billion in not taking the Medicaid expansion money, only to insure fewer people."
we have lost over billion in not taking the medicaid expansion money only to insure fewer people moore said in an the interview on milwaukee s channel
the second part of moore s claim is that the decision to pass on the full medicaid expansion caused the state to insure fewer people
medicaid move decreased number of people covered
we checked a similar billion claim in june when candidate dana wachs said walker has turned down billion of medicaid money
walker who has criticized the full expansion as essentially a new form of welfare did institute a partial medicaid expansion so for the first time everyone in wisconsin living below the federal poverty level was eligible for medicaid
