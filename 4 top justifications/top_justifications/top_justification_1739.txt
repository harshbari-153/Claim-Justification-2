Says President Obama waited two weeks to call the attack in Libya "terror."
romney says obama waited days to call libya attack terror
our ruling romney said it took the president days before he called the libya attack terror
so while obama did use the word terror there is also some truth to romney point that it took many days for the administration to fully characterize the attack as the work of a terrorist group
during the second presidential debate mitt romney charged that it took the president days before he called the attack in benghazi an act of terror
in the days since some have parsed obama remarks and argued he did say the benghazi attack was specifically an act of terror
