"Ninety-four percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no online disclosure."
that percent of the bills that pass the senate have no debate no vote no amendments no reading of the bill no online disclosure and very often no score from the congressional budget office
and what this means is percent of the bills that pass the senate have no debate no vote no amendments no reading of the bill no online disclosure and very often no score from the congressional budget office
indeed those unfamiliar with senate procedures might be shocked to learn that even percent of legally binding bills passed the chamber without debate
speaking about legislative openness demint said that congress is plagued with secrecy and lack of debate on important issues at this point in the senate percent of all the bills are passed unanimous consent percent
doing this would mean that percent of binding bills received absolutely no debate
