Portland Public Schools invites "well-paid, well-fed school bureaucrats, administrators, teachers, other staff, non-needy students, affluent parents of students, and other adults, including on the other extreme the adult homeless, illegal aliens, fanatical Muslim terrorists, or drug addicted street people, to enjoy cheap breakfasts in taxpayer-paid school facilities amidst school children."
it is quite another thing and a wrongful thing to invite school bureaucrats administrators teachers other staff students affluent parents of students and other adults including on the other extreme the adult homeless illegal aliens fanatical muslim terrorists or drug addicted street people to enjoy cheap breakfasts in school facilities amidst school children
portland public schools invites all adults for a cheap breakfast
so why does portland public schools subsidize meals for children and provide meals to adults who clearly can afford to pay more the answer given by the district is that it s more in the end to sell more meals since there is a minimum anyway for labor and supplies
lloyd is livid that west sylvan middle school portland public schools is advertising breakfasts for students and adults
clearly the breakfast offer is not intended for the general public which means no drug addicts homeless or suspected terrorists domestic or otherwise get to mingle with the kids unless they happen to be staff or parents at the school
