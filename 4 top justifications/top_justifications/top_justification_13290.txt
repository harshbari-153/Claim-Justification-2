Says Barack Obama is a "hypocrite" for criticizing President George W. Bushâ€™s "drone attack program," then using it aggressively as president.
but fleming was wrong when he cited the drone attack program as evidence that obama was a hypocrite
so we decided to check whether obama had expressed opposition to using drones to assassinate terrorist targets prior to becoming president
bromund added that obama s disinclination to curb drone attacks has been widely criticized on the left so much so that the administration had to assign harold koh the state department legal adviser to defend it publicly in a march address to the american society of international law
we find no evidence to support the claim that candidate obama opposed drone strikes on terrorist targets and no hypocrisy when he increased the frequency of those strikes well beyond what bush his predecessor did
a white house spokesman told us that candidate obama hadn t criticized drone attacks
