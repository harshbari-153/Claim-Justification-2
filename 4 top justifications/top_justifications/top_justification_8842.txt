A doctor at the Mayo Clinic is misdiagnosing pregnancies of Trump supporters so they have abortions.
the tweet from user drnifkin says when trump supporters come to my office at the mayo clinic i love misdiagnosing their healthy pregnancies as ectopic so they have to abort their white fetuses
an instagram post that s a screenshot of a tweet says a doctor at the mayo clinic is targeting trump supporters for unnecesary abortions
hoax claim about mayo clinic trump supporters and ectopic pregnancy is still false
at that time a spokesperson for the mayo clinic told the ap there was no doctor by that name at the clinic and the information was false
the mayo clinic said at that time there is no doctor by that name at the clinic and the information had come from a troll operating a parody account
