"We know this now. The banks no longer loan (Donald Trump) money because he's a terrible risk. So he goes to these (Russian) oligarchs and borrows money."
banks are no longer loaning trump money and trump is trying to get it from russian oligarchs
so he goes to these oligarchs and borrows money
so we went looking for some evidence on the question of who is lending trump money
but the issue for this is borrowing money and we could find any evidence that trump has been getting loans from any oligarchs
similarly there little evidence to show that trump has been seeking loans from oligarchs instead of financial institutions
