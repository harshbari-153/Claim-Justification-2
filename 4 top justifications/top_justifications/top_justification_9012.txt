Robert Hurt supported a bill that helped the uranium industry after taking contributions from the industry and because his father had a stake in it.
his father also contributed to his campaigns but those donations came before the elder hurt invested in uranium
maybe it s because hurt s father has a financial interest in uranium mining or because hurt has taken thousands from uranium interests
all of the father s donations were made before when henry hurt said he began exploring investing in mining for uranium
the conservation groups also based the claim on in contributions made to hurt over five years by his father who presumably had plenty of reasons other than uranium mining for supporting his son
conservation groups accuse robert hurt of on uranium vote
