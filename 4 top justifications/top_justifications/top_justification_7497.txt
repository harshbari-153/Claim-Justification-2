Says Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget "roadmap … doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and … adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt between now and then."
as congressional leaders and the white house negotiate over the next federal budget we thought we d check whether miller fairly characterizes ryan s proposal specifically whether it s true that ryan s roadmap does balance the budget until the and adds an unthinkable trillion to the national debt
as can never be said often enough ryan is absurdly hailed as a fiscal conservative for a roadmap that does balance the budget until the and that adds an unthinkable trillion to the national debt between now and then
yes ryan plan may allow trillion of debt but that is far far far less than what would happen under current law
it s true as he says that ryan s plan does balance the budget until the and before it gets there it will probably add trillions of dollars in debt
how about miller s claim that ryan would add trillion to the debt we couldn t find a trillion figure in either ryan s roadmap or in the cbo analysis
