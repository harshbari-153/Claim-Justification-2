It "is Hillary Clinton's agenda" to "release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released."
trump said it is hillary clinton agenda to release the violent criminals from jail
he continued this is hillary clinton agenda too to release the violent criminals from jail
donald trump wrong that hillary clinton wants to release all violent criminals from prison
but even if clinton is sidestepping a thorny issue by remaining largely silent on which if any inmates deserve early release that position does throw a wrench into trump s accusation that it s her stated agenda to release violent criminals
this consistent focus on nonviolent offenders undermines the notion that clinton wants to release violent offenders at all much less to do so
