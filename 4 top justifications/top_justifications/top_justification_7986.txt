Per-student K-12 state funding for Portland Public Schools has dipped from $6,036 in the 2007-2008 school year to $5,644 in the 2010-2011 school year
what we really wanted to know was this has state school funding per student really dropped from in to to after phone calls to portland public schools the oregon department of education and the legislative fiscal revenue office and winding up with different figures from each our collective head was spinning with numbers
we noticed right away that the numbers in the brochure were probably referring to portland public schools funding and not oregon funding generally
portland public schools paints picture of declining state funding over past few years
before we made our ruling we had one lingering thought what does the overall portland public schools budget look like well according to their website their total funds budget is actually up million this year compared to million in
so we adjusted our search and began calculating state funding for portland public over the past few years
