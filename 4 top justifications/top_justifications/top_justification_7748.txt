"Senator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power."
senator obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power mccain said
obama has said that nuclear power has to be part of our energy mix in attaining energy independence though it does require environmental safeguards
obama not keen on drilling but not against nuclear power
however just last month obama said he would accept some drilling as part of a compromise bill that enacts broader energy reforms
so mccain statement about obama is more accurate with respect to offshore drilling but not accurate on nuclear energy
