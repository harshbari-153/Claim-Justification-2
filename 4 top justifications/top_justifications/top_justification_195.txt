"I've traveled the country advocating for the FairTax ..."
i ve traveled the country advocating for the fairtax along with herman cain neal boortz and john linder graves a former state representative said at an april candidate debate at the georgia mountains center in gainesville
when asked whether they made other trips to talk about the fairtax the graves campaign focused on that missouri trip as proof that their candidate is correct
we asked graves campaign officials whether they thought their candidate was exaggerating things a bit by saying he traveled the country in support of the idea
and congressional district candidate tom graves seemed to be on the same page regarding their support for the fairtax particularly since they spoke in favor of the idea at an event in missouri in june
tom graves is telling you that he has traveled the nation with john linder to sell the fairtax
