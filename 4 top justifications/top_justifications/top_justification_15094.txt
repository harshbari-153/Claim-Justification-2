While in the Illinois Senate, Barack Obama passed legislation moving people "from welfare to jobs."
obama sponsored welfare law
here we look at a claim we checked previously that obama moved people from welfare to work
it what he did in the illinois senate moving people from welfare to jobs passing tax cuts for working families and making sure women get equal pay for equal work
nevertheless the legislation primary role was welfare reform and the legislative record shows that obama had a leadership role in getting it passed
this is the first time obama has referred to illinois laws as if he passed them singlehandedly
