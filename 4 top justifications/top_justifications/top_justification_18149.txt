Says no one from the Bush family attended the 2012 Republican National Convention and "there was no President Bush" at the 2008 convention.
priebus said it s not a big deal a bush isn t attending the convention because a bush didn t speak in and there was no president bush at the convention
bush all declined to participate or attend the nominating convention
the earliest convention we could find without a bush speaking was in where gerald ford was selected as the republican nominee
priebus added after some that that there was no president bush at the rnc in
it s been nearly eight years since a bush has held national elected office but the family has maintained a role at the nominating convention
