"In 1960, most black children were raised in two-parent, monogamous families." Today "we have only 20 percent of black children being raised in two-parent, monogamous families..."
in most black children were raised in monogamous families
by now by this time we have only percent of black children being raised in monogamous families with a married man and woman raising those children
his claim focused on the percentage of black children raised in married families
jackson said in most black children were raised in married households and now only percent of them live in households
in about of black children were living with two parents so that part of jackson s statement is correct
