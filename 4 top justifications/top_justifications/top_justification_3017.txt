"If you want to talk firsts for Bush, this was the first time in American history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes."
i mean this was if you want to talk firsts for bush this was the first time in american history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes
krugman says bush was first president to lead country into war and cut taxes
and we think krugman also has some wiggle room on that second point because he said bush was the first president who took us into a war and cut taxes
as the talk about the price tag for the war in afghanistan heats up we thought it would be worthwhile to take a look at krugman claim about bush being the first to cut taxes after leading the country into war and to add some context
curious though foster said whether krugman is arguing we should have raised taxes when the economy was experiencing a jobless recovery and by implication arguing we should raise taxes now or whether he is trying to say obama is just like bush since if bush was the first to do this then obama was the second
