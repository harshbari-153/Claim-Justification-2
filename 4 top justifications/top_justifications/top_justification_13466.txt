"Of those 850,000 (new Texas) jobs, most were public-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs."
we wondered how many of those jobs were created on perry watch per white claim that most of the employment gains touted by the governor were jobs that paid minimum wage or were in the public sector
however bill white told the texas tribune of those jobs most were jobs and jobs
bill white says most jobs added during rick perry tenure were government or minimum wage
our calculation of the increase in jobs in texas during perry tenure did match white
to prove white statement that most more than percent of the new jobs were and minimum wage an additional would have had to be jobs that paid at or below minimum wage
