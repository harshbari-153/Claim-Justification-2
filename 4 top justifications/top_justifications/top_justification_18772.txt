Teachers "are working their third consecutive year -- some longer than that -- without salary increases."
let s review boitnott said virginia teachers are working their third consecutive year some longer without a salary increase
so it is accurate to say that teachers are in their third school year without a raise from the state
it would be accurate to say most teachers are going without a pay raise for the second straight school year
there are strong indications however that this school year also has been difficult for teachers
during good years both entities usually kick in money for teachers
