Congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but "zero on job creation."
but the post s most important flaw is the contention that republicans have offered zero bills on job creation
blog post says gop has sponsored zero job creation bills
the numbers cited in the post include democratic bills and the definition of what constitutes a job creation bill is open to significant debate
our ruling while congressional republicans have certainly introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics the claim that the gop has focused on issues other than job creation just is supported
so it s wrong for the post to say that republicans have introduced that many bills
