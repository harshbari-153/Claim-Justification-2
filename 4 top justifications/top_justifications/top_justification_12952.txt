Says Johns Hopkins virologist "James Kelly" said the COVID-19 vaccine "discriminates, divides, and judges society as it is."
i have never seen a vaccine like this one which discriminates divides and judges society as it is
a long statement is being shared on social media that looks critically at vaccines relative to other vaccines
no evidence johns hopkins doctor said this about vaccines
and as the social fabric it s a powerful vaccine she does all the things except immunization
searching for part of the quote online we found no results that supported the claim that a johns hopkins virologist named james kelly or anyone with johns hopkins medicine said this
