Says Ohio law gives tax breaks "to rich people who own private jets."
mike foley says ohio gives tax breaks to rich people who own jets
ohio law contains tax breaks that cost the state about billion per year in lost revenue it otherwise would collect according to the department of taxation
we re giving tax breaks to guys that own private jets that doesn t make any sense
a listener hearing foley s quip about tax breaks for rich people buying private jets could believe he was referring to anyone who buys a private plane
among the tax exemptions in the report is one for people who buy a share of a private jet or what is called a aircraft
