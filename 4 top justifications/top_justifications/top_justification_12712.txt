"We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care."
we the bishops of the united states can you believe it in came out for more affordable more comprehensive more universal health care
we wondered whether the bishops support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century
he s correct that the national catholic welfare council published expansion literature that year and experts told us that the bishops have regularly supported proposals to expand health care over the years despite disagreements over specific provisions enacted under obama including contraception regulations
that s where it comes to appear that they re against universal health care
bishops discussed national policy issues such as education welfare and health care
