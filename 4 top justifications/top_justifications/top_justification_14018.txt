Says Donald Trump said, "The doctors said they’ve never seen a body kill the coronavirus like my body. They tested my DNA and it wasn’t DNA. It was USA."
the doctors said they ve never seen a body kill the coronavirus like my body reads the text over an image of trump speaking

trump has not said dna since jan
they tested my dna and it wasn t dna
searching for the quote on google we only found two pages of results none of them credible sources to support that trump said this
