"The government is going to tell Americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with 'government-certified' stoves and use taxpayer dollars to do so."
which deals with a government program on wood stoves caught our eye the government is going to tell americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with stoves and use taxpayer dollars to do so
the government is not going to tell americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with stoves
from the sound of this claim it seems like the government would demand all wood stoves be replaced we imagine packs of bureaucrats knocking down doors and tearing wood stoves out of walls
however the government is not forcing them to replace the stoves
so republicans are right that taxpayer money is being used to subsidize upgraded stoves but they are distorting how the program works
