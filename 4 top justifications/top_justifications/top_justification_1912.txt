"Before this law, any group could go out anywhere, register voters, sit on the voter registration forms for unlimited amount of time."
before this law any group could go out anywhere register voters sit on the voter registration forms for unlimited amount of time
our ruling before the registration law was imposed curry explained that any group could go out register voters sit on the voter registration forms for unlimited amount of time
if voter registration groups were sitting on registrations for unlimited amounts of time even before the new measure they were breaking the law
voter registration groups could sit on registrations before a new law says rpof chair lenny curry
actually the prior law had a rule for turning in voter registrations
