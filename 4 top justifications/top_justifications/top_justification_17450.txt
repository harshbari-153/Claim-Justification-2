"The FBI is involved in an investigation about people in the Rio Grande Valley who are using cocaine to buy votes."
abbott said the fbi is involved in an investigation about people in the rio grande valley who are using cocaine to buy votes
a moment later abbott said i almost hesitate to bring this up but you know that one of the challenges that s going on as we speak is the fact that the fbi is involved in an investigation about people in the rio grande valley who are using cocaine to buy votes
the story was based on court filings indicating the fbi was looking into allegations that a hidalgo county commissioner s campaign manager had used cocaine to draw votes in the primary election
we asked michelle lee an fbi spokeswoman in san antonio if trades of cocaine for votes remain under investigation
we wondered is the government checking into ongoing trades of cocaine for votes
