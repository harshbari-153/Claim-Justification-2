"Deepwater's own testimony . . . is they said they'll create six jobs."
but we can check whether deepwater itself said that only six jobs would be created
deepwater own testimony at the puc after a hearing publicly held at the forum that the governor chose is they said they create six jobs lynch said during a june appearance on the newsmakers television program when he was running for governor
deepwater which lynch himself cites as a credible source when it comes to the jobs number is also promising at least construction jobs
so deepwater is saying there will be six positions to maintain the eight wind turbines
the key answer about jobs came from william moore ceo of deepwater wind
