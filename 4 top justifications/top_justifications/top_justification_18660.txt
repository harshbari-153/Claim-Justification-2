Sen. Joe Lieberman's "home state has a public option which covers about 10,000 of its citizens that was introduced by its Republican governor."
olbermann said lieberman was being hypocritical because he will side with the republicans denying americans an vote on any health care plan that includes the public option even though his home state has a public option which covers about of its citizens that was introduced by its republican governor
olbermann claims connecticut has a public plan

joe lieberman former democrat and now independent from connecticut made headlines recently when he said he would join republicans in a filibuster against a health care bill with a public option
