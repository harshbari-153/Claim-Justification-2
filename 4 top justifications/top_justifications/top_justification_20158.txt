Says people are moving to Milwaukee "in record numbers"
feigin said people are moving to milwaukee in record numbers
are the bucks accurate are people moving to the city in record numbers
still to be fair we don t know how many more people might move to milwaukee during the rest of
so is this the most people that have moved to milwaukee ever
since that old census data doesn t get more granular than breaking things down by decade it s difficult to know exactly how many people moved to milwaukee in a given year during that time
