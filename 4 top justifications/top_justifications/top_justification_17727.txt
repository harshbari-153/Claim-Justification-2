A Craigslist ad was soliciting "anti-Trump" protesters in Phoenix.
you may have seen a post on social media that displays a screenshot of a supposed craigslist ad soliciting protesters to hold signs at an event in phoenix for an hour
no this craigslist ad for paid protesters is phony
related a history of hoaxes fake craigslist ads that solicit minority actors for trump rallies
there is a history of similar craigslist ads being shared online that are unaffiliated with the trump campaign
liberals and conservatives have accused each other of paying supporters and protesters to show up at political events but these advertisements appear to be created to stoke anger from the other side of the aisle
