Says U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson "admitted" that Washington, D.C., "changed" him into an insider selling his influence to make millions from powerful special interests.
but we re examining the claim that thompson candidly admitted being changed by washington into a corporate influence peddler
our rating in claiming that thompson admitted he had been changed by washington and had sold out to make millions the ad jumbles a snippet from a quote about the failings of himself and other gop officials while running washington with his actions after leaving government service
amid generic images of corporate the spot says thompson sold his influence and connections becoming a partner in a powerful washington lobbying firm working for wall street and the big drug companies making millions from the special interests at our expense
we noted the connection when we checked a claim by thompson s gop primary rival eric hovde that thompson is a big corporate lobbyist and has been lobbying during the middle of the campaign
therefore thompson s washington changed us was an admission that such deals with special interests were wrong canter said
