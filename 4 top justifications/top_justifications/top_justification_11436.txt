"In other states (where illegal immigrants have been allowed to get driver's licenses) their insurance premiums for everybody have gone down."
raimondo said that in states where illegal immigrants have been allowed to get driver licenses the insurance premiums for everybody have gone down
when you see that actually in other states their insurance premiums for everybody have gone down
we wondered whether raimondo was correct that states that have granted licenses to illegal immigrants have seen automobile insurance premiums decrease for everyone
if allowing undocumented immigrants to get a license and requiring them to have insurance produces a big drop in the percentage of uninsured motorists that would reduce the uninsured motorist premium
it did directly look at whether insurance rates go down when licenses are granted but it tried to estimate the costs of denying licenses to undocumented immigrants
