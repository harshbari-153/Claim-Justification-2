Says an image shows a satellite view of fires in Australia.
that s different than an actual satellite image of australia which does not show glow from the fires at a continental view
it is possible to see smoke from the fires on some closer satellite images
the photo isn t a satellite image of australia it s a digital visualization of fire data
a map from firms that shows the locations of active fires in australia also helps place hearsey s digital visualization in context
pray for us please the user wrote alongside the image which shows bright orange spots where fires are purportedly burning across the continent
