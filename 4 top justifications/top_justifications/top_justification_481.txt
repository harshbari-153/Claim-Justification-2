Says Erv Nelson voted "yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urgingÂ Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country."
why did erv nelson vote yes on the sjr a bill urging congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country
seaman says nelson voted yes on the sjr a bill urging congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country
so claiming nelson voted for a bill that included support for a pathway to citizenship is accurate as the resolution clearly spells out
in response to questions from politifact seaman s campaign sent a letter arguing that a pathway to citizenship is equal to amnesty as citizenship is a measure of permanent legal relief targeted at a specific group of people
it s true that granting citizenship to people not legally in the country would prevent punishments like deportation and broadly serve as amnesty but the resolution is just so vague that it s difficult to call it
