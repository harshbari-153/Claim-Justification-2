President Barack Obama "said over 20 times he did not have the legal authority" to act as he did on immigration.
mccaul said obama said over times he did not have the legal authority to act as he did on immigration
michael mccaul says obama said times he lacked authority to act alone on immigration
let s turn next to obama statements from boehner s list that seem to support mccaul s claim that obama didn t think he had independent legal authority to act on immigration some made before the directive came out
upshot about of the tallied obama statements suggest obama didn t think he had the power to do more on immigration by himself hence backing up mccaul s statement
in an april speech in miami and the next month in el paso obama said he couldn t bypass congress and change immigration laws himself saying that s not how a democracy works
