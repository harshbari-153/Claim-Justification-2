When SACS came back to the DeKalb County School District to give a midterm review, we got straight Aâ€™s.
when sacs came back at midterm for review we got straight a s thurmond said during a meeting with parents earlier this month
so was dekalb schools superintendent michael thurmond correct that the district s midterm review from an accrediting agency back in may resulted in a report card
in may a sacs team returned to dekalb for a review as thurmond noted during the parent meeting
we also checked with the georgia school boards association which helps boards prepare for sacs visits for thoughts on thurmond s statement
we asked thurmond s office about the superintendent s claim and reading of the sacs report
