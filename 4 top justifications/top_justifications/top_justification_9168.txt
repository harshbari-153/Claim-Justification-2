Says Ted Kennedy met "with the KGB in order to beat Ronald Reagan in 1984."
gutfeld said that kennedy met with the kgb in order to defeat ronald reagan in
there is certainly evidence that kennedy attempted to meet with soviet officials but it was with the approval of the reagan white house
in reagan himself approved using kennedy this way and a working relationship grew between kampelman and kennedy
he said that while he had made many trips to moscow over the years and knew people in the kgb the only political topic kennedy ever asked him to broach with the soviets was a deal to release dozens of dissidents
nothing will ever come close to ted kennedy meeting with the kgb in order to beat ronald reagan in gutfeld said on his show july
