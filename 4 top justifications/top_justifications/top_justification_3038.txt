remember in the city of milwaukee we ve still got a mayor and a police chief who are furloughing police officers at a time when we have violence all across the city
robin vos says milwaukee is furloughing police officers at a time when violence is happening across the city
vos said the mayor and police chief were furloughing police officers
in the wake of the may shooting on a milwaukee playground that left a girl gravely wounded a familiar debate rekindled are there enough cops are on the street
so is vos right are cops being kept off the street
