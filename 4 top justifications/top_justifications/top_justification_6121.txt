Joe Biden "really did wipe away" student loan debt.
wow just checked my credit karma and biden really did wipe away my student loans worth of debt the user wrote
joe biden has not canceled student loan debt
but those plans have not yet come to fruition and biden hasn t said he d cancel student loans for everyone
biden has extended a pause on federal student loan payments but none of the executive orders he has signed so far follow through on his campaign promises
we can t speak to what may have happened to the facebook user s student loan debt but the post that credits biden for wiping it away is inaccurate
