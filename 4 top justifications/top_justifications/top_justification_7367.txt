"If you look at the application for a security clearance, I have a clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain because of my background."
and i tell you if you look at the application for a security clearance i have a clearance that even the president of the united states can not obtain because of my background
but what about him having a clearance that even the president of the united states can not obtain
the first is that west is saying that he had a higher security clearance than someone occupying the office of president of the united states
still even using this logic west oversteps when he says that his own clearance is one that even the president of the united states can not obtain
if in theory obama was not president and decided to apply for a security clearance there no guarantee he qualify for one
