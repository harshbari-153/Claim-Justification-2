Dan Webster supports "privatization of Social Security, deep cuts in Social Security."
but we decided to look at her specific example that republican candidate for congress dan webster supports privatization of social security deep cuts in social security
debbie wasserman schultz says daniel webster supports privatization cuts to social security
wasserman schultz said that republicans support privatization of social security deep cuts in social security and gave webster as an example
the statement did provide any evidence backing wasserman schultz claim that webster supports privatization but it does mention cutting increases for entitlement programs which include social security and medicare
webster comments at the forum gave the impression he supported cuts but he did specifically mention social security and later he specifically said he did support cuts to the program
