Says Winston Churchill said, "When you’re 20, you care what everyone thinks, when you’re 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you’re 60, you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place."
when you re you care what everyone thinks when you re you stop caring what everyone thinks when you re you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place reads a quote posted march that s attributed to churchill
no winston churchill did say this quote about age
post titled all the quotes winston churchill never said
winston churchill once said it s a good thing for an uneducated man to read a book of quotations
we live by the facts and having not found any proof that churchill made this statement we rate this facebook post false
