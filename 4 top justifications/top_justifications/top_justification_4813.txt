Health proposal would create a "40% tax on health care benefits of middle-class workers."
the ad says the proposal is a tax on health care benefits of workers
some senators say they want to tax health care plans but those proposals will also tax the benefits of millions of workers
another point worth emphasizing is that the percent tax is on the portion of the health plan that exceeds for individuals and for families
but that an overstatement that fails to mention it an excise tax that would only affect workers with health care benefits above a certain level
under the senate finance proposal insurance companies would have to pay a percent excise tax on health insurance policies that exceed for individuals and for families
