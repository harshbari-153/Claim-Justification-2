Says restoring Georgia pre-k to a 180-day program was a "real result" of his leadership.
but he said restoring the program is a very good thing to have done
nathan deal was the driving force behind the push to reinstate the days to georgia
nathan deal is taking credit for restoring georgia s nationally lauded and program to its traditional days a year
those are important details that deal doesn t mention when he states that restoring to days was one of the real results of his term as governor
but can the governor take credit for being back on track this school year with a traditional calendar we decided a deeper look was needed
