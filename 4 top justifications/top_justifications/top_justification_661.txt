"If you take into account all the people who are struggling for work, or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent."
romney said if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking the real unemployment rate is over percent
so romney is right when he says that if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking the real unemployment rate is over percent
in other words for a general audience we think the real unemployment rate is acceptable shorthand for the labor underutilization rate especially when a brief description of the measure is provided
it true that bls describes it as a labor underutilization rate rather than an unemployment rate since some of the people it counts are workers who are officially unemployed
percent of the workforce either unemployed or it s worth noting that this statistic like the more commonly used unemployment rate is heading in a favorable direction
