Says in the 2012 State of the Union address, President Obama "didn't even mention the deficit or debt."
our ruling romney said that obama did even mention the deficit or the debt in his state of the union address
at least six different times in his state of the union address obama mentioned the debt or deficit by name
and if romney meant that obama made no mention of how to address the government s debt problems well yes he did
no mention of the deficit or the debt we decided to give the speech a read
mitt romney says president ignored debt problems in state of the union
