"John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time (last year)."
it not change when john mccain decided to stand with george bush percent of the time as he did in the senate last year obama said
mccain supported bush as infrequently as percent of the time in and backed the president position an average of percent of the time since
because obama correctly quotes an accurate measure of how often mccain was in sync with the president in we rule the claim truemccain percent score was the mark of his presidential support during president bush tenure and was partly a reflection of the new political calculus in the congress
john mccain is the equivalent of giving president bush a third term sen
