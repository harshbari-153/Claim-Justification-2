"ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil."
and now isis is making millions of dollars a week selling libyan oil trump said in the speech
trump said isis is making millions of dollars a week selling libyan oil
no donald trump isis is not millions of dollars a week selling libyan oil
at the moment they just appear interested in starving the libyan state of oil revenues
instead they say the terrorist group is focused on disrupting oil markets and preventing rivals from getting the oil in libya
