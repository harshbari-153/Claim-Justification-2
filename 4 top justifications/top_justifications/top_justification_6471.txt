we wondered if hasner cited his own efforts to weaken and school choice legislation as proof that he a moderate
our ruling lemieux says that hasner cited his efforts to weaken and school choice legislation as unequivocal proof that he s a moderate
he even cited his efforts to weaken and school choice legislation as unequivocal proof that he a moderate
did adam hasner call himself a moderate based on abortion and school choice votes
the piece gave kudos to hasner and called him an legislator but made no specific mention of his votes on abortion or school choice
