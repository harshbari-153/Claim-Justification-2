The U.S. initially had three federal felonies: treason, piracy, and counterfeiting securities and money.
it does mention three of them counterfeiting federal coins and securities piracy and felonies committed on the high seas and treason the ones that broun mentioned
it was treason piracy and counterfeiting securities and money broun said
initially we only had three federal felonies i believe
when america was in its infancy very few federal crimes existed
we read the act and found these additional crimes included committing murder in places under federal jurisdiction concealing federal crimes and aiding crime on the high seas
