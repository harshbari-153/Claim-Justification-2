In most states, you can buy an assault rifle with no proof of ID, but in every state, you need proof of ID to vote.
the viral image said that in most states you can buy an assault rifle with no proof of id but in every state you need proof of id to vote
in other words it s certainly possible to purchase a gun without an id in many states but in reality a large majority of purchases are done with ids and background checks
a misleading post on id requirements for buying guns voting
the graphic is more problematic on the point that in no state can you vote without proof of id
other states also have id requirements to vote but in many cases they allow paperwork including documents without a photograph in some cases
