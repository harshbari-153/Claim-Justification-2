"Texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law."
so texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law
davis said texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law
the association which favors strong state equal pay laws ranked texas among states with poor laws meaning in part that the laws don t apply to all workers
we recognized that texas has statutory restrictions on pay discrimination after asking davis about the basis of her declaration that texas ranks among states that don t have an equal pay law
texas might not have the strongest laws against pay discrimination
