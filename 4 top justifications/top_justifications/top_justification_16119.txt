In 2011 under Scott Walker, Wisconsin for the first time spent "more on our prison system than we did" on the University of Wisconsin System.
roys said that in under walker wisconsin for the first time spent more on our prison system than we did on the university of wisconsin system
i think in it was walker s first budget and we had the dubious distinction of spending for the first time in our state s history more on our prison system that we did on the entire uw system
that occurred with walker s first state budget for when he directed more state taxpayer dollars to the department of corrections than the uw system
as the milwaukee journal sentinel reported in that budget allotted for the first time more money for prisons and correctional facilities that is for the department of corrections than for the uw system
ahead of election gov scott walker attacked for spending more on corrections than colleges
