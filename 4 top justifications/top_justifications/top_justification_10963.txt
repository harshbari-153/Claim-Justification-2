Josh Mandel "is lying about his own record. The rating of Ohio's investment fund has NOT improved."
more importantly though the ad targets mandel s character questioning his truthfulness and makes the claim that he is lying about his own record

while the claims put the best possible spin on mandel performance they do not qualify as lying about his record
when we rated mandel s claim in his email half true for overstatement that was for his use of the words just received which we said could give the impression that the rating was new
