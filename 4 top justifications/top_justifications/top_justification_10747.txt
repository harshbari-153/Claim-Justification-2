"Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea. ... There are multiple news outlets that have reported" former President Barack Obama ordered wiretapping on Trump.
sanders said multiple news outlets have reported that obama ordered wiretaps on trump including sources such as the new york times and bbc
importantly these sources do not back up trump s accusation that obama himself ordered the wiretap as part of political sabotage
everybody acts like president trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there said deputy press secretary sarah huckabee sanders on march
and obama officials have also said a president can not unilaterally order a wiretap
president donald trump s white house offered dubious explanations on the sunday shows to defend trump s twitter accusation that former president barack obama wiretapped phones at trump tower before the election
