If you look at last year's presidential campaign, "you can't find a mention of public option."
we found a few mentions but the public option was not at all a significant point of debate during the presidential campaign
the public option was not discussed much during the campaign
but there was little discussion about the public option
we do recall any significant discussion of a public option nor did we do any items on it during the campaign
lieberman said it classic politics of our time that if you look at the campaign last year presidential you ca find a mention of public option
