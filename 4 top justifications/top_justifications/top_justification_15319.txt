"The majority of teams (are) now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football."
schlereth said the majority of teams are now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football
the rules are bent that way for the offense to have the advantage i think and that why you see the majority of teams now spending their dollars on the offensive side of the football
there s definitely evidence that nfl teams are spending more money on offensive players than defensive players
so are nfl teams predominantly spending their money building offenses as schlereth suggested
but while the broncos are considered the offensive team the seahawks actually spend a few extra million dollars on their offensive team
