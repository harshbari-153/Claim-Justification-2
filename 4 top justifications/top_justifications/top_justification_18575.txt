Says they said "it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit" and "we did it."
that it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time with an billion deficit
our ruling christie said naysayers said it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time with an billion deficit and we did it
and christie now dismisses that deficit calculation as the old way of budgeting
in a budget speech last year christie said the projected deficit assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities
and the next budget year the state still had a projected structural deficit
