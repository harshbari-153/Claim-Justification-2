Says former Sen. George Allen voted four times to raise his own pay.
tim kaine says george allen voted to raise his pay four times while in senate
our ruling kaine says allen voted four times to increase his pay in the senate
you voted four times to raise your own pay kaine said
so how does kaine back up his claim that allen voted four times to raise his salary not with votes to raise congressional salaries as kaine charged but with votes allen cast in the senate against measures that would have prevented the the automatic raises from going into effect
only three of the four votes kaine cited specifically focused on congressional pay raises
