You must list all your guns on your 2010 tax return.
now guns must be listed on your next tax return as if we didnt sic have enough to get upset about if you have a gun i hope it is registered senate bill will require us to put on our federal tax form all guns that you have or own
it will require fingerprints and a tax of per gun
the bill would have required people to register handguns in the national firearms registration and transfer record the government would have shared that information with law enforcement agencies and guns would have been taxed when they were manufactured or sold
list your guns on your no this bill never passed
it a scary time to be a gun owner in the united states at least if you believe some of the claims made by groups and spread in chain
