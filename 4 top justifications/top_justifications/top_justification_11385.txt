Joe Bidenâ€™s comments prove that food shortages are being "done deliberately by the governments of the world."
no biden s comments don t prove governments are orchestrating food shortages
a video being shared on facebook posits that governments around the world are orchestrating a food shortage and offers as evidence remarks president joe biden made in march
both talked about how we increase and disseminate food food shortages biden is captured saying in a clip included in the video
politico reporting on biden s meeting with other leaders noted that they pledged action to address food shortages caused by russia s war on ukraine
that quote is authentic but if you look at biden s remarks in context it s clear that he apparently misspoke and was actually talking about increasing and disseminating food around the world
