Says "90% of policemen are for" expanding background checks to all gun sales.
while speaking about legislation that would expand background checks to all gun sales durbin said of police back such a policy
to gain some insight into that position we asked local law enforcement leaders why police are likely to support expanding background checks
turns out that of policemen are for it of gun owners are for it the overwhelming majority of members of the national rifle association are for it
he was referencing a survey by pew research center which asked police at departments that employ or more officers whether they support requiring background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows
politifact has previously checked claims about broad support for expanded background checks among the general public along with statements that line up with what durbin said about gun owners and members of the national rifle association widely backing them as well
