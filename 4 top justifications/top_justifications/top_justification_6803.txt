President Barack Obama "has doubled the size of government since he took office."
makes a striking claim that president obama has doubled the size of goverment
paul ryan says barack obama doubled the size of government since he took office
at the same time the president has doubled the size of government since he took office
when ryan said that obama has doubled the size of government since he took office it sounds like he s saying obama has already doubled the size of government not that his spending blueprint will lead to doubled federal outlays at a point five years after obama s theoretical second term in office will have come to an end
our ruling even ryan s budget data offers no support for the notion that obama has doubled the size of government since he took office
