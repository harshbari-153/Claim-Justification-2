"I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and are seeking out the American dream."
and as i said in the last debate i spent years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and they seeking out the american dream
the other part of obama claim is that his experience is on behalf of families who are having a tough time and are seeking out the american dream
a the audacity of hope thoughts on reclaiming the american dream was published in
we wo count the business experience as working on behalf of families who are having a hard time but the community organizing work does seem to fit the bill
voters will decide whether the gap between years and years of experience is significant but we find obama statement about his own experience to be true
