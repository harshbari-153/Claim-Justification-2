Like me, Scott Walker opposed the 1998 transportation bill and the $9 billion of wasteful spending.
like me scott walker opposed the bill and the billion of wasteful spending
jim sensenbrenner says scott walker opposed the massive transportation bill
i voted against that bill because it was full of waste and payoffs to special interests
we rated that barely true walker publicly supported a provision of the measure relating to how some million in federal money for the area could be spent not the whole bill
sensenbrenner opposed it and says walker then a state lawmaker opposed it too
