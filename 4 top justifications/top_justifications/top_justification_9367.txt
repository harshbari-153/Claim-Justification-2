"McCain used to buck his party on immigration by fighting for comprehensive reform. . . . But when he was running for his party's nomination, he . . . said that he wouldn't even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote."
john mccain made that appeared to disavow an immigration plan mccain had championed in congress
mccain used to buck his party on immigration by fighting for comprehensive reform and i admired him for it obama said
however obama is laying it on thick in stating mccain bucked his party in crafting the original plan
asked during the debate whether he would vote for his original proposal if it came to the senate floor again mccain first demurred saying it would not return in that form
still because mccain essentially disavowed his original comprehensive immigration proposal and said repeatedly he would focus on border security as president we judge obama statement mostly true
