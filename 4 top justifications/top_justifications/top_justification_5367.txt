The Obama administration offered "$900 million to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to rebuild Gaza."
as you can see built into the question is a statement of fact that the obama administration offered million to hamas to rebuild gaza
republican national committee claims obama administration offered million to hamas to rebuild gaza
here we address the gop question do you support the obama administration s decision to offer million to hamas a recognized terrorist organization to rebuild gaza
still he said it a wild distortion to claim that the united states has offered hamas million
not only that but the claim that the money would be used to rebuild gaza after january violent conflict between israel and the islamic militant group hamas is also misleading
