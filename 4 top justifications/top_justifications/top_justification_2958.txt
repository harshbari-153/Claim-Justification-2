Says President Donald Trump "came forth with a budget â€” a trillion dollar cut in Medicaid, $500 billion to Medicare, and $72 billion for the Social Security Disability Fund."
and then he came forth with a budget a trillion dollar cut in medicaid billion to medicare and billion for the social security disability fund sanders said feb
there s no question trump s budget called for major reductions in medicaid and medicare spending from what would have been without changes in law or policy
sanders said trump proposed cuts of trillion to medicaid billion to medicare and billion to the social security disability fund
the white house trims the original budget line by billion but then proposes billion for a fund that would cover this for both medicare and medicaid which has a similar physician training provision
it is worth noting that president barack obama also proposed medicare cuts totalling billion over years
