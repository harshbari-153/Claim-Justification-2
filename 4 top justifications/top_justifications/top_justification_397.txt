another supporter of issue said there are other ways to handle a situation in which a commission member took a bribe
jon husted claims a member of the proposed redistricting commission could not be removed for taking a bribe
apparently you could accept a bribe from somebody to get the map that you want and you couldn t be removed from this commission husted a republican and outspoken critic of issue told reporters after the aug
so where does that leave us is husted s claim that a member who accepted a bribe could not be removed from the commission plausible no
so how would a commission member be removed for bribery we checked with husted s office for evidence to support his claim
