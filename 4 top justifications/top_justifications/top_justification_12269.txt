States "haven't even begun to spend the (election security) money they have now."
rubio said states have not even begun to spend the election security money they have now
there s debate over whether there s enough money in the pipeline to replace older voting machines and take other steps to harden state systems but here we focus on rubio s statement that states haven t begun to spend the money they have now
the only element of truth is that states have just begun to spend this new money and it is a small portion of what has been approved
marco rubio wrong on states not spending on voting security
additional states already might be spending funds but their plans lacked a clear schedule
