John McCain "has not led on nonproliferation issues when he had the chance in the Senate."
no speech by john mccain can change the fact that he has not led on nonproliferation issues when he had the chance in the senate burton said
the majority of people following the issue would point out mccain has not taken a leadership role on nonproliferation during his career in the senate said daryl kimball executive director of the arms control association
in spite of mccain moves to the center and his more positions on nonproliferation we do find much in mccain senate record to refute the charge of the obama camp
experts say the positions put mccain in a more centrist camp than bush on the question of how to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons
by embracing many aspects of barack obama nonproliferation agenda today john mccain highlighted obama leadership on nuclear weapons throughout this campaign and his bipartisan work with richard lugar in the senate
