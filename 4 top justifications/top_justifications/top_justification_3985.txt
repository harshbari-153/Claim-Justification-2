Says Donald Trump campaigned on not cutting Medicare and Social Security, but his nominee for the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, "made his career on cutting Medicare and Medicaid."
schumer said donald trump said when he campaigned he would cut medicare and social security but his nominee for the secretary of health and human services made his career on cutting medicare and medicaid
price the guy from hhs donald trump said when he campaigned he would cut medicare and social security but he turns around nominates as his hhs secretary guy who made his career on cutting medicare and medicaid schumer said on jan
throughout the course of the election trump largely promised to protect or save social security and medicare and instead to crack down on waste and fraud with a few detours
price trump s hhs pick has supported reducing the government s role in medicare and block granting medicaid which would amount to spending reductions to both programs
whether price s supported policies amount to cutting the health program or making it more is a matter of debate though he clearly wants to reduce the government s role in medicare
