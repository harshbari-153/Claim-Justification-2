"Obama's Ten Point Plan to 'Change' the Second Amendmentâ€¦Ban use of firearms for home defense."
that does sound to us like someone planning to ban use of firearms for home defense
the reverse listed the parts of the alleged plan starting with ban use of firearms for home defense
in any event there no fair way to interpret it as evidence that obama has a future plan to ban the use of firearms for home defense
in concrete terms obama was a vote against the state legislature tweaking a local gun ban
here what lapierre wrote about the vote when obama turned thumbs down on the bill he voted against the most basic element of the second amendment the right of defense of self and family the reason that millions of americans own firearms
