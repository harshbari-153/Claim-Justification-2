The Senate immigration bill "has immediate legalization ... and the border security is sometime in the future, and just like in 1986, it's designed never to come into being."
senate bill has immediate legalization but border security that never to come into being says cruz
and the border security is sometime in the future and just like in it designed never to come into being
cruz said the senate immigration bill offers immediate legalization of unauthorized immigrants and that it indefinitely defers action on border security
does legalization come before the border is secure and is border security treated as it was in the law and designed to never come to pass
the current bill both authorizes and actually appropriates spending for border security
