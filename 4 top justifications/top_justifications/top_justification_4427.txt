"Under Governor Crist, 3,000 teachers laid off."
a tv ad by scott s political committee says that under crist teachers were laid off
here we will if teachers were laid off under crist and if he was to blame
under governor crist teachers laid off says the narrator as text on the screen cites the center for economic and policy research
clearly some teachers were laid off statewide but the ad lacks evidence that it amounted to positions
but the miami herald reported that many teachers were moved into other jobs and a district spokesman told politifact florida that no teacher was laid off
