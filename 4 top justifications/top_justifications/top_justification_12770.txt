Sherrod Brown "has stood side by side" with President Barack Obama, presiding "over the most rapid increase in the debt over the last 2.5 years" and hurtling toward " the worst jobs record in the modern era."
however as senator brown has stood with president obama on virtually every major issue including all of his major spending proposals he and his fellow democrats in washington have presided over the most rapid increase in the debt over the last
so the components in order brown has stood side by side with president obama on virtually every major issue including all of his major spending proposals
it is correct in a narrow way when it says that brown and obama presided over the most rapid rise in debt in years but that claim ignores much greater rises in the rate of growth during the as well as the reason for some of the debt
brown and his fellow democrats have presided over the most rapid increase in the debt over the last
going back to each part of the claim then the nrsc is correct on the highlights when it says brown has stood side by side with obama on virtually every major issue
