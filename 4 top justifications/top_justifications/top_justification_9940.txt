NASA has discovered a new planet covered with marijuana
no nasa has not discovered a new planet covered in marijuana
let s be clear no nasa has not discovered a planet covered in marijuana
cannabis enthusiasts may have been lured to an online story that purports scientists have discovered a new planet completely covered in marijuana
the planet that was supposedly discovered planet even has its own hoax wikipedia page
the post attempts to make the claim appear slightly credible but falls short in several areas especially when quoting harvard astronomer david charbonneau as saying imagine if it takes years to travel from one planet to another let s just say it s going to be a very long trip
