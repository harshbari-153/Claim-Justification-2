If the sequester hits, "hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings."
our ruling obama said that if the sequester hits hundreds of thousands of americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings
hundreds of thousands of americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings obama said
barack obama says sequester would cut vaccinations cancer screenings for hundreds of thousands
but it important to note that obama language was imprecise enough to suggest that people may lose their access to primary care doctors outright which would be a much broader hit than cutbacks to flu shots and cancer screenings
there is no indication that americans will lose their insurance coverage or access to all primary care because of the sequester medicaid to cite just one example is spared from cuts entirely
