Says that "all those who do not answer directly to the president, they've said (repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell) is a terrible idea."
louie gohmert says those who do answer directly to president call repeal of ask do tell a terrible idea
and not all who don t answer directly to the president labeled the change a terrible idea
because we know what this president this commander in chief wants just as does the secretary of defense the two people that the president appoints said let do it because they know the president appointed he their boss and all those who do not answer directly to the president they said this is a terrible idea
james amos the marine corps top officer also recommended not repealing do ask do tell while the united states is at war
however three of the four joint chiefs the top officers gohmert refered to in his statement to us recommended not repealing the law now
