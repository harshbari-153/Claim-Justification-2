In contrast to President Barack Obama, who "is not acting presidential," President Ronald Reagan "would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on â€” that's how much he revered the presidency."
ronald reagan would never go into the oval office without his jacket on that how much he revered the presidency
so langone is incorrect when he says that reagan would never go into the oval office without his jacket on
so where does this leave us langone isn t correct that reagan would never go into the oval office without his jacket on since he did dress casually on weekend days
however langone used a vivid example that we think is checkable namely whether it s true that reagan would never go into the oval office without his jacket on
as we look into that question we ll compare reagan s sartorial habits in the oval office with obama s to see whether langone is justified in using obama s clothing choices to support his view that obama is not acting presidential
