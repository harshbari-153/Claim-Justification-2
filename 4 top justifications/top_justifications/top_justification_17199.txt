tom coburn the american people will be appalled to learn the health care bill exempts leadership and committee staff coburn told a group of reporters on march
health bill appears to exempt some congressional staff
since president barack obama signed the health care bill into law we seen many criticisms that some congressional staffers are exempt from buying health coverage through an insurance exchange
so that brings us back to coburn claim that committee and leadership staff are excluded from new rules in the health care bill
