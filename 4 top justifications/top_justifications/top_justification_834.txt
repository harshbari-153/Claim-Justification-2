Says Rihanna hired "five planes that carried 90,000 liters of water to support the fire control" in the Amazon rainforest.
one user published a screenshot of a tweet that claims the singer rihanna has hired five planes that carried liters of water to support the fire control in the amazon rainforest
over the past week tweeters have claimed that selena gomez rapper bhad bhabie nicki minaj and other public figures have also hired five planes to carry liters of water to the amazon
but when it comes to this rainforest claim we couldn t find any evidence to support the notion that she or any of the other celebrities mentioned on twitter had hired aircraft to help put out the amazon fires
finally we couldn t find any news stories mentioning rihanna even speaking about the amazon fires much less hiring planes to carry water there
we do know however that the brazilian military has used warplanes to dump water on the blazes
