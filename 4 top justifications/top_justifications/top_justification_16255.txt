Says Mitt Romney "paid only 14 percent in taxes â€” probably less than you."
we wondered whether it s accurate to say that romney paid only percent in taxes probably less than you
but chances are you pay a higher tax rate than him mitt romney made million in but paid only percent in taxes probably less than you
at the same time we should also note that romney s percent tax rate is quite a bit lower than the average tax rate for those in the top of percent of u
we should note one obstacle we don t know exactly how much romney paid in payroll taxes
still we can make an educated guess that perhaps percent to percent of taxpayers exceeded romney s tax rate for income taxes alone
