Says Chris Christie was the "first governor in America to endorse" Mitt Romney.
chris christie claims he was the first governor to endorse mitt romney
as part of his rebuttal christie repeated a line he said before he was the first governor to endorse romney
our ruling in light of a new york post article claiming christie doubted whether romney could beat obama christie claimed in a tv interview that he was the first governor in america to endorse romney
he was one of the first republican governors to back romney but not the first
but about four months before christie offered his endorsement the romney campaign announced he had the support of republican governors in nebraska and idaho and news articles noted both endorsements afterward
