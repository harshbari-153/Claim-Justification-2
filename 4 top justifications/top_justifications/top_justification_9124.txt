"We were promised (the stimulus) would provide 'green jobs' for Americans, but 80% of the $2 billion they spent on alternative energy went to purchase wind turbines built in China!"
among those broken promises is the administration pledge to provide jobs for americans but of the billion they spent on alternative energy went to purchase wind turbines built in china
back to what palin said that of the billion they spent on alternative energy went to purchase wind turbines built in china
so it incorrect to say that any stimulus money has gone to chinese turbine manufacturers let alone percent of the billion spent on renewable energy projects
their point wind energy projects supported with stimulus dollars create and save american jobs
palin claims that most of the renewable energy stimulus dollars have gone to chinese turbinemakers
