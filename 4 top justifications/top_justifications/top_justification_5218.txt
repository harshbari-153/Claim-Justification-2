"I don't think I've ever hired an illegal in my life."
in this case his wording is slightly different that he had not ever hired an illegal in my life
romney romney rick i do think i ever hired an illegal in my life
the two had this tense exchange perry mitt you lose all of your standing from my perspective because you hired illegals in your home and you knew about it for a year
he has made the argument he hired the company not the specific workers
when romney said he did not have illegal immigrants working for him we rated his statement mostly false given the credible evidence that undocumented lawn care laborers from guatemala worked at his home for years and his careful statements about his knowledge of their status
