"The auditor [for the city of Providence] was not locked out" of access to the city's finances.
our ruling former providence mayor david cicilline said that the internal auditor for the city was not locked out of access to the city finances
david cicilline says that when he was mayor of providence the city s internal auditor was not blocked from accessing financial records
the auditor now says that he was not locked out in the usual sense of the word
the auditor was not locked out in the strictest sense
but the inability of the internal auditor to get information that might have led to a timely disclosure of the city serious financial problems had the same effect
