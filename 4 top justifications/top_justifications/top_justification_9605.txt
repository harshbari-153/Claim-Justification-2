"People defying stay-at-home order fill Arizona beaches."
the image looked as though it was pulled from television news and under the headline crowded beaches in az was the summary people defying order fill arizona beaches
an april facebook post had a mock screenshot of beachgoers crammed cheek by jowl to enjoy the waves at arizona s ever popular seaside
meanwhile save your swimsuit for arizona s swimming holes and go after the crisis passes
wow this took me forever until i realized az doesn t have beaches does it said another
arizona does have its sandy deserts and it has plenty of places to swim
