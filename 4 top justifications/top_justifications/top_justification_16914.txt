Says Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed reduction in university spending is "about the size of the one" under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, but Democrats didn’t treat Doyle’s cut as so dire.
vos said walker s proposed reduction in university spending is about the size of the one that happened under doyle but democrats didn t treat that cut as so dire
it s worth pointing out though that doyle unlike walker allowed big tuition hikes to ease the budget cuts and that walker has proposed deeper cuts in the uw system than doyle in less time
robin vos says walker cut to uw budget is similar to doyle s but democrats didn t protest then
by contrast under walker his proposed reduction comes four years after cuts of million to universities in his first budget
doyle s cut was the first significant reduction in state support in years
