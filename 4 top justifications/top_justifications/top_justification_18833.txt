Chicago city officials "have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents."
attorney jeff sessions said chicago s leaders have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents
they have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement federal state and local and reduce crime and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents
accusing the chicago police department of maintaining an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents is a pretty serious charge from the nation s top law enforcement officer
but what about sessions allegation that chicago s official policy protects criminal aliens
chicago s welcoming city ordinance does prohibit chicago police officers from using citizenship information as the sole grounds for detaining people and sharply limits the interaction between city police and federal immigration agents
