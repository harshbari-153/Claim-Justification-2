perino claimed that a law passed by virginia democrats prevented local sheriffs from having military equipment that would have come in very helpful with recovery efforts in the traffic jam
the comment raised two questions did virginia democrats decide that local law enforcement shouldn t get access to certain types of military equipment and would the machinery have been helpful in recovery efforts on the snowy highway
virginia democrats voted to pass such a law but experts and state officials said that the prohibited equipment would not have helped clear roads any faster in the snowstorm and that the law did not hamper recovery efforts
traffic jam along interstate and that the types of equipment the law prohibits would not have been useful in clearing the snowy highway
even before that legislation became law the virginia state police had never purchased surplus military vehicles for use in interstate highway emergency response agency spokesperson corinne geller wrote in an email
