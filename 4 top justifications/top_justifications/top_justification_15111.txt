The National Technical Information Service spends millions of taxpayer dollars to print and sell government documents that are available free in online searches.
so is the government spending an estimated million a year of taxpayer money to make documents publicly available when a search engine does it for free we decided to check
david perdue said a small government office is spending taxpayer money to print and sell government reports that are available online for free
that number reflects a growing trend of government agencies posting their own scientific and technical reports to the web where anyone can search and print them out for free
but its own website encourages users to check with other government agencies and conduct an internet search before requesting documents
and google isn t charging money for many of the same documents that the ntis is charging taxpayers to catalog and print
