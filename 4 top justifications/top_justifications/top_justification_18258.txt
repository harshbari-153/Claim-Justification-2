Says U.S. Sen Sherrod Brown "promised that the first stimulus bill would fund the
Brent Spence Bridge."
sherrod brown promised that the first stimulus bill would fund the brent spence bridge and now he is embarrassed to stand there with the president after both of them broke their promise mandel s campaign said in a news release
so let s stipulate brown said in that the brent spence bridge was the kind of project the first stimulus could pay for using it as an example of a project
it is beyond question that brown cited the brent spence bridge in as an example of a project the first stimulus bill could fund just as obama used it as an example recently
he clearly suggested that the bridge could be built with stimulus money
josh mandel says sherrod brown promised ohio river bridge replacement as a stimulus project
