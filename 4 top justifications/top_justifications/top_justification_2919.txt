Says that the new financial services law requires 358 regulatory filings.
the new law does create a lot of new regulations for the financial services industry
the legislation requires regulators to issue at least new rules and conduct studies and reports that could lead to additional rules
the financial crisis occurred because there were gaps in the regulations
a july news release from the chamber goes even further citing a study that says the bill creates required regulatory rulemakings studies and reports
i think when it comes to the financial services bill and the regulatory filings required under that bill that it s going to require a significant amount of oversight so that not only will congress understand but the american people will understand just what this bill will do to our financial services industry boehner answered
