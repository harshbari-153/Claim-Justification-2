state law specifies that recapture receipts shall be deposited in the state treasury and may be used only for foundation school program purposes meaning the state s primary way of funding schools
collier said texas state government is set to take million more from taxpayers in certain school districts and not one penny of it will go to public education in texas
recapture is a method of finance for the appropriation for the foundation school program so increased recapture means the state needs to draw less money from other sources to total up to the amount of foundation school program state aid like state general revenue
