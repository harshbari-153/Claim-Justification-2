Four pharmaceutical companies have questionable track records that suggest their COVID-19 vaccines arenâ€™t safe.
an image on instagram takes aim at four pharmaceutical companies records to imply that their vaccines are unsafe
an instagram post makes statements about the records of four pharmaceutical companies to imply that the vaccines they make are unsafe
a post challenging vaccine safety takes drug makers records out of context
the individual statements accurately reflect the companies track records though in some cases they don t relate to the companies vaccines
in presenting these statements as a basis for judging the safety of their vaccines the post leaves out important context about the companies broader safety record and research studies and experience that have shown the vaccines to be safe and effective
