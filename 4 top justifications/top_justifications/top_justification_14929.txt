Says Joe Biden has "allowed males to compete in girlsâ€™ sports."
a facebook post says biden has allowed males to compete in girls sports
the claim that biden allowed males to compete in girls sports likely stems from an executive order from the biden administration titled preventing and combating discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation
biden administration did not dictate specific changes to sports
the claim seems to be based on an executive order biden issued that prohibits discrimination based on gender and sexuality in education but that opponents say will allow transgender females to compete in women s sports
