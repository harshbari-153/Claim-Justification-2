"Every time they’ve done those border patrols, they’ve taken out people who have trafficked drugs. That’s the federal government’s role. They’re doing their job."
every time they ve done those border patrols they ve taken out people who have trafficked drugs sununu said on june
as to the first part of sununu s statement that border patrol agents have taken out people who have trafficked drugs every time they ve held a checkpoint that s not the case if he s referring to arrests
and sununu is correct that the federal government has used the checkpoints in the recent past to facilitate drug arrests according to customs and border patrol and widespread media coverage of the stops
and sununu s comment about the federal government role raises a larger question about the purpose of the checkpoints are they to catch illegal immigrants or drug offenders
still regardless of which agency brought out the handcuffs sununu s comment raises a more basic question do drug arrests conducted at checkpoints fall under the federal government s role specifically customs and border protection s role
