The pipe bomb suspectâ€™s van was staged.
no the pipe bomb suspect van was not staged
this is the van
other media outlets including the washington post and the miami herald have also reported on the van posting photos of the vehicle and talking to floridians who recall seeing the van before the pipe bombs were mailed
looks way too staged wrote one person who posted a picture of a white van to facebook on oct
the van isn t fake but the suggestion that it s a plant to support false flag theories is wrong
