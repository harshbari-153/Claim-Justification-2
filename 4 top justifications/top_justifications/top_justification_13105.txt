"Cancer institute finally admits marijuana kills cancer."
cancer institute finally admits marijuana kills cancer trumpets the headline of an article that has been shared about times on facebook
the article goes on to say that in august the national cancer institute released a report on its website that stated marijuana kills cancer
but nowhere on the site does it say marijuana kills cancer
so while cannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in labs and it may benefit the side effects of cancer treatments like chemotherapies it s not an cancer treatment there isn t enough evidence for doctors to recommend it as a treatment for symptoms and the national cancer institute has not admitted that marijuana kills cancer
no the national cancer institute has not named marijuana a cancer cure
