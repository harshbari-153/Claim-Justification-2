italy has decided not to treat their elderly for this virus
a facebook post claiming italy had decided to stop treating elderly patients goes too far

but that doesn t mean the country decided to stop treating elderly coronavirus patients
italy s overwhelmed hospitals are treating elderly patients as a lower priority
