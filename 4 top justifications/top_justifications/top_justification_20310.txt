"We now have a pro-American president in France, which shows if you live long enough, anything can happen in this world."
which shows if you live long enough anything can happen in this world
but french presidents have long been in the most important sense maintaining their alliance with the united states
and by the way in case you missed it we now have a president in france mccain said july
that follows in a long tradition of french presidents who while maintaining a close alliance with the united states have resisted certain aspects of our foreign policy to varying degrees
so yes a strain of runs through french foreign policy and culture flaring up at times and mellowing out at others
