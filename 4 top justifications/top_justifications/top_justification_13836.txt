"Kim Martin Morrow the CEO of Netflix has just been charged with 15 charges for child pornography"
social media posts claim kim martin morrow the ceo of netflix has just been charged with charges for child pornography
kim martin morrow the ceo of netflix has just been charged with charges for child pornography and files have been found on his personal computers for child porn from ages and as young as toddlers reads the text of a post that has been copied numerous times on different social media platforms
no netflix s ceo wasn t charged with counts of child pornography
so why are social media users falsely linking a fake netflix ceo to child pornography charges that s a bit complicated
but airing a controversial film is not a crime and netflix s ceo hasn t been charged with any as the post claims
