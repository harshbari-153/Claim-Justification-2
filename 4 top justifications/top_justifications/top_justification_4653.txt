"Florida ranks 45th" in the nation for tuition.
using the most comprehensive survey of postsecondary education available florida does indeed rank if you count the district of columbia otherwise the state ranks

in that scenario florida ranks dead last for tuition costs
allowing tuition increases helps keeps florida nationally competitive
