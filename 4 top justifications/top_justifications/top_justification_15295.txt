Says states not directly involved in the gay marriage lawsuits that reached the Supreme Court "are not bound" by the courtâ€™s ruling.
cruz said states not directly involved in the gay marriage lawsuits that reached the supreme court are not bound by the court s ruling
separately several legal experts told us the idea that states not party to the marriage cases weren t bound by the court s ruling may have technical merit but that s all
ted cruz states not singled out by supreme court not bound by gay marriage ruling
technically the only parties that are bound by a ruling by the supreme court are the parties to that litigation and so in the context of the marriage cases the small subset of states whose bans on gay marriage were before the court
but that s an incomplete answer to the question of whether states could ignore the court s ruling
