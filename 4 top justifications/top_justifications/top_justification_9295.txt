"Since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns."
clinton said since we last debated in las vegas nearly people have been killed by guns
just think about this since we last debated in las vegas nearly people have been killed by guns she said
so clinton is wrong to suggest we can know how many people died from gun injuries since the democrats debated in las vegas
really were people were killed by guns in just one month we decided to check it out
experts say the number of gun deaths this year is likely to be similar to or higher than so clinton s claim is probably not too far off
