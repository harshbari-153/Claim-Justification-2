"When [Mitt Romney] was the governor of Massachusetts, he performed 100 — and I’m not sure this number is right, but my mind says it’s about 180 gay marriages."
when he was the governor of massachusetts he performed and i m not sure this number is right but my mind says it s about gay marriages and now when he is running as president on the republican ticket he says that marriage is between a man and a woman manning said in the article
manning used the wrong language to describe romney s actions as governor because her estimate of how many marriages she thought he performed is very similar to the number of marriage designations that the boston globe reported
did romney actually perform to gay marriages didn t romney say in a nationally televised debate earlier this month that while he believes gay couples should have basic legal rights one right they should not enjoy is marriage we were curious to find out if manning was right particularly since she wasn t sure about how many marriages romney may have performed
a romney spokesman said in that article that he was bound by the law and had to approve those marriage designations although he opposed gay marriage
the article was a look into romney s approach on gay marriage as he considered a presidential run which he later lost in the gop primary
