Says unlike Tim Kaine, who "invested"Â in education, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence "slashed education funding."
clinton said that unlike tim kaine who invested in education in virginia mike pence slashed education funding in indiana
while mike pence slashed education funding in indiana and gave more tax cuts to the wealthiest tim kaine cut his own salary and invested in education from through college and beyond she said
we found that clinton s claim that kaine invested in education while pence slashed education funding is an exaggeration at best
indiana has not slashed education funding under pence s leadership
the clear implication from clinton s statement is that pence cut education in indiana while kaine grew it in virginia
