A video shows Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy singing "Imagine" by John Lennon.
a viral youtube video watched more than million times is falsely labeled as showing ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy singing a cover of john lennon s imagine
does video show zelenskyy singing imagine by john lennon no it s a florida band s lead singer
the miscaptioned radio salento video went viral weeks after another video of manzano and singer connie talbot was shared online by social media users who falsely claimed it showed zelenskyy and his wife singing endless love a song by lionel richie and diana ross
such claims are fueled by zelenskyy s previous career as an actor writer and comedian before he entered politics and was elected president of ukraine in
the video however does not show zelenskyy
