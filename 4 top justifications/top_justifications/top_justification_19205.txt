the trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in the state of new york because they stole from a kids cancer charity
a facebook post said the trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in the state of new york because they stole from a kids cancer charity
trump family disallowed from operating charities in new york no
as a result the lawsuit sought to dissolve the foundation and to temporarily prohibit the trumps from future service in new york or charitable organizations
the settlement however does not ban the trump family from operating a charity in new york as this original facebook post claimed
