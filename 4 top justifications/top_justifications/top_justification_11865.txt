The tax penalty that the government imposes if you don't buy health insurance "is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance."
our ruling desantis said that the tax penalty in the health reform law is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance
the point congressman desantis was making is that under obamacare the penalty intended to force you to buy health insurance is less expensive than the average annual premium
the tax that they put on you to buy insurance is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance so i think a lot of people are going to pay the tax and that going to destabilize the insurance market
they agreed that the tax is less than the cost of insurance
that s also the purpose of the tax penalty to urge people to get insurance
