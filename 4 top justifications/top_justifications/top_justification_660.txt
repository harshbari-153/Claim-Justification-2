"Sen. Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue."
obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue mccain said
mccain speaks in absolutes obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue but the record supports him
and this was an issue where obama was particularly outspoken so it can hardly be argued that he had taken on his party leaders on tort reform
obama no maverick
none of the examples the obama campaign provides could be seen as major issues on which obama was at odds with his party leadership
