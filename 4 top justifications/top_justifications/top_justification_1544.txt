"We were living outside of Houston and thatâ€™s when I found it: a commuter college, 45 minutes away that cost $50 a semester."
a commuter college minutes away that cost a semester
the university of houston was about forty minutes away and tuition was only a semester she wrote
but then a friend told me about the university of houston a public college about minutes away
warren describes the university as a commuter college implying that she lived at home and traveled back and forth to campus to attend her classes which would negate costs associated with room and board
today tuition at the university of houston costs about per semester for an undergraduate student taking hours
