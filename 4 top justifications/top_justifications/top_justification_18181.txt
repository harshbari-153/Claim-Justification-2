"Water transportation is the most fuel efficient, least polluting, safest, and least expensive means of moving cargo."
water transportation is the most fuel efficient least polluting safest and least expensive means of moving cargo he said
gibbs said that water transportation is the cheapest safest cleanest and most fuel efficient way to move cargo
he also said water transportation was the cleanest and safest way to move cargo
so it appears that gibbs was correct when he said water transportation is the most fuel efficient way to move cargo as well as the least expensive
but that said the experts we talked to were persuasive that on average water transportation is least expensive
