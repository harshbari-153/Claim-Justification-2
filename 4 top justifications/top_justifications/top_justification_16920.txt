"We’re the seventh highest taxed state in America. And that’s not just state, it’s local as well."
we re the seventh highest taxed state in america
so where does that leave kasich s claim kasich said ohio had the seventh highest state and local tax burden in the country relying on a study of the tax foundation study
however that figure was for and the study has been updated with the most recent set of rankings showing the state to have the highest state and local tax burden
during his successful run for governor against democrat ted strickland in kasich claimed that ohio was one of the most heavily taxed states in a television ad that got major airplay around labor day
but the governor s now getting more specific about how he defines taxed by placing it in the context of ohio s combined local and state tax burdens
