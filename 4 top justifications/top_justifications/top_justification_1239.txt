"Portland goon squads were Blackwater contractors not federal officers."
word on the street portland goon squads were blackwater contractors not federal officers wrote one facebook user on july
but we could find no statements from public officials public documents or news reports about the government using contractors in lieu of federal agents to quell protests in portland
but how do we know they re federal officers and does blackwater have anything to do with what is unfolding in portland politifact took a look
however public officials have made no public statements about using defense contractors in lieu of federal agents to quell protests in portland
there may well be contractors defending federal buildings in the city but the facebook post said they are standing in for federal officers
