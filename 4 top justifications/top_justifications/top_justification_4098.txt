The Great Recession emerged "in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm."
clinton said the great recession emerged in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy failed to invest in the middle class took their eyes off of wall street and created a perfect storm
that was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy failed to invest in the middle class took their eyes off of wall street and created a perfect storm
it s not the tax cuts for the rich per se but their effect of concentrating income at the very top that was the major cause of the great depression and in turn the great recession mcelvaine said
but an ideological of economists agreed that the recession was primarily caused by a housing bubble that turned into a financial crisis and that it was caused by many factors more significant than low taxes
so for clinton to say that tax cuts for the rich in large part caused the great recession is a significant exaggeration
