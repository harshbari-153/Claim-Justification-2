Says "a rioter accidentally dropped" a riot manual with detailed instructions.
a recent facebook post showed the warped image of a page from a riot manual giving instructions for organized violence and claimed a rioter accidentally dropped this oops
to sum up this riot manual was created in and doesn t apply to the protests happening in
the manual refers to protests in baltimore in april over freddie gray s death
some of the protests in baltimore did become violent but the one this document talks about escalating into a riot was not
the manual appears to have been created to falsely blame a democrat super pac friends of democracy for violent protesting in
