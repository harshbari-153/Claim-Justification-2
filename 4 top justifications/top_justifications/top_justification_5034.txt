"Black Lives Matter is a terrorist organization."
black lives matter is a terrorist organization
a widely shared facebook post claimed black lives matter is a terrorist organization
but black lives matter does not fit the federal definition of a terrorist organization nor does it appear as a terrorist group in an extensive database that tracks terrorism attacks globally
black lives matter is not a terrorist organization nor a terrorist movement and no responsible source would describe it as such david sterman an international security senior policy analyst at the new america think tank told politifact
earlier in july a city councilor in massachusetts made the same attack and rudy giuliani president donald trump s personal lawyer said black lives matter will be shown to be a terrorist organization
