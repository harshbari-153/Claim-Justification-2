Says he did not say Republicans would filibuster immigration reform.
kyl staff told us he only meant that republicans would filibuster a purely partisan bill not the kind of bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform that kyl put forward with sen
the answer indicates kyl is not optimistic about immigration reform but we wanted to find out whether kyl said republicans would filibuster or not
my guess is neither card check and immigration reform will have the votes to pass
are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform i do think i said that jake but what i did say is that the conditions for immigration reform no longer exist kyl said
are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform remains an fair summary though not a quotation of kyl town hall remarks
