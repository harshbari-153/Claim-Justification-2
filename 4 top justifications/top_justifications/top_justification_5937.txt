"Doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines all found murdered."
com posted a story headlined doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines found murdered on march
while the article says these doctors died in connection with promoting theories about vaccines only bradstreet s case even comes close
but we found little evidence that the deaths of doctors are were connected to the vaccine controversy
the article puts forward a conspiracy theory that is based on the actual deaths of american doctors but there is no information that they worked together on vaccine discoveries nor were their deaths connected
a fake news story tried to connect the random deaths of doctors with conspiracy theories around vaccination
