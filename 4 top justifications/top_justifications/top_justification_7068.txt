"The use of ballot drop boxes and ballot harvesting is illegal."
nicholson claimed the use of ballot drop boxes and ballot harvesting is illegal
the use of ballot drop boxes and ballot harvesting is illegal and all of these questions should have been settled years ago
so is he right about the use of drop boxes and ballot harvesting being illegal
what s more there is nothing illegal about using the drop boxes in the upcoming primary
drop boxes and what has been termed ballot harvesting are different things but have become tangled together in the debate
