"I made a bunch of these promises during the campaign. ... We've got about 60 percent done in three years."
our ruling obama s statement at the fundraiser was clearly in the past tense about having already done percent of his promises in three years and a white house spokeswoman made it clear he was relying on numbers from our obameter
that said here s the current breakdown of promises on the obameter promise kept or percent compromise or percent in the works or percent stalled or percent promise broken or percent not yet rated or
but to reach percent the white house needs to include a lot of promises rated in the works in its count of what been done
so we ve got about percent done in three years but applause so i m pretty confident we can get the other percent done in the next five years
we rate promises in the works if the administration or its allies in congress have taken steps to implement the promise but haven t done enough to move it to either promise kept or promise broken
