"The American people spoke pretty loudly. They said stop all the looming tax hikes...."
john boehner says the american people spoke pretty loudly they said stop all the looming tax hikes
the polls show that while many americans oppose an expiration of the bush tax cuts it is not accurate to say the public spoke pretty loudly that congress should stop all the looming tax hikes
but boehner said americans want to stop all the looming tax hikes and the polls do support such a sweeping claim
they said stop all the looming tax hikes and to cut spending
i do know what my colleagues across the aisle did hear during the election the american people spoke pretty loudly boehner said
