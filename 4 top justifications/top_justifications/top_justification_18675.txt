o connor said percent of federal inmates are noncitizens
conservative host noncitizens are of federal inmates
in the middle of this verbal melee carlson interjected with let me take control of this o connor said percent of federal inmates are noncitizens
if you take those people out of the equation you re looking at about percent of federal inmates
if you want to know how many noncitizens are in prison for breaking a law that all citizens must obey like not committing murder as in san francisco then you d probably prefer the lower number from the bureau of justice statistics
