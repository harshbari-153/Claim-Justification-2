"Due to the new ‘delta variant’ California will be mailing in ballots for recall election."
due to the new delta variant california will be mailing in ballots for recall election reads the text of a screenshot of a tweet being shared on instagram
some social media users are claiming that california exploited the delta variant as an excuse to use ballots for the upcoming recall election in which voters will decide whether to oust democratic gov
ballots approved in california before delta surge
but the ballot decision predates the current surge that s being driven by the contagious delta variant
but to claim that lawmakers are seizing upon the delta variant to extend universal voting for the recall election is wrong
