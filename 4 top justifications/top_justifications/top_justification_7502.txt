A ban on earmarks greatly weakens the authority Congress has over spending, to the benefit of the executive branch.
dave obey says an earmarks ban would greatly weaken congressional authority ceding it to the executive branch
inhofe argued on the senate floor that earmarks is such a loose term that virtually all congressional appropriation authority could be compromised by a ban
obey and others overreach by suggesting congress would be bereft of spending oversight under an earmarks moratorium
congress should restrict earmarks to eliminate pointless spending but without limiting its powers to make specific appropriations where appropriate harrison said
as they note congressional authority has slipped and a blanket approach to banning earmarks could further tip the scales to the administration
