"Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt."
i mean andrew jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget where we had no national debt
carson said andrew jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget where we had no national debt
jackson was the last and only president to bring the national debt to zero on top of having a balanced budget
while the only president to see a national debt of zero jackson certainly wasn t the only president who presided over a balanced budget
jackson was in fact the only president to preside over a total elimination of all remaining debt while having a balanced budget
