Eliminating the state tax on health savings accounts will "make it easier for small business owners to provide health insurance to their employees."
scott walker says that eliminating state tax on health savings accounts would increase the number of small businesses offering health insurance
walker included a pledge to eliminate the tax as one of his campaign promises declaring on his website that the change would make it easier for small business owners to provide health insurance to their employees
but walker is arguing that a tax break for individuals not employers would boost the number of small businesses that provide health insurance
many businesses have embraced plans which typically mean lower premiums than on conventional insurance plans
health savings accounts are allowed with plans that have deductibles of at least for individual and for family coverage
