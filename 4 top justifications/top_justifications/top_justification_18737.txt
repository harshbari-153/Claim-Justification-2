"Could I just point out that ... I seem to get the first question all the time?"
well could i just point out that in the last several debates i seem to get the first question all the time and i do mind clinton said during a feb
barack obama that she often has to answer the first question in televised debates
if there was an advantage or disadvantage to receiving the first question it quickly was counteracted by the many questions that evened things out
she has received the first question in five of the six debates this year
my impression of what was happening here is hillary was actually trying to say i always get all of the hard questions and it just came out as how come i always getting the first question he said
