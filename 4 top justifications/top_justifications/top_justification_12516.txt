"Lyme disease is one of the fastest growing infectious diseases in the United States, and Rhode Island has the second-highest incidence of this disease in the country."
what caught our eye was the assertions in her news release that lyme disease is one of the fastest growing infectious diseases in the united states and rhode island has the incidence of this disease in the country
in the end cdc data confirm that even though sosnowski was citing outdated information it still fair to say that lyme is one of the nation s fastest growing infections
the second question is whether rhode island really ranks second in incidence of lyme cases nationwide
in the cdc numbers showed a dozen states had a higher rate of confirmed cases of lyme than rhode island
sosnowski says rhode island ranks second in for lyme disease
