"The total number of dollars that passes through the Department of Development is like $900 million and like $650 (million) of it has nothing to do with development, which is breathtaking when you think about it."
the total number of dollars that passes through the department of development is like million and like million of it has nothing to do with development which is breathtaking when you think about it kasich told reporters aug
but the department can not say how much of that million can be extrapolated as purely job creation spending
that would mean the department spends about percent of its funds for job creation
of that the agency is spending million this year not including federal matching funds directly on what it calls economic development which is job development programs
the agency s fiscal year budget is a little over million
