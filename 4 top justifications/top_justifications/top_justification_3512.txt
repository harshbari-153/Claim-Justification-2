When White House communications director Anita Dunn said that Mao Tse-tung was "one of her favorite philosophers, only Fox News picked that up."
in a recent segment with conservative commentator ann coulter fox news channel host bill slammed other media outlets for failing to cover a story unearthed by fox that a senior aide to barack obama had told high school students that one of her favorite political philosophers was mao the late chinese communist leader who is blamed for the deaths of millions of people
two syndicated columnists based at the washington post wrote about dunn mao comment
dunn then told an anecdote about how mao triumphed as an underdog over his rival nationalist leader chiang during the chinese civil war
meanwhile lou dobbs on his nightly news show on cnn gave a brief hat tip to beck story adding that mao may have been responsible for as many as million deaths before proceeding into a plug for his syndicated radio show where viewers could hear more of my thoughts on all the president czars and their fascination with mao
the day after beck aired the video cnn suzanne malveaux and ed hornick posted a web story in which dunn said that the mao quote is one i picked up from the late republican strategist lee atwater from something i read in the late so i hope i do get my progressive friends mad at me
