President Joe Bidenâ€™s day one approach to immigration included "blanket amnesty and halting border wall construction."
while biden s executive actions call for a pause of border wall construction with a goal of ending it none of his immigration related actions call for blanket amnesty
we re going to focus on whether or not biden s presidential actions include plans to halt border wall construction and give blanket amnesty
president biden s day one approach to immigration is it will make our country less safe and disadvantage us economically
joe biden border wall criticism hits mark but blanket amnesty misses
there s no doubt our immigration system is broken but blanket amnesty and halting border wall construction will take us in the wrong direction
