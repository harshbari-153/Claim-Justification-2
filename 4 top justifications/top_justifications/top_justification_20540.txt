Preventive care "saves money."
obama says preventive care saves money it does
studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs
so the consensus is that while preventive care will almost certainly save lives it wo reduce government spending on health care
article in the new england journal of medicine that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care
preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem however such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it
