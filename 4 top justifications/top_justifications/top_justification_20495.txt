Says "over 40 Republican leaders denounced" Steve Watkinsâ€™ campaign
the dccc said that over republican leaders denounced the watkins campaign
thus a claim in a new dccc ad which says that over republican leaders denounced watkins campaign
yes republican leaders collectively announced concerns about watkins in late july as did some others individually
and so on july a group of grassroots leaders in the district issued a news release expressing concerns about watkins
so what about those republican denouncements cited in the dccc ad
