Marriage "decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent."
rubio said that marriage decreases the probability of child poverty by percent
he also said that being a family decreases the probability of child poverty which sounds to us like a mathematical analysis of the existing data rather than a suggestion that changing policies to encourage marriage will actually reduce poverty that already exists
a reader asked us to investigate whether rubio is correct that marriage decreases the probability of child poverty by percent
being raised in a married family reduced a child s probability of living in poverty by about percent
that s a percent decrease in the likelihood of poverty rather than percent
