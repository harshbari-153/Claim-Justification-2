Alex Sink "used a taxpayer-funded plane so she could get to a vacation in the Bahamas."
gop says alex sink used a airplane to to a vacation in the bahamas
the nrcc said in its ad that sink used a plane so she could get to a vacation in the bahamas
even if the flight took her only miles it still can be construed as sink s using the plane to get to a vacation in the bahamas
the state airplane episode was a big deal for sink during her campaign and the claim that she used the plane to get to the bahamas was designed to cause her turbulence again
