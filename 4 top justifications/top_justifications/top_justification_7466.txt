Under Gov. Bob McDonnell, more jobs have been lost than created in Southside and Southwest Virginia.
armstrong says jobs are down in southside and southwest under gov mcdonnell

so we started digging for data that would better establish the employment trend in southside and southwestern virginia during the mcdonnell administration
