Says that when he was governor of Utah, he worked with the state Legislature to create a flat tax that "cut income taxes by 30 percent."
in fact utah s system of tax credits make the tax somewhat progressive in practice which is something a true flat tax would not be
so we wondered if huntsman and the utah legislature had succeeded in overhauling the state law to the point where it can be considered a flat tax and whether they cut income taxes by percent
this makes the effective tax rate about percent for utah taxpayers earning a year in and percent for a household with in taxable income according to the legislative group analysis
rather utah s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits said a january report of the utah office of legislative research and general counsel
the research arm of the utah legislature maintains it was not a flat tax in the purest sense
