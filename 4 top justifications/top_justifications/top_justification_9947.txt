"There are currently delays of up to six months in the processing of DNA evidence at the state run crime lab."
there are currently delays of up to six months in the processing of dna evidence at the state run crime lab dewine states on his campaign website
on average we are waiting a long time sometimes even over a year for dna evidence and during that time the case is just sitting there phillips said
therefore we rate dewine statement that dna evidence is currently taking up to six months to be processed by the bci crime lab to be half true
the third example from a report may focused on a lengthy delay in dna evidence processing in the murder of grace kennedy in bryan ohio
even cordray own statistics show that processing of dna evidence stretches beyond six months in about percent of cases including at least three cases not shipped to an outside lab
