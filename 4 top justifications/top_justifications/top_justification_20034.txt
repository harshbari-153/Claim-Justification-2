"Less mass shootings under Trump!"
in the wake of two mass shootings that left dead in the span of hours tusler claimed there have been fewer such shootings under trump than obama
less mass shootings under trump his base does hate anyone declared tusler in a post
so shootings are up not down under trump
the text accompanied a of a chart shared by another person that showed mass shootings under president barack obama and four shootings under trump
and it s absurd to use a raw tally of shootings to compare just over two years under trump to eight years under obama
