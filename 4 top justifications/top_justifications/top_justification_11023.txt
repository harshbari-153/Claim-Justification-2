"The actions Iâ€™m taking" are "the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half-century."
obama said the actions i m taking are the kinds of actions taken by every single republican president and every single democratic president for the past
the actions i m taking are not only lawful they re the kinds of actions taken by every single republican president and every single democratic president for the past half century obama said
in other words it s an exaggeration to say that obama s actions are the kinds of actions taken by every single president of the past half century
he has a point that every president since eisenhower republican and democratic alike has taken executive action on immigration
eisenhower a republican took at least one such action
