Says itâ€™s a "statistical reality that most single moms are very poor, under-educated, can't get a job, and if it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death."
my comments were about the statistical reality that most single moms are very poor ca get a job and if it were for government assistance their kids would be starving to death
most single moms are very poor
and one claim is wrong that single moms aren t able to get jobs
single mothers are a highly disadvantaged group in many ways said arloc sherman a senior researcher with the liberal center on budget and policy priorities
that compares to percent of all single moms officially below the poverty level and an additional percent at less than twice the poverty level
