The Tony Evers administration is wrong to blame old computer software being used to process unemployment claims; it "has nothing to do with" the backlog.
kapenga claimed the evers administration is wrong to blame old computer software being used to process unemployment claims declaring it has nothing to do with the backlog
is he right that the evers administration is wrongly blaming the software system
did software cause wisconsin unemployment backlogs not quite but it did delay payments
the system can t do its job if it isn t told what to do
so far the state department of workforce development which oversees the payments has blamed the problem largely on a software program that powers the system
