"We will be over 290 electoral votes on Election Night ... no matter what they (Democrats) try to do, what kind of hijinks or lawsuits or whatever kind of nonsense they try to pull off."
we believe that we will be over electoral votes on election night
so no matter what they try to do what kind of hijinks or lawsuits or whatever kind of nonsense they try to pull off we still going to have enough electoral votes to get president trump reelected
miller said we will be over electoral votes on election night
if you speak with many smart democrats they believe that president trump will be ahead on election night probably getting electoral votes somewhere in that range and then they going try to steal it back after the election miller said
no candidate will be over electoral votes on election night because electoral votes aren t cast until dec
