Voter turnout for some groups in the 2008 presidential general election in Georgia "was far greater than it should have been demographically."
we wondered was voter turnout higher among some historically disadvantaged groups during georgia s election cycle and if so is there some context to consider this is not the first time someone has used georgia as a case study on voter id laws and their impact or lack thereof on the presidential election
it s correct that black voter turnout in georgia did increase between the and presidential elections but the increase wasn t as kampf said far greater
and they had it in and in those communities which often are said to have been impacted by voter id laws the turnout was actually far greater than it should have been demographically kampf a republican said
university of georgia political science professor charles bullock said obama s presence on the ballot undoubtedly was a factor in turnout among black voters
the legislator in question here seems to think that because there was a spike in turnout in there are no barriers to turnout for any blacks gillespie said via email
