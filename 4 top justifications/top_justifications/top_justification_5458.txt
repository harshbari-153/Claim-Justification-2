"We are currently using only around 20% of our testing capacity."
the actual number of tests conducted was about about of the testing capacity
now we re able to test more we need to get the message out that people should be testing more
she said about half of the state s testing capacity up around as of april could be used today though the collection supplies available now wouldn t necessarily sustain that volume indefinitely
the massive lab accounts for about half of the state testing capacity number but they are at least several weeks from being able to actually obtain that many tests to process
and the testing capacity number is skewed by the inclusion of exact sciences a lab that has just started doing coronavirus testing
