Says the state's Medicaid waiver proposal "has languished in a file cabinet at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for more than two years."
gov rick perry says state medicaid proposal has languished in federal file cabinet for years
perry went on unfortunately this waiver which presents a strategic alternative to continued reliance on health care programs has languished in a file cabinet at the centers for medicare and medicaid services for more than two years
as an example he pointed to a proposal that texas submitted to the federal government with the goal of reducing the number of uninsured residents by restructuring federal medicaid funding
perry description of the waiver proposal status rang a bell here at politifact texas
in the spring we rated as false a statement perry made in an april interview with the texas tribune and newsweek magazine that texas has been waiting for more than two years for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to create insurance opportunities for those that are uninsured today
