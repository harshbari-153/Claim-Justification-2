In 2006, Arizona had four ballot issues that were "very tough on illegal immigration... Forty-seven percent of the Hispanics in Arizona voted for them."
in arizona in the last election what we saw was a really amazing thing that they had four issues on the ballot in arizona all of them were very tough on illegal immigration one was an english only i think amendment of some sort
there were four issues percent of the hispanics in arizona voted for them
but as far as the three other immigration measures on the arizona ballot that fall we do know how hispanics voted
in the election there were four issues on the ballot related to immigration
politifact found that percent of hispanic voters in arizona supported proposition which requires all formal state government action to be in english with some exemptions
