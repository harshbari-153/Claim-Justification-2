Says Congressman Jon Runyan does not want to cut taxes for the middle class, but only for millionaires.
in response to our findings dccc spokesman josh schwerin said in an if congressman runyan wanted to give the middle class a tax cut he wouldn t be holding it hostage in order to get more tax cuts for millionaires
our ruling in an online ad campaign the dccc suggests runyan and other house republicans support a bill that cuts taxes for millionaires but not the middle class
the ad targeting runyan ends with this message tell congressman jon runyan stop putting millionaires over the middle class
still it s wrong for the dccc to suggest the gop only wants to cut taxes for millionaires
but unlike the democrats plan the house republicans bill would not extend five other tax policies benefiting households which are separate from the bush tax cuts
