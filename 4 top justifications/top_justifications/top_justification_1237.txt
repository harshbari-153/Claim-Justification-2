In her defeat of Republican Rep. Karen Handel, Democratic challenger Lucy McBath "was outspent 5-1."
one of these was georgia s district where democratic challenger lucy mcbath defeated republican incumbent karen handel
tweeted that mcbath was outspent in her race against handel
so depending on how you treat the that handel held over she either modestly mcbath or was modestly outraised by mcbath
however handel s total was artificially inflated by the and expensive battle she waged against ossoff the previous year
so the outside spending edge for mcbath actually dwarfed the candidate spending edge for handel
