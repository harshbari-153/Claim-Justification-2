Florida is "one of the few states that has actually had a narrowing of the achievement gap based on income, or based on race or ethnicity."
bush said florida is one of the few states that has actually had a narrowing of the achievement gap based on income or based on race or ethnicity
florida continues to be one of the states that does the best with kids and we are one of the few states that has actually had a narrowing of the achievement gap based on income or based on race or ethnicity
is bush correct that florida is one of the few states that narrowed the achievement gap for minorities and the poor we took a closer look
that claim checks out an education department spokesman confirmed that florida was the only state to narrow that gap for both grade levels and for subject matters for that specific time span
overall then bush has a point about florida narrowing the gap but the support for florida having narrowed the gap is weak
