Electric vehicles would not have fared well in the Virginia snowstorm traffic jam.
a facebook post implied that a massive traffic pileup during a virginia snowstorm would have been far worse with more electric vehicles on the road
in december politifact examined a similar claim that said electric vehicles are more likely to fail in traffic jams in cold weather
imagine if half the cars in the traffic jam on in virginia last night were electric vehicles
there s no evidence electric vehicles fare worse than cars in long traffic jams
but there is no evidence to suggest electric vehicles idling in standstill traffic would have fared any worse than vehicles which need a running engine to provide heat and can run out of gas while idling
