"Our country's got this huge debt, and (President Barack) Obama says raise taxes and keep spending more."
our country got this huge debt the ad says and obama says raise taxes and keep spending more does washington know we ca afford more taxes and debt there s got to be a way to take away president obama s blank check
in this item we re focusing on the question of whether obama s approach is to raise taxes and keep spending more
however we think that what obama and carney have said and what has trickled out from comments by the negotiators including the acknowledgement by cantor of common ground on spending cuts undercuts the ad s claim that obama s intention is to keep spending more
that said we do think there s enough information on the obama administration s position on taxes and spending to enable us to judge whether the president has really said his approach is to raise taxes and keep spending more
does he also want to keep spending more as we analyzed this question we assumed that spending more meant actually increasing levels of spending
