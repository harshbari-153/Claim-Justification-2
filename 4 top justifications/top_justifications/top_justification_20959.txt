Says Clint Eastwood called Barack Obama an "incompetent, lying, insincere, narcissistic, double-talking, socialist hypocrite, and fiscally irresponsible moron who spent eight years in the White House trying to … turn our wonderful country into a Muslim loving, socialist sh--hole like the one he came from, and I don’t mean Hawaii!"
