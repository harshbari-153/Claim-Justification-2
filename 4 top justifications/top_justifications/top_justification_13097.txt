we have literally people who voted in this election who don t live in nevada american conservative union chair matt schlapp told fox news on nov
as supporters of president donald trump ramp up their efforts to delegitimize the election with unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter fraud one republican ally claimed that nevada ballots were fraudulently cast by nonresidents
but there is no proof that people cast illegal ballots in nevada after moving out of state and there remains no evidence of any widespread voter fraud in nevada or elsewhere
an american conservative union spokesperson said schlapp had projected that the number of people who illegally voted from outside nevada was actually three times as large as the people originally alleged
