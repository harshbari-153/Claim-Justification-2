"Atheists are prohibited from holding office in 8 states."
and yet seven of the states mentioned in the post have language in their constitutions explicitly prohibiting atheists from holding office
states ban atheists from public office but supreme court ruling make those bans unenforceable
atheists are certainly free to run for congress but a recent social media post said they are prohibited from holding office in states
while seven states still have clear language in their constitutions banning atheists from holding public office pennsylvania s constitution isn t as clear cut
but it notes that pennsylvania differs from the other seven states in that its rule is that believers can t be disqualified from office but says nothing about atheists
