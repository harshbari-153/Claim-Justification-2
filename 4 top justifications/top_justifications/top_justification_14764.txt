Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker "has threatened to call out the National Guard if workers protest against" changes to bargaining laws.
group says gov scott walker threatened to send out the national guard if workers protest his proposed changes to bargaining laws
the progressive change campaign committee said walker threatened to call out the national guard if workers protest against these cuts the governor spoke of possibly calling up the guard if state workers didn t show up for work but he made no reference to using it in response to protests
we asked the progressive committee for evidence to back its claim that walker threatened to summon the national guard in response to protests
that contained this line in bold walker has threatened to call out the national guard if workers protest against these cuts it goes on to say the idea that a governor can use the military to impose his personal political will on the people he governs is a primitive relic of the past one that resulted in a century of bloodshed in this country
but did he threaten to call out the national guard in response to protests and did he threaten to use them in this manner to use force to impose his personal political will like the progressive committee citizen action of wisconsin issued a news release the same day that condemned walker s threat of force and mentioned the king assassination
