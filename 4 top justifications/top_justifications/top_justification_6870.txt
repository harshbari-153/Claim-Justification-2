Says, "when this governor came to office, he had (an) 11 billion dollar  - I call it mismanagement – deficit."
our ruling bramnick said during a roundtable discussion on njtv s on the record with michael aron that when this governor came to office he had an billion dollar i call it mismanagement deficit
when this governor came to office he had an billion dollar i call it mismanagement deficit bramnick said adding that christie has been working to improve the state s finances
so there was an approximate billion deficit when christie took office but in theory only
bramnick s right that christie took office with an billion deficit but that number is a theoretical figure only
bramnick s right that a deficit existed when christie came into office but it was a theoretical one that resulted because administrations prior to christie s didn t spend all of the money needed to fully fund required expenses a move christie repeated for his first budget as governor
