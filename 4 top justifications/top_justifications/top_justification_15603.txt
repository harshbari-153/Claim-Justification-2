grassley said that the biden administration ignores the negative environmental impact created by lithium mining
but grassley continued the biden administration ignores the negative environmental impact created by lithium mining needed for ev batteries and power storage
mining lithium poses environmental risks the biden administration isn t ignoring them
people might argue that the administration isn t doing enough but there s no evidence that the administration is ignoring the downsides of lithium mining
but grassley s claim goes too far in saying the administration is ignoring the problems lithium extraction poses in its push for electric vehicles
