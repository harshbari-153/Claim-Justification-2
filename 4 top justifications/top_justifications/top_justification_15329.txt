"We just had someone last week in Neenah near a school kill someone with a bow and arrow."
walker responded by discussing a homicide involving a bow and arrow near a neenah school
walker said too much attention is paid to the weapon in such shootings and cited a recent case as an example we just had someone last week in neenah near a school kill someone with a bow and arrow
what s more while the incident was near a school
there was only one problem with walker s statement about the bow and arrow murder
i believe he was referring the recent standoff that involved a bow and arrow
