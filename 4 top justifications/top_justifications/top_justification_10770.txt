the only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is mitch mcconnell
a grimes ad claimed that the only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is mitch mcconnell
first is mcconnell pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal and second is he the only candidate taking money from activists
how about the other side of the equation that mcconnell is the only candidate pocketing big money from groups
for example mcconnell received in campaign contributions from david litman a texas businessman who started texas business for clean air to oppose new coal plants there
