"We are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana."
sanders said we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana
but is it true that as sanders put it the united states is imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana we decided to take a closer look
we have a criminal justice system that lets ceos on wall street walk away and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana
and that includes all drugs not just marijuana
the vast majority of time the people who are in jail for marijuana possession also have other things that are part of their record
