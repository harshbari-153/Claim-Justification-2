Says IBM leader told Obama that using IBM technology to cut fraud could "pay for" health care reform.
gingrich who was debating herman cain said the ceo of ibm went to the white house and said to president barack obama you can pay for virtually all of obamacare by simply taking existing ibm technology and applying it to stop paying crooks
gingrich says ibm made obama an offer to save billions on health care
but was he right that ibm presented the president with such a scheme by way of background we note that gingrich has long advocated using technology to help cut costs
lepow initially said companies including ibm had offered the administration help fighting fraud
i said take the ibm discount take the ibm discount
