Video shows "Russian tank column totally destroyed by attack helicopter."
a recent facebook post shared a video featuring combat scenes and alleged that it is footage of a russian tank column totally destroyed by attack helicopter
the claim that a video shows a russian tank column totally destroyed by an attack helicopter is wrong
no this isn t a real video of russian tanks getting destroyed
because this video looked similar to the clips used in those false claims we searched youtube for arma and some of the key words in the facebook post tank column and attack helicopter
we ve previously claims that took snippets from arma and presented it as footage of russia attacking ukraine and china trying to attack taiwan
