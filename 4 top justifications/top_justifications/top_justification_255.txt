A president must "obtain Congress' consent before formally accepting the Nobel Prize."
three republican members of congress wrote president barack obama a letter telling him he needs to obtain congress consent before formally accepting the nobel prize
even if the nobel prize would be considered as coming from a foreign government there is compelling evidence that a president does not have to seek special permission from congress because congress already allows it via statute
does obama need congress permission to get nobel
we wanted to know if the representatives were correct that obama has to obtain the permission of congress before accepting the prize which he was awarded for his diplomatic efforts on international cooperation and nuclear disarmament
thus it seems clear that the statute already supplies the congressional consent for president obama to accept the nobel peace prize and no further action by congress is needed provided that president obama signs the check over to the government as the statute requires kopel wrote
