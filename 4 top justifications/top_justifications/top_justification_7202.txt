During the debate, Kamala Harris said, "thatâ€™s a great segway to the next question," suggesting she knew the next question.
kamala said to the moderator yes that s a great segway to the next question the post says misspelling segue
how did she know what the next question was
at that point in the debate page was speaking over pence and harris was speaking over page but essentially pence finished speaking and page said that s a good segue into our third question
we reached out to the biden campaign about the campaign post and to clarify what harris meant when she said that s a great segue
but at the beginning of the debate page addressed what pence harris and the commission on presidential debates knew about the event
