"The conviction rate is almost exactly the same" for whites and blacks who commit murder.
giuliani said the conviction rate is almost exactly the same for whites and blacks who commit murder
so we decided to take a closer look at giuliani s claim that the conviction rate is almost exactly the same for whites and blacks who commit murder
the conviction rate is almost exactly the same
the conviction rate for homicide represents only a sliver of criminal justice cases and are not necessarily representative of the deep disparity between black and white defendants
and this finding means that account for a grossly disproportionate percentage of murder convictions since whites and hispanics currently make up about percent of the nation s population compared to just percent for blacks
