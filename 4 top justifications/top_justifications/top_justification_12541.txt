"The bill also provides full federal funding for abortionsâ€¦"
two independent observers of the debate concur that the law does intend full federal funding of abortions
john carter says health care law provides full federal funding for abortions but that not so
we sought carter backup for his contention that the law provides full federal funding for abortions
besides the provision doesn t mean that full federal funding would pay for abortions as carter claims
stone said the provision implies that other federally administered plans could cover elective abortions or perhaps even be required to do so by the federal administrator
