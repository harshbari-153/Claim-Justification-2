"I've seen (life) from the factory floor when I was working the graveyard shift ...and I'd be ankle-deep in water at the Murray Ohio bicycle plant where I was running a machine that was so loud I couldn't hear myself yell if I wanted to."
i seen it from the factory floor when i was working the graveyard shift and we have lunch there on the change of the shifts and i be in water at the murray ohio bicycle plant where i was running a machine that was so loud i could hear myself yell if i wanted to
he said this
former workers also agree that many sections of the massive factory were extremely loud
i do know why he said that said doyce shaddix who worked at murray for years and said the roof did sometimes leak in the rain
we could verify the water conditions and you never know from his speech that thompson view of life from the factory floor lasted just one summer before college
