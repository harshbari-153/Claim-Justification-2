Statistics show "you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver" in Austin than a driver for a ride-hailing service.
troxclair said statistics show you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver in austin than a driver for a service
when you look at the number of taxi drivers and the number of tnc drivers and the number of complaints that apd the austin police department has received over that time you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver
troxclair who represents district in southwest austin elaborated the truth is if you look at the statistics based on when tncs came to town and today you are about nine times more likely to be assaulted by a taxi driver
vital data at the least about the number and length of trips by taxi cabs or vehicles remains to be seen making it impossible to definitively say which type of driver or ride more likely risks an assault
searle wrote if the estimate is that there are tnc drivers subject to background checks and there are cab permits subject to fingerprint background check then you are times more likely to be assaulted by a cab driver than a tnc driver in austin
