"If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan."
but at this point it seems too pat to say if you like your health care plan you can keep your health care plan
president barack obama repeated a line he used many times in describing his health care proposal if you like your health care plan you can keep your health care plan
here is the core of obama somewhat lengthy answer when i say if you have your plan and you like it or you have a doctor and you like your doctor that you do have to change plans what i saying is the government is not going to make you change plans under health reform
barack obama promises you can keep your health insurance but there no guarantee
his plan seeks to build on the system we have now where most people get health insurance through their employers
