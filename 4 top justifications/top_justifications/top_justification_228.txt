A "regulatory thing" means you canâ€™t show someone drinking beer on camera.
but we wondered about the director s claim that a regulatory thing stops people from drinking beer in commercials
a heineken beer commercial said regulations ban showing someone drinking beer on camera
for all the fun you see people having in beer commercials the one thing you won t see is someone actually drinking beer
we can t actually show you drinking heineken light on camera
harris what do you mean why can t i drink it
