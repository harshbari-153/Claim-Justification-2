Says Kansas City Chiefs CEO Clark Hunt said, "You will stand, with your hand over your heart and with respect, when our countryâ€™s national anthem is being played or you will no longer be a Kansas City Chief."
you will stand with your hand over your heart and with respect when our country s national anthem is being played or you will no longer be a kansas city chief a coach for the kansas city chiefs or have any association with the chiefs organization
kansas city chiefs ceo clark hunt says this statement attributed to him is a hoax
it shows an image of what purports to be a statement made by clark hunt the team s chief executive officer and chairman during a meeting he called with his coaches players and field staff in
here s what hunt has actually said about anthem protests it s not something where i ve spoken specifically to the players or any specific player about it
but the entire team knows that our desire is for them to stand during the national anthem
