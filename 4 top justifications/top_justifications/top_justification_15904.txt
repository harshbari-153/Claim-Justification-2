post said irma was on a path to obliterate new york city s five boroughs and most of new jersey and that it was set to make landfall in new york harbor as a category hurricane at noon on sept
it s too soon to tell where the storm is headed next and the national weather service hasn t made any announcements on irma s potential impact on new york or new jersey or on its future wind speed which determines its category
