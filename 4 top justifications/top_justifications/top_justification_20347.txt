Requesting a chargeback is "a better way to get back at" GoFundMe.
requesting a chargeback probably isn t the best way to back at gofundme
with refunds already promised what does that mean for the effort to hit gofundme with fees
a facebook post claimed that disputing credit card charges for gofundme freedom convoy donations and trying to hit gofundme with chargeback fees was a better way to get back at the company
go fund me will be forced to cover the chargeback fees which are usually per chargeback
facebook post that also shared an image with the words gofundme charge back
