Blames Mike McIntyre and Nancy Pelosi for the second straight year of no cost-of-living increases for Social Security beneficiaries.
mike mcintyre and nancy pelosi their spending is putting our social security at risk
but mcintyre and pelosi big spending is robbing our social security trust fund
short of changing the law there nothing mcintyre or pelosi could have done to provide beneficiaries with an increase in either of the two years
second some people contributing to social security will actually benefit from not having a social security increase
when benefits do go up neither does the limit on earnings subject to the social security payroll tax
