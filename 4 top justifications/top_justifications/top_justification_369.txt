"Even if you took literally every single ounce of platinum in the world, it still wouldn’t add up to enough needed to pay down our nation’s debt."
well even if you took literally every single ounce of platinum in the world it still wouldn t add up to enough needed to pay down our nation s debt the release stated
even by the most generous counts the total value of the the world s platinum supply is only a fraction of the national debt
nrcc compares the nation debt to all the word platinum takes aim at trillion dollar coin
but according to the republican campaign committee not even all the platinum in all the world could solve america s spending problems
our ruling there are no formal counts of platinum production dating back before but based on recent records and historical accounts there is no evidence to suggest the value of the world s total platinum supply comes within reach of the national debt
