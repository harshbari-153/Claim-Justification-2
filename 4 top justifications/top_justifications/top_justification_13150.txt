Says "I was the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney."
our ruling christie was one of the most ardent supporters of romney for president and stated several times in recent months that i was the first governor in america to endorse mitt romney
but it doesn t take away for a minute the fact that i was the first governor in america to endorse mitt romney that i traveled literally tens of thousands of miles for him raised tens of millions of dollars for him and worked harder i think than any other surrogate in america other than paul ryan he continued
we determined in a september that christie was one of the first republican governors to endorse romney but he wasn t the first
chris christie claims again that he was first governor to endorse mitt romney for president
but a couple of other governors threw their support behind romney first
