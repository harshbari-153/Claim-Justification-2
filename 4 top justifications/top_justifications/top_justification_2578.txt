"There's no court session between now and the end of this election."
and by the way there s no court session between now and the end of this election
biden said there no court session between now and the end of this election
biden wrong to say supreme court has no session before election day
in the speech biden said the constitution was designed to give voters one chance one chance to have their voice heard in who serves on the court
that s disproven by the supreme court s own website which lists five days of oral arguments in october and two more in november before the polls close
