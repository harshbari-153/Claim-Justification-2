"Technically, (Ted Cruz is) not even an American."
the suggestion that cruz isn t an american is patently wrong
grayson wrongly says cruz not an american
well congressman cruz is an american by any definition
grayson said that cruz is ineligible to be president because technically he s not american
we pressed grayson on whether he actually meant that cruz is not an american and he raised the idea that his very citizenship gained through his mother is flawed
