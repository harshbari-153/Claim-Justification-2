"Target to discontinue sale of Holy Bible."
with the headline target to discontinue sale of holy bible
target did not stop selling the bible in stores despite fake news reports
a fake news story that claimed discount store chain target would no longer sell the bible doesn t stand up to a more careful reading
but the story veers into false territory by saying target ceo bryan hornell claimed the chain will no longer cater to religious extremists by selling the bible
hornell allegedly said in a letter that targets would start phasing out anything related to religion including christmas decorations in its stores
