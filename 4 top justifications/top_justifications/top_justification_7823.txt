ingraham said the percent statistic of supporting background checks that been debunked
the percent statistic of supporting background checks that been debunked ingraham said on fox news sunday on jan
for example in polls found that percent of americans supported expanded background checks
we couldn t find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation
while there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings such as whether that support translates into support for specific legislation there hasn t been a definitive debunking of the statistic
