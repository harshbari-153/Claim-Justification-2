The jobs bill includes "President Obama's tax on soup kitchens"
we wondered if it was accurate for cantor s office to say that the jobs bill includes president obama tax on soup kitchens
the post was headlined president obama tax on soup kitchens and it criticized a tax provision included in obama s jobs bill
our ruling cantor blog post was headlined president obama tax on soup kitchens
but is it fair to call the provision in the jobs bill a tax on soup kitchens clearly that not what it is
first obama did not single out soup kitchens for special tax treatment
