kennedy wrote that marijuana and thc have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket
to say that marijuana is causing emergency room visits to skyrocket is unfounded based on the limited data that has been collected
we can not conclusively say that marijuana has caused an increase in visits to the emergency room
we decided to look at the numbers and determine if marijuana really has caused emergency room visits to increase
