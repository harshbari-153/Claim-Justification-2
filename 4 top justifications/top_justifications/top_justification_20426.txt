"Trump Removing Marines From the Navy."
an article on the website is headlined trump removing marines from the navy
we rate the vet tv statement that trump is removing the marines from the navy as pants on firestory that donald trump will split marines from navy is unfounded
the article claims president trump will sign executive order this november on the birthday of the marine corps freeing the marines from the department of the navy
the navy referred politifact to the office of the secretary of defense which referred us to the white house
