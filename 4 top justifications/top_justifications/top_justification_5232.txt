Says Republican state leaders are using "Soviet-style" budget management.
so are there soviet style ways that state leaders have approached the budget
we asked the professors if soviet style accurately characterizes the gop leaders request for proposed budget cuts
our conclusion the gop leaders request that agencies submit proposed budget cuts isn t soviet style not even close
white said if he in charge it won t be done by things that are just across the board soviet style you know budget management that only career politicians seem to embrace
gardner agreed saying it s a bit hyperbolic to refer to this budget cutting as soviet style
