"FACT: Less than 1% of the trash in the ocean is from the United States."
a recent facebook post by the group said fact less than of the trash in the ocean is from the united states
in a facebook post young america s foundation said fact less than of the trash in the ocean is from the united states
does just of ocean waste come from the united states
the upshot is that we don t have a great idea of how big a contributor the united states is to ocean plastic pollution
it s possible that the united states accounted for a larger share of existing plastic waste that migrated to the ocean many years before
