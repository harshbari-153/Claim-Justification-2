Says Jeb Bush "said he would take his pants off and moon everybody ... Nobody reports that."
trump said that bush said he would take his pants off and moon everybody
two days ago he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody trump said feb
so it was actually bush who suggested in jest here to the boston globe reporter that he could even pull down his pants and moon people and he still would get no media attention
donald trump wrongly says jeb bush said he would everybody and reports that
but trump s statement is misleading because bush wasn t threatening to moon people and his comment was indeed reported
