Says there are "ample means" to "tell when someone is a Christian in the Middle East ... by name, by where theyâ€™re born, their birth certificates."
bush said there are ample ways to determine if a middle eastern refugee is a christian and suggested that names birthplace and birth certificate would be key
there are ample means by which to know this
you can tell when someone is a christian in the middle east i can promise you that bush said on nh today
we thought we d explore the markers of christian identity in the middle east
middle eastern christians are as diverse as western christians are and some will be much more knowledgeable than others and much more able to express themselves than others
