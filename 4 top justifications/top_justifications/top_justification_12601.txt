Says Democrats "have issued more subpoenas than theyâ€™ve passed bills."
they have issued more subpoenas than they ve passed bills
shields said democrats have issued more subpoenas than they ve passed bills
democrats have issued subpoenas while passing just bills that went on to become laws
but the claim that house democrats are responsible for more subpoenas than bills passed into law is also misleading since it compares two very different processes
it more subpoenas than they have had laws
