"Obamacare â€¦ carries on even under a government shutdown."
ryan said that obamacare carries on even under a government shutdown
obamacare is an entitlement like medicare and social security is and so the entitlement carries on even under a government shutdown scenario said ryan who is also the house budget chairman
a shutdown last occurred in the mid when president bill clinton squared off against a new republican majority in the house and senate
paul ryan says government shutdown would sideline obamacare
while these are all part of the health care law a government shutdown wouldn t really affect them
