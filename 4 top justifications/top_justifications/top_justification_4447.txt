On foreign policy, Joe Biden was against aid for Vietnam, said the fall of the Shah was "a step forward" for human rights in Iran, opposed Reagan's defense build-up and voted against the first Gulf War.
biden said when the shah fell in iran in
biden voted against the first gulf war
however we found no solid evidence that biden actually said the fall of the shah was a step forward for human rights in iran
gates assessments of biden s positions on south vietnamese aid the reagan defense and the first gulf war are accurate according to our research
biden later said he wasn t against the war for moral reasons i just thought it was stupid policy
