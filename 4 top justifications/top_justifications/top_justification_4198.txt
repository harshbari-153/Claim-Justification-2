"This would be the largest casino in the United States."
technically this would not be the largest casino in the united states
at the event campaign spokeswoman cynara lilly told reporters that the grange as it s called would be the largest casino in the united states
lilly said that the proposed casino in wood village would be the largest in the country which is not only inaccurate but downright ridiculous
many of these are in the midwest and in the east so lilly is on the rightish track when she tells politifact oregon that a wood village casino with slot machines would be the largest casino on the west coast
that would top the number of video slot machines at oregon s largest tribal casino the grand ronde s spirit mountain casino but is pretty much the norm for the big players in las vegas
