When Republicans last controlled the presidency and Congress, "the number of people on food stamps (and) the number of people in low-income housing went through the roof."
grothman said that when republicans last controlled the presidency and congress from roughly to the number of people on food stamps and the number of people in housing went through the roof
during that time the number of people on food stamps the number of people in housing went through the roof
after having declined for a number of years the number of people receiving food stamps increased percent during the period as the bush administration and congress widened eligibility and encouraged more eligible people to apply
so let s see if there was huge growth in food stamps and housing during the period grothman cites and if so whether the gop was responsible
and that came after a span from to when the number of food stamp recipients declined by percent
