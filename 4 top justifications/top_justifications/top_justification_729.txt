"Social Security is a Ponzi scheme."
loughlin compares social security to a ponzi scheme
in perhaps the most extensive example loughlin had this to say while speaking in february at a rhode island voter coalition forum for those of you who have retired yet social security is a ponzi scheme
if he right and social security is indeed a ponzi scheme it would make madoff billion fraud look like child play
but there is a second critical component that defines a ponzi scheme fraud
a ponzi scheme is guaranteed to run aground when the pool of investors is tapped out whereas the social security administration troubles could be remedied by raising taxes or other restructuring should the federal government choose to do so he said
