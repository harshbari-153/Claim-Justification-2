In Iraq, "civilian deaths, incidents of bombings, etc., remain very low relative to what was going on last year."
obama specifically said civilian deaths and bombings have decreased relative to what was going on last year
well first of all i think it important to note that although you seen some spectacular bombings in iraq that are a legitimate cause of concern civilian deaths incidents of bombings et cetera remain very low relative to what was going on last year for example obama said
the number of civilian deaths and bombings in iraq peaked during and has steadily decreased since a surge of forces was approved by president george w
that dramatically lower than late and early when civilian deaths were about a month
obama correct that civilian deaths and bombings are down in iraq
