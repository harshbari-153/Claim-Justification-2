"U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!"
johnny isakson has voted for trillion of our national debt
johnny isakson has voted for trillion of our national debt buckley states on his website as part of a graphic about isakson votes to raise the federal debt limit
is that possible has isakson who has pushed for a balanced budget amendment and who also blasts the federal debt on his campaign website actually assisted the spending spree
isakson did indeed vote to raise the debt ceiling so buckley has a valid point
isakson has irresponsibly and immorally voted to grow the federal government through debt spending to the detriment of young people and our country
