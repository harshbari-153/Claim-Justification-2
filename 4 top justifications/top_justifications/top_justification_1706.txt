The Human Rights Campaign is "more powerful than the NRA."
mccrory said the main group against the human rights campaign is more powerful than the nra
the human rights council my gosh they re more powerful than the nra mccrory said meaning the human rights campaign and the national rifle association
gov pat mccrory under fire on says human rights campaign is powerful than the nra
it s a strong claim given the nra s reputation for power and influence and even the hrc spokesman was unwilling to embrace it
but has the group really eclipsed the nra an stereotype of a powerful lobbying group that can shape public policy and opinion
