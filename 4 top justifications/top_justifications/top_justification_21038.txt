"San Francisco Allowing Children to ‘Consent’ to Covid Vaccine Without Parents Approval."
in bold letters the post reads san francisco allowing children to consent to covid vaccine without parents approval
medical experts agree with the city and county of san francisco that healthcare providers must do everything possible to get consent from a parent or legal guardian prior to administering a vaccine to a minor
at the bottom of the post is a snippet from a san francisco county health order that attempts to justify the claim that minors are receiving vaccines without parental consent
even with the health order it s not as easy for minors to consent to the vaccine on their own behalf
in an email sfdph said generally parent or legal guardian consent is required for vaccinations of minors
