"Every Republican Senate candidate has now announced whether or not they support the Senate taking up the Supreme Court vacancyâ€¦except for Congressman Heck."
the nevada democratic party says that every republican senate candidate has announced their position on the supreme court vacancy except for heck
every republican senate candidate has now taken a position on the issue of whether the senate should go a whole year without doing its job but all we get from congressman heck are and she said in a press release on feb
it s quite a claim to say that literally every republican senatorial candidate has taken a position on any issue much less the supreme court vacancy so we decided to look into it
in total we found at least candidates who issued vague statements not specifically spelling out what they believe the senate should do regarding the court vacancy and many more who didn t announce any position on their website or social media accounts
but one attack stuck out as particularly noteworthy the claim that every republican senate candidate other than heck has announced a position on taking up the vacancy
