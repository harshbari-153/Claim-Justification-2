A new Rasmussen poll shows people "oppose (Sotomayor's) confirmation. Only 37 percent support it."
but his comment leaves the impression that a solid majority opposes sotomayor nomination
sotomayor fans could use the same data to say that only percent oppose her nomination
and a gallup poll conducted after the rasmussen poll but released the day after kyl made his remarks found that percent favored sotomayor nomination with percent opposed and percent having no opinion
it interesting that i just reviewed the rasmussen poll most recent poll about american public opinion about judge sotomayor
kyl specifically cited the rasmussen poll though and he got the number who favored confirmation right
