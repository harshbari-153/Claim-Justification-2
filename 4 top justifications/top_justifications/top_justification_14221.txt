"There was tremendous cheating in New York"
i think there was tremendous cheating in california there was tremendous cheating in new york and other places
we were curious about his claim of tremendous cheating in new york in the last presidential election
but in the interview trump talked about how he won the popular vote in a true sense and made claims about tremendous cheating in new york and california
though we can t know for sure new york has had some voting irregularities that trump could have had in mind when he said that
the operative who worked in new jersey and mentored operatives in other states including new york said that tactics to manipulate an election result such as knocking on voters doors and asking residents to hand over their ballots so the operative can tamper with it later have been used for decades
