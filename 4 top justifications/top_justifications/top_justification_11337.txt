"Mark Kirk: Lied about going to war. Opposed middle class tax cuts. And said unemploymentâ€™s not that big an issue."
so does that mean kirk opposed tax cuts we think that misleading
last is the claim that kirk said unemployment s not that big an issue
the second claim in the ad is that kirk opposed tax cuts
according to the mark kirk lied about going to war
agree or not with his ideas the positions suggest that kirk believes unemployment is a serious issue
