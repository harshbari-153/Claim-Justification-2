"If you look at California, if you look at people of color in general, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans, we won that big time. Big time. Not even close."
but i think if you look at california if you look at people of color in general latinos we won that big time
still mitchell said it s reasonable to say sanders won people of color in california given that latinos make up the greatest share of that group
while are a smaller share of the state s population than latinos and asians it was misleading for sanders to lump them in when talking about a big time victory among people of color
was sanders right did he really score a big victory with people of color in california including
fact check did bernie sanders win people of color in california and was it not even close
