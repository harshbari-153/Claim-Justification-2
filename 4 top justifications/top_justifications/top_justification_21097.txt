Tells David Cicilline, "94 percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature."
i mean percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature
so hansen is saying that percent of the increase in carbon dioxide emissions is coming from nature not the percent claimed by loughlin
when people talk about carbon emissions they are mostly talking about carbon dioxide the gas we exhale and the gas plants need to grow
he agreed with hansen saying that nature sends a lot of carbon in and out of the atmosphere every year and the sources can be pinpointed because carbon has a slightly different composition than the carbon that is constantly recycled by nature
he went on to tell cicilline i saying really the earth is warming but it not conclusively caused by man
