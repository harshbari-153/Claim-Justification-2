Says attorney general candidate Jon Richards "went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed."
schimel said richards went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed
has richards said he would only enforce laws he agrees with
and in neither case does richards say he would enforce only laws he agrees with
on the contrary richards has said on multiple occasions he would enforce laws with which he doesn t agree
so that s an indication that richards might not defend some laws if he thinks they are against the public s wishes but not that he would defend only laws he supports
