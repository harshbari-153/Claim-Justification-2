"This type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesnâ€™t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."
but let s be clear at some point we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries
in sum then obama is wrong to say that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries
obama said after the church shootings in charleston that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries
an important point to make right off the bat is that many of the critics have pointed to the first part of obama s claim that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries
still using this data it s easy to dispense with the first claim obama made that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries
