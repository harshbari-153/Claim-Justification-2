Says when an interviewer asked Donald Trump if he treats women with respect, Trump replied, "I can't say that."
hillary clinton in a campaign ad shown at the democratic convention said that when an interviewer asked donald trump if he treats women with respect trump replied i ca say that
the opening question of whether trump said he treats women like feces trump denial stern assessment that it somewhere in between and trump subsequent response that i treat women with great respect are all missing
