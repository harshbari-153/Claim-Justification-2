With Obamacare, "You have no options .. you can't get competitive bidding."
trump said that under obamacare you have no options for health insurance plans
trump wrongly says obamacare has options competitive bidding
but we were struck by his statement that right now you have no options
when nbc host chuck todd asked him about his view on mandates trump said no one would be forced to buy health insurance unlike the law says today
right now you have no options
