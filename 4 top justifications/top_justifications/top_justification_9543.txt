In Japan, executives of failing companies "say 'I'm sorry' and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide."
we wondered if grassley was right that japanese executives who make significant mistakes often apologize and then resign or commit suicide
and in the case of the japanese they usually commit suicide before they make any apology
executives in japan do not regularly commit suicide
we found many news stories of japanese executives apologizing a process in which the person stands and bows deeply
but i would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little bit better toward them if they follow the japanese example and come before the american people and take that deep bow and say i sorry and then either do one of two things resign or go commit suicide
