"We spend more money on health care per capita in the United States than any other country in the world. Of the 30 developed countries in the world, we spend 2 1/2 times more than the average. Of the country that spends the second most per capita, Switzerland, we spend 175 percent more."
of the country that spends the second most per capita switzerland we spend percent more
gov david dewhurst says the united states spends the most money per capita on health care more than the average cost of other countries and percent more than switzerland
of the developed countries in the world he said we spend times more than the average
dewhurst was speaking off the cuff perhaps he meant to say that we spend percent of switzerland health care costs per capita which translates into spending percent more much closer to the percent figure
recap as far as we can tell and keeping in mind that dewhurst did respond to our queries for backup he was in saying the united states spends more money on health care per capita than the rest of the world and he right that we spend times more than the average cost of all the oecd countries
