New and proposed state laws on voting mean "if you are going to be standing in that line for all those hours, you canâ€™t have any water or any food."
harris said new or proposed state laws on voting mean if you are going to be standing in that line for hours you can t have any water or any food
they are saying well if you are going to be standing in that line for all those hours you can t have any water or any food
the bill also states that poll workers can make available water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote
nationwide we found laws that expressly ban distributing food and water to voters are scarce
the most restrictive law we could find about food and water for voters is in georgia
