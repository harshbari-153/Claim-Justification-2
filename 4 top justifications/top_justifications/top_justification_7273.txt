Barack Obama wants to "restore" the estate tax that George W. Bush "repealed."
so the is wrong when it says mccain wants a percent estate tax and that obama wants to restore it
bush repealed the estate tax and it now stands at percent
both obama and mccain support renewing the current estate tax with a few changes
here we look at the claims about barack obama and the estate tax which it refers to as the inheritance tax
though bush reduced the tax he did not repeal it
