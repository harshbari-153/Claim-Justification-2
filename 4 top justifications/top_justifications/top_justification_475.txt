All members of Congress are required to be in Obamacare, but Obama and members of his administration "have their own gold-plated health care plans that they're in."
duffy said all members of congress are required to be in obamacare but obama and members of his administration have their own health care plans that they in
why should members of congress be in obamacare and not the president explain that one
the president should join us in obamacare and the rest of america
is duffy right that members of congress are required to buy health insurance through the affordable care act marketplaces while obama and his staff can keep their their own health care plan
he argued that if the health care law is so good obama and members his administration should have to buy their insurance from the marketplaces just like members of congress
