"Shelby County donated – I’m sorry, gave – 44 schools to the city of Memphis."
so who is right here on an issue of utmost importance as shelby county s system of public schools goes through an historic transition at least since have annexations resulted in shelby county just giving school buildings to memphis s special school district memphis city schools we found a complicated set of legal and historical circumstances and as with other issues associated with the impending transfer of memphis s public schools to the county stances that have reversed over time depending on residency
our ruling so did shelby county in fact give school buildings to memphis city schools as the consultants note exactly
meaning the county had not gotten payment from memphis for schools during annexations
some of the suburban municipalities in fact benefitted from new schools or renovations made possible by memphis agreeing to credit the county for some value of schools it took over
thomas s statement is worth quoting in full because it captures the prevailing suburban view i think it s funny over the past many years that shelby county donated i m sorry gave schools to the city of memphis
