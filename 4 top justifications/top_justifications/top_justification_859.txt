yes it is true that pharmaceutical companies compensate generic competitors to hold off on marketing their versions of drugs
manufacturers do not in all cases literally pay off generic drugmakers
is a pharmaceutical industry practice that involves drugmakers compensating their generic counterparts for holding off on marketing their versions of drugs causing longer delays in getting cheaper generic drugs to the pharmacy counter
