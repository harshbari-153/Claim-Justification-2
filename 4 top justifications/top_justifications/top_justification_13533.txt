"Obamacare could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service or close entirely!"
obamacare could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service the post alleges or close entirely
the facebook post said obamacare could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service or close entirely could is a dangerous word that allows rabble rousers to generate hysteria without being completely false but we think it s somewhat inflated
but let s get back to what the graphic said the affordable care act could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service or close entirely
will the affordable care act close down volunteer fire departments
it would also require the irs to go out and enforce the law and target volunteer fire stations
