The Democratic health care law "added 12 years of solvency to Medicare."
did the health care law add years of solvency to medicare
to summarize wasserman schultz said that the democratic health care law added years of solvency to medicare
in august the medicare board of trustees reported that the health care law did indeed add years of solvency to medicare part a the portion of medicare that covers hospitalization
but we were interested in the wonkier question of whether the health care law did indeed add years of solvency to medicare
nevertheless her overall point that the democrats health reform law added to the overall solvency of medicare is correct
