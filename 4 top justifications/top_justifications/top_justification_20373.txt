yes reads one instagram post that s a photo of hitler
in a poster showing netanyahu with a hitler mustache appeared at an art school in tel aviv and in demonstrators in sydney protested the prime minister s visit to australia calling him a war criminal and carrying a banner with netanyahu with a hitler mustache and the word fascist
it appears to be israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu with a hitler mustache drawn on his face as some people commenting on the photo pointed out
a closer look at the framed picture in the image shows that the portrait is not of hitler
