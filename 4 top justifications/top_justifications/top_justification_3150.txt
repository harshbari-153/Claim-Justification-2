Under Obama's budget plan, families making over $250,000 are "going to lose their mortgage deduction, their charitable deductions."
the issue here is whether the family of our tumbleweed farmer or any other family that makes more than would lose their mortgage charitable deductions under obama plan
cynthia lummis claims families who make over would lose their mortgage and charitable deductions under obama plan
but they better not make more than a year or they re going to lose their mortgage deduction their charitable deductions their taxes are going to go up
what we find egregious is her claim that these high earners would lose their mortgage and charitable deductions
that would be a shocking change because the mortgage deduction enjoys sacred protection in american tax law and the charitable contribution deduction is far behind
