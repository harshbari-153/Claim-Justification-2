"Every time we put a ballot issue on, it costs a million dollars."
every time we put a ballot issue on it costs a million dollars essentially to do that he said
that means the sb referendum cost the secretary of state s office more than million
he made his comment while specifically talking about the referendum for hb and his underlying point here was that referendums cost the state a lot of money
since the constitution requires all ballot issues be placed in newspapers across the state we can assume the state would have to pay for another million copies the same number of ads it had to buy for last year s ballot issues
we called husted s office and a spokesman said the price tag is due to the state s responsibility to educate the public about the law on the ballot
