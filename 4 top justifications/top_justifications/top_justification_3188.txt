Says a Roman statesman in 42 B.C. had a "warning about Trump" when he said 2,000 years ago that a nation "cannot survive treason from within."
a facebook post says a quote from roman public speaker and statesman cicero amounts to a two thousand year old warning about trump
but it can not survive treason from within
no a roman statesman did not warn about trump thousands of years ago
he rots the soul of a nation he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist
for the traitor appears not a traitor he speaks in the accents familiar to his victims and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men
