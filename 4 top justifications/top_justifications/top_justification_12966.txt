our ruling on a radio show last week christie claimed the national health care reform was a government takeover of health care
it s gon na be a government takeover of health care
chris christie slams health care reform as a government takeover of health care
by referring to the national reform as a government takeover of health care christie was repeating a claim that s been debunked numerous times by various news organizations
