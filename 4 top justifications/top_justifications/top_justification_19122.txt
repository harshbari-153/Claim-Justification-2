"Obama for President and Baldwin for Senate have kept their campaign offices up and running in Fox Valley, Eau Claire and La Crosse with their staffs preparing for the next battle."
obama for president and baldwin for senate have kept their campaign offices up and running in fox valley eau claire and la crosse with their staffs preparing for the next battle
but scott walker is correct that democrats are preparing for the next battle county democratic party offices remain open and staffed all over the state and the state party has organizers working in la crosse eau claire and the fox valley as part of our county strategy
we asked the state democratic party if they knew of any offices for obama or baldwin
we called each of the obama offices that had a phone number listed including those in the areas named by walker the fox valley eau claire and la crosse
but obama has run in his last election and baldwin is a just few months into a term
