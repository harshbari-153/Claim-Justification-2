"A cashier earning $20,000 per year pays the same (Virginia) income tax rate as a hedge fund manager earning $20 million per year."
a cashier earning per year pays the same virginia income tax rate as a hedge fund manager earning million a year he said
our ruling englin said a cashier earning a year would pay the same virginia tax rate as a hedge fund manager who makes million annually
but does that mean the hedge fund manager earning million annually and the cashier earning of that amount would pay the same tax rate the answer is no
del englin says cashier and rich hedge fund manager pay same virginia income tax rate
even a cashier with taxable income of would pay a lower overall rate than a hedge fund manager
