Spending increases, not tax cuts, are the major cause of the federal budget deficit.
faced with new projections showing a federal budget deficit for sen
but measuring how much of the legislative changes were due to taxes and how much were due to spending is trickier
until the rebates temporarily changed the equation spending increases did cause the majority of the deficit
for fiscal year percent of the legislatively caused deterioration came from spending and percent came from tax cuts
right but tax cuts were a major factor too
