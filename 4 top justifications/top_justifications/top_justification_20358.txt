"Most AGs don't go to court.."
so most ags do go to court and it not a primary requirement of the job
by looking at the three most recent examples in florida ags rarely go to court but it does happen
so where does that leave us benson said that most ags do appear in court
a number of ags do it but relatively few
supreme court or a higher court
