The health care reform plan would set limits similar to the "socialized" system in Britain, where people are allowed to die if their treatment would cost more than $22,000.
the carefully worded ad does directly say that the government is planning to put a price on our lives but the implication is clear the reform plan will lead to callous decisions that would allow people to die if they face a costly treatment
so that what we going to check whether the reform plan would impose those kind of caps on treatment
in england government health officials decided that how much six months of life is worth
and medicare does put a price on life
under their socialized system if a medical treatment costs more you out of luck
