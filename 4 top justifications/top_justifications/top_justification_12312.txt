Due to actions by President Barack Obama, "the Burger King national headquarters announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases."
the burger king national headquarters the email said announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases
the email said that due to actions by obama the burger king national headquarters announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases
however its most claim that burger king had announced it will be pulling its outlets from military bases was flat wrong
is burger king quitting its outlets because of barack obama policies
but the impact of such changes is speculative and as far as the specific claim about burger king is concerned it s pure fiction that the company announced a sweeping departure from military bases
