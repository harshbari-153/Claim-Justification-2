Says Deputy Comptroller Aycha Sawa "blocked an audit" of the Milwaukee lead program for three years that "put our children in danger" and spurred a criminal investigation.
for three years deputy comptroller aycha sawa and the milwaukee comptroller s office blocked an audit of milwaukee s lead abatement programs
a flier attacking sawa says she blocked an audit of the city s lead abatement program for three years that put our children in danger and spurred a criminal investigation
by the time lead concerns in milwaukee became more public sawa was no longer in charge of the audit division
