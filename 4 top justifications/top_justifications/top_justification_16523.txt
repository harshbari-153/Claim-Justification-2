The Obama White House is renaming Christmas trees "holiday trees."
a chain says that the obama white house is renaming christmas trees holiday trees
she added the trees in the white house will be called christmas trees and the tree on the ellipse will be called the national christmas tree
they will be called holiday trees
but i think we always called this the white house christmas tree
in the same year laura bush was asked whether she had any misgivings about calling the white house christmas tree a christmas tree
