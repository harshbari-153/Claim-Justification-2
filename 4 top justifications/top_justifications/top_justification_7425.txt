The new Atlanta Braves stadium will require no tax increase for homeowners and provide $3 million annually for Cobb County schools.
the group says there will be no tax increase for homeowners because the stadium won t cause their tax bills to rise
but now that the braves stadium is in the works to pay the county s million share of the bill commissioners will have to vote to increase property taxes for the general fund by the amount they would have decreased
before the braves stadium plan property taxes were set to decrease
but a reasonable person may consider the braves deal a tax increase over the amount he or she would have paid if the team had stayed in downtown atlanta
the county plans to exempt homeowners from a special tax it will levy for properties near the new stadium said james pehrson cobb county s finance director
