matthews said cheney athisized the iraqi government and created isis
we find that cheney played a key role in athification and in creating the circumstances that led to the formation of isis
he s the one that athisized the iraqi government and created isis

but matthew s statement requires that we explore two points was cheney responsible for athification and how might that have led to the creation of isis
