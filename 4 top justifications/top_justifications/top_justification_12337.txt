rick perry says that as governor mitt romney raised business taxes percent in massachusetts
in a tv ad airing in iowa rick perry said mitt romney raised business taxes percent when he was governor of massachusetts
is it fair to say romney drove up business taxes as perry said john regan spokesman for associated industries of massachusetts a group that represents employers suggested in an interview that weighing changes in tax rates alone would be misleading
