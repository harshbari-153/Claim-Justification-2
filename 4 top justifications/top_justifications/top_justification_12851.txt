"Maybe they’re just calling the common cold … the omicron variant."
a facebook post said maybe they re just calling the common cold the omicron variant
the omicron variant isn t the same as the common cold and public health officials aren t just calling the common cold omicron to scare people the cdc and five experts told politifact
however one of the study s authors told reuters that despite the firm s findings the claims that the omicron variant is really just the common cold are inaccurate
another potential reason for confusion among social media users a preliminary study from a massachusetts firm said that the omicron variant may have picked up some of its genetic material from another virus that causes the common cold
the suggestion that public health officials are just calling the common cold the omicron variant is totally off the mark added richard watanabe professor of preventive medicine at the university of southern california who said the coronavirus and its variants are genetically distinct from the flu and other viruses much like humans and cows are distinctly different
