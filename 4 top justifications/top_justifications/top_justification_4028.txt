"So the number on DACA is 800,000, but every one person can bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status. So it's 3 or 4 million, right?"
brat said so the number on daca is but every one person can bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status
how did brat determine that daca beneficiaries could bring in or million people
brat calculated the or million number based on a rough estimate of total immediate and extended family members potentially eligible for chain migration if daca recipients receive green card status
brat left us wondering if in fact daca recipients could bring in extended family members once they reach a certain status and if that could add up to million additional immigrants
if you want to know if people are going in good faith on immigration reform first you got to do and then you got to take a look at chain migration right so the number on daca is but every one person can bring in their entire extended family once they reach a certain status
