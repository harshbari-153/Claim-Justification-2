The Republican leadership's budget proposal "doesn't contain any numbers."
republican budget proposal lacks numbers on revenues and costs
it a budget proposal without proposing actual numbers
what the republican plan lacks is the numbers that really matter numbers that would show how much the republicans propose to spend on various parts of government
the first version of the republican road to recovery is a budget without budget numbers
we were curious if gibbs was right that the republican budget outline contained no numbers or if he was just being snarky
