"Oregon schools receive millions of dollars per year in federal school lunch assistance and yet they are required to spend that money almost anywhere but Oregon."
after it passed the oregon democrat drove home the point in a news release oregon schools receive millions of dollars per year in federal school lunch assistance and yet they are required to spend that money almost anywhere but oregon
there s no doubt that the federal government spends millions of dollars to pay for school meals in oregon
that program is small supplying only percent of the food used in school nutrition programs but wyden said the million a year spent on it for oregon schools should be used for food produced in oregon
is it really true that most of the food purchased for oregon schools under usda foods ended up with food from almost anywhere but oregon to answer you have to dive into federal rules governing usda foods and some of the department s school food programs
but for usda foods the one definitive document we found shows unambiguous results percent of food served in oregon schools and purchased with federal dollars came from another state
