Says U.S. Senate rival Tommy Thompson ran Medicare "into the ground" and "nine years closer to bankruptcy."
tammy baldwin says senate rival tommy thompson ran medicare into the ground as health and human services secretary
baldwin said thompson ran medicare into the ground during his four years as health and human services secretary citing the fact that its key trust fund moved nine years closer to insolvency
when tommy thompson left wisconsin in to join the bush administration he ran medicare
that s pretty tough stuff especially the thrust of baldwin s accusation that thompson was personally responsible for pushing medicare closer to bankruptcy
when he came to the administration medicare was approaching bankruptcy in the year when he left it was nine years closer to bankruptcy
