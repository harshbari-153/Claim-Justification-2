"Gonzalesâ€™ losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than $1 million from supporters and allies of Governor Bruce Rauner."
madigan said gonzales losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than million from supporters and allies of governor bruce rauner
in response to the lawsuit madigan issued a statement calling gonzales claims without merit but one sentence in particular stood out gonzales losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than million from supporters and allies of governor bruce rauner
while it s no secret gonzales was backed by republicans and supporters of rauner madigan s biggest political foe is it true his campaign was funded with more than million from them
indeed gonzales campaign received big donations from people who also gave to rauner s campaign fund but the speaker implies that every donation came from individuals and groups aligned with the governor
we found some of the top contributors to gonzales campaign fund also have donated to rauner and some top contributors to gonzales also have donated to other democrats
