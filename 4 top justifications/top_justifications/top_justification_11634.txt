Says President Trump’s mother said, "Yes, he’s an idiot with zero common sense, and no social skills, but he is my son. I just hope he never goes into politics. He’d be a disaster."
no evidence trump s mother called him an idiot with zero common sense
this does not appear to be a legitimate quote from president trump s mother
yes he s an idiot with zero common sense and no social skills but he is my son
i just hope he never goes into politics
mary anne trump passed away in and if she had said such an inflammatory statement about her son it would have likely come up in the news cycle during his presidential campaign
