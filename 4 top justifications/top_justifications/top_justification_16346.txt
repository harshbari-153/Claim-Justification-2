The stimulus program "cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people."
bill clinton says barack obama cut taxes for percent of people through stimulus
here s why the stimulus included tax cuts for many americans including a broad cut known as making work pay intended to offset payroll taxes which are automatically taken out of most workers paychecks and are not refundable
the recovery act saved or created millions of jobs and cut taxes let me say this again cut taxes for percent of the american people
percent of tax filers would receive a tax cut under obama plan based on the tax credit to offset payroll taxes
however clinton left out an important qualifier it s a tax cut for percent of working families
