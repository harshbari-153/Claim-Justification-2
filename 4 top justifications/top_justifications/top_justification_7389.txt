Kasim Reed has kept every promise he made as a candidate.
he s kept every promise he made as a candidate including the city s recreation centers reforming the city s pension plan standing up a force of police officers and not raising property taxes the release claimed
reed s promise was based on the tab of nearly million she said
so would accepting those explanations mean giving reed too much leeway to keep his promises
so while there is a window for promises we may not know reed made when he ran for office the pledges big and small appear at least in process if not done
but those pledges have been kept
