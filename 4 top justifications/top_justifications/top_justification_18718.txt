Says of a failed cloture vote on nominating Chuck Hagel for defense secretary: "This is not a filibuster."
our ruling cornyn said the failed cloture vote on hagel was not a filibuster
binder said she thought cloture vote on the hagel nomination was a filibuster the gop actions against hagel constitute a filibuster because the majority has been prevented from getting to a vote on confirmation
but in our review of the news coverage of the hagel nomination and recent reports on the filibuster we can t help but note that filibuster has come to have a distinctly negative connotation synonymous with political obstruction
yes it s a filibuster several experts we spoke with said the failed cloture vote does constitute a filibuster
this is not a filibuster sen
