"Wages adjusted for inflation havenâ€™t risen since the turn of the last century."
clinton said that wages adjusted for inflation haven t risen since the turn of the last century
this shows that wages didn t rise very much above inflation over that period though they did rise
i have made very clear that families need a raise not a tax increase she said adding that wages adjusted for inflation haven t risen since the turn of the last century
workers real wages that is after inflation is taken into account have been flat or even falling for decades regardless of whether the economy has been adding or subtracting jobs
they didn t rise by much roughly half a percentage point per year above inflation over the past decade and a half but they did rise
