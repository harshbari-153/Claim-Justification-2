Dan Webster "would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child."
the one we check now is the claim that webster would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker child
fact webster would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker child
alan grayson says dan webster would force rape and incest victims to bear their attacker child
by charging that webster would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker child the ad steps beyond the realm of a candidate personal belief and into the realm of what they would actually do if elected to office
but does that mean that webster would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker child we do think that so since webster legislative efforts on abortion while extensive have stopped well short of what grayson ad suggests
