"The fact is" the Clinton Foundation has "got about 80 percent in overhead and 20 percent of the money is actually getting into the places it should."
priebus said the fact is the clinton foundation has got about percent in overhead and percent of the money is actually getting into the places it should
i mean the fact is is if they ve got about percent overhead and percent of the money actually getting into the place that it should then it seems like the only work that the clinton foundation is doing is lining the pockets of bill and hillary clinton
it has given the clinton foundation an a rating and says it spends only percent of the money it raises on overhead
failure to understand the difference led to the widespread claim covered by the new york post rush limbaugh fox news and others that only a small portion of clinton foundation spending goes toward charity
reince priebus false claim that of clinton foundation costs are overhead
