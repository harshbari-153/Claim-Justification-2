here s her grievance in detail earl blumenauer is the sponsor of to mandate gps tracking devices on all our vehicles
delia lopez says earl blumenauer is trying to track americans by putting gps in all cars
a reading of the actual bill shows that rather than install gps tracking devices into all cars nationwide blumenauer is looking to set up a national pilot program that would test alternative ways of taxing road use
but as blumenauer spokesman willie smith points out gps is just one way to go about this and in fact there s no stipulation in the bill that gps which isn t even mentioned in the legislation be a part of the trial program
