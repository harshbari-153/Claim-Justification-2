A 1993 example of voter fraud in Philadelphia is "exactly what happened to us" in the 2020 election.
trump tweeted that a example of voter fraud in philadelphia is exactly what happened to us in the election
invoked an old case of voter fraud perpetrated by philadelphia democrats that altered the result of a state senate election
but nothing like what happened nearly three decades ago occurred during the election in philadelphia or anywhere else
the case at the heart of trump s tweet involved a rare verified case of voter fraud
election contains even one allegation let alone evidence of a single vote being cast illegally because of fraud
