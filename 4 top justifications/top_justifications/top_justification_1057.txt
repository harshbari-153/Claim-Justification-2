John McCain "began his career in Washington as a lobbyist when he was appointed in 1976 as the Navy's liaison to the United States Senate."
mccain started out as a lobbyist in washington when in he was the liaison for the navy to the united states senate
sanders told the ap that mccain began his career in washington as a lobbyist when he was appointed in as the navy liaison to the united states senate
so the question before us is whether someone holding the position of navy liaison as mccain did for several years in the should be considered a lobbyist
hayworth claims mccain was a lobbyist too for the navy
even if mccain was in some informal sense a lobbyist for the navy the position he held diverges in significant ways from the popular perception of lobbyists
