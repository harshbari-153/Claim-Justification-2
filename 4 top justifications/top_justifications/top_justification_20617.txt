Says Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and wife Sophie faked their COVID-19 vaccinations on live television.
a video recorded by a woman describing herself as a registered nurse claims that justin and sophie trudeau faked their vaccinations
but a woman claiming to be a registered nurse said the trudeaus shots were fake
in a video shared across facebook and on rumble the woman offered several reasons that the trudeaus shots were obviously fake including that the worker administering the shots used only one hand
canadian prime minister justin trudeau and his wife sophie took their first doses of the astrazeneca vaccine on april at a rexall pharmacy on live television
the video with the trudeaus is not a demonstration of the technique we use to train pharmacy personnel for immunizations but it also does not necessarily disprove that the trudeaus were vaccinated a spokesperson for the american pharmacists association told politifact
