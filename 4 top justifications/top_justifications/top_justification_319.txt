according to the text of the facebook post one of fauci most incredible emails is the one in which he advises a family member to use hydroxychlorichin sic and antibiotic therapy the same evening in which in a press conference he attacked president donald trump on the usefulness of hydroxychlorichin sic to fight the virus
hydroxychloroquine was specifically mentioned almost times in fauci s emails usually due to someone asking fauci for his thoughts on the drug
to the contrary fauci in his emails was consistent in arguing both publicly and privately that anecdotal evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine s efficacy in the pandemic would need to be demonstrated in a controlled clinical trial before its use could be recommended
on april nih press staff sent fauci an email seeking to finalize language for a press release that said in his name although there is anecdotal evidence that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may benefit people with we need solid data from a large randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes
