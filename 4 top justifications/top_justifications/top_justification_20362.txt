Cook Countyâ€™s criminal courts "have been shut down for 15 months."
lightfoot said cook county s criminal courts have been shut down for months
no cook county criminal courts haven t been shut down for months
our criminal courts have been shut down for months lightfoot continued echoing similar claims she has made about the cook county circuit court in recent months while defending the city s efforts to combat the wave of murders and shootings
in april she said the county had gone months without criminal trials and again in june she said the courts had been relatively inactive and closed for criminal trials since march
it is disingenuous for anyone to say that the courts have been closed
