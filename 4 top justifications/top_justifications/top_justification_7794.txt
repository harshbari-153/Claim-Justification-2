why was it a crime for nixon to wiretap the democrats at watergate but ok for obama to wiretap republicans at trump tower says the may facebook post
plus historians told us that while nixon tried to cover up the watergate there s no conclusive evidence that he actually ordered the wiretapping to take place
there is no good evidence that nixon knew about the watergate before the burglars got caught nor is there any good evidence that he knew that anyone from his reelection campaign was planning to bug democratic headquarters said ken hughes a historian at the university of virginia s miller center and an expert on nixon s recordings
whether he authorized the and illegal wiretap is unknown greenberg said adding that regardless of whether nixon knew no one disputes that it was an illegal wiretap
