"More people in this country have seen UFOs than I think approve of George Bush's presidency."
kucinich would have been accurate if he had said more people believe in ufos than approve of bush presidency
kucinich also had the snappy retort to russert playfulness more people in this country have seen ufos than i think approve of george bush presidency
the poll found percent said they had seen a ufo themselves and percent said they believed in ufos
we take the percent of the people at their word that they did indeed see strange flying objects with no everyday explanation
kucinich did say he believed in aliens but he confirmed that he did see a mysterious light in the sky an unidentified flying object
