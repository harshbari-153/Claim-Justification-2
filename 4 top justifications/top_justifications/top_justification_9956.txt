"As mayor, [Allan Fung] raised taxes three times."
he has repeatedly acknowledged that he raised taxes three times during his six years in office
a new ad titled allan fung an insider insider by the american leadhership pac a political action committee that is focused on electing democrat gina raimondo asks what do we really know about allan fung the ad calls him a career politician and says as mayor he raised taxes three times
but because it leaves out the important context of the three years in which he did not raise taxes we rate it mostly true
american leadhership ad ignores the three years allan fung did raise taxes
so it not surprising that allan fung the republican mayor of cranston has come under attack for wait for it raising taxes
