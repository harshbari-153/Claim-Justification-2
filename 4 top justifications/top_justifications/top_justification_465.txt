"I think [a little] less than half of the people in our prisons are in there for less than a year. Â ... We have people who are check kiters and don't pay child support and we are locking them up in the state pen."
we started with the claim that a little less than half of the people in state prisons are incarcerated for a year
addressing the substance of the question more directly kasich offered this we have a system in ohio where i think a little less than half of the people in our prisons are in there for less than a year
and it s true there are inmates imprisoned for check kiting and failing to pay child support
we have people who are check kiters and do pay child support and we are locking them up in the state pen
kasich s statement ohio is locking up check kiters and people who don t pay child support has to be measured against the intake figure since these low level crimes do not carry long prison sentences
