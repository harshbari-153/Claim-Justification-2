"I left the city with $43 million in the bank."
he served as miami mayor from until he lost in and says that he left the city in good financial shape
ferre said that in the newsmax interview he was referring to the sum amount of money left in various accounts in the city of miami that make up cash in the bank
ferre said i going to bring the common sense that i used when the city of miami jumped from being a nothing type of city to being an important american city which is what it was when i left in and in those days i left the city of miami with million in the bank
that notable because these days the city is plagued with budget shortfalls and under a federal investigation about its finances
i accept i probably made a mistake when i said million i think i meant million
