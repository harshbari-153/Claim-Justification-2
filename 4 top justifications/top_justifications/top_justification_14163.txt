It's illegal for a college, public school or employer to "mandate" the vaccine because it was authorized for emergency use.
a viral facebook post claims it is illegal for schools and employers to mandate vaccination against citing the vaccines emergency use authorization status
no it s not illegal for a college or employer to require a covid vaccine
if any college public school employer etc tries to mandate the latest prick it s completely illegal for them to do so the april post reads
there are no legal or legislative mechanisms that broadly prohibit employers or schools from mandating vaccinations
vaccine mandates in the workplace are such a requirement and have been used for a long time for example to require influenza vaccines for health care providers
