In the Senate version of the health reform bill, "Every enrollee in the Office of Personnel Management enrolled plan, every enrollee has to pay a minimum of $1 per month towards reproductive rights, which includes abortion."
stupak says every enrollee in the office of personnel management plan would have to to pay a minimum of per month towards abortion
the bill that they using as the vehicle is the senate bill and if you go to page through page you will find in there the federal government would directly subsidize abortions plus every enrollee in the office of personnel management enrolled plan every enrollee has to pay a minimum of per month towards reproductive rights which includes abortions stupak said in a good morning america interview with abc george stephanopoulos on march
in order to accomplish that the senate bill requires that all enrollees in plans that offer abortion services without regard to the enrollee s age sex or family status pay a separate amount to cover the actuarial value of abortion services for the entire population covered by the plan
in fact the senate bill requires that with respect to qualified health plans offered in an exchange there is at least one such plan that does not provide coverage of abortion services
but stupak misspoke when he said repeatedly that every enrollee would have to pay into an account that would pay for abortions
