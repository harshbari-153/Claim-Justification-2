My 2018 election was the first time Speaker Robin Vos has lost a Republican-held seat
this is the first time speaker vos has lost a seat and so he wants it back
yes because of gerrymandering only one republican assembly seat has flipped democratic since
i m the only democrat to beat the speaker vining said discussing her campaign
republicans held seats after the election picked up one in the election then dropped back to with vining s victory in
vining said her victory in was the first seat to flip from republican to democrat since vos took over the assembly in
