Hobby Lobby’s CEO wrote a letter saying the company’s stores may close.
but more importantly the posts wrongly claim that green said hobby lobby stores may close
in one facebook post from april for example the statement is titled hobby lobby we may close
no hobby lobby s ceo didn t say stores are closing
in the end the hobby lobby case went to the supreme court and in a decision in the company prevailed
green s column made no mention of hobby lobby closing
