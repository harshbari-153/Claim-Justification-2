On Gov. Tony "Evers’ watch…the efficiency of the state crime lab has plummeted."
on evers efficiency of the state crime lab has plummeted
has efficiency fallen dramatically at the crime lab and if so is evers to blame
the state republican party claimed that on evers efficiency of the state crime lab has plummeted
gov evers didn t cause slowdown of state crime labs
for our purposes here it all just underlines the fact evers does not oversee the crime lab so putting all the blame on him for declines in efficiency is misplaced
