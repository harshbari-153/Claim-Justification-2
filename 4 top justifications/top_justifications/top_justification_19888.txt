"If they made no changes whatsoever, the [state employees pension] plan still had enough money to go forward for approximately the next 16 years."
our ruling philip keefe said that if no changes were made to the state pension plan the plan still had enough money to go forward for approximately the next years
if they made no changes whatsoever the plan still had enough money to go forward for approximately the next years
but we were interested in whether the state employee pension plan is destined to run dry in years around the year
it predicts that the pension fund will run dry and all the money that current employees had paid into their retirement system would be lost in years in if the system remained unchanged and the state investments earned percent years in if the state investments earned percent years in if the pension fund were frozen for existing employees and retirees new workers were excluded and the rate of return was percent
so what would happen if the fund ran out of money the state is legally obligated to pay pension benefits
