Says Tim Tebow wrote, "The government might be preparing us for a cashless society, but it was predicted by the Bible."
the words attributed to the heisman trophy winner begin the government might be preparing us for a cashless society but it was predicted by the bible
some people believe that the bible does predict a cashless society as the facebook post says
no tim tebow didn t write this about a cashless society
we re judging whether this post is accurately attributed to tebow and we rate claims that he authored it falsetebow s facebook page which regularly refers to god and quotes from the bible has no trace of such a statement
