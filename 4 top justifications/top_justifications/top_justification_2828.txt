"The governorâ€™s cuts would kick over 8,000 people out of their homes."
the letter said the governor s cuts would kick over people out of their homes
quade and merideth said that the governor s cuts would cause people to lose their homes
but is the governor solely responsible for this outcome and people losing funding seems plausible but physically kicked out of house and home after talking to the chief of the public information office at the missouri department of health and senior services we found the representatives claim is not actually the case
while legislators could have considered other methods of funding the cuts to the budget ultimately fall on the shoulders of the governor and a significant number of people will lose funding for care as a result of them
the numbers suggest that just about people will lose their funding when the budget cuts go into effect but that doesn t mean these people will lose their homes
