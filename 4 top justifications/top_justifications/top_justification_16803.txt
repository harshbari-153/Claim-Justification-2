Says Barack Obama "supported Ted Kennedyâ€™s ammo ban to outlaw all deer-hunting ammunition."
the nra says barack obama supported ted kennedy s ammo ban to outlaw all ammunition
obama supported ted kennedy s ammo ban to outlaw all ammunition
to be clear kennedy wasn t proposing to outlaw ammunition and so it s even a bigger stretch to say obama supported it
in its attack the nra using the same evidence claimed obama wanted to ban virtually all deer hunting ammunition arguing that many bullets designed and intended for use in rifles including hunting rifles have over the years been used in hunting and target handguns thus they may be used in a handgun
it s entirely possible obama voted for kennedy s amendment and still would have opposed a ban on ammunition
