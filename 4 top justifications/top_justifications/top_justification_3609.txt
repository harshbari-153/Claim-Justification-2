"The Massachusetts Supreme Court...defined marriage as simply, quote,Â the establishment of intimacy ... I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse, I guess you could marry your horse."
you see the massachusetts supreme court when it started this move toward marriage actually defined marriage now get this it defined marriage as simply quote the establishment of intimacy hayworth said
the massachusetts supreme court did not define marriage simply as quote the establishment of intimacy
hayworth as we went back and reviewed that document back when the argument was made the high court in massachusetts defined marriage in a rather amorphous fashion simply as quote the establishment of intimacy
what you said about the establishment of intimacy being the definition of marriage in massachusetts i do think it true sir
maddow the establishment of intimacy as the definition of marriage it just not there let alone the horse thing
