Says Donald Trump said he believes suicide bombers deserve the death penalty.
did president trump really say that he thinks suicide bombers should get the death penalty
the full post reads donald trump just said he thinks suicide bombers should get the death penalty think about it take all the time you need
no trump did not say that suicide bombers deserve the death penalty
no trump never said he thinks suicide bombers should be sentenced to death
in the old satirical story president trump apparently made the suggestion with no time or place identified that anyone who terrorizes and kills good people by suicide bombing deserves nothing less than the highest penalty which is to pay with their life and if you detonate yourself with high explosives in the united states i will make you regret it
