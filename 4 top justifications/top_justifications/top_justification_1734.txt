The 2005 round of military base closings "has not yet resulted in savings."
we can not forget that the brac round has not yet resulted in savings he stated in an april news release
hasn t yet pocketed net savings from the realignment
wittman said that the brac round has not resulted in savings
the last realignment round was different from the four that came in the and harrison said because it focused much more heavily on base consolidations than previous rounds that were mostly directed at merely shuttering facilities
in short the round took place during a period of growth in the military and it reflected the goals and needs of that time
