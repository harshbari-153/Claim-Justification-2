Says Hillary Clinton's Iran nuclear deal "lined the pockets of the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money."
priebus said clinton iran nuclear deal lined the pockets of the world number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money
iran nuclear deal was hillary clinton and it the pockets of iran with americans money
just look just look at her disastrous iran nuclear deal which lined the pockets of the world s number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money while abandoning our greatest ally in the middle east the nation of israel
so the nuclear deal arguably lined the pockets of iran but almost all of it is iran s own money
the united states labels iran as the top state sponsor of terrorism
