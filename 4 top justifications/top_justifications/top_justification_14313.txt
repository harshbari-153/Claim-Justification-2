Sen. Obama wants to "enact the single largest tax increase since the Second World War."
and the effect of obama policy on the economy would be that of a tax increase
at politifact we concluded as have others that it unfair to call obama plan a tax increase merely because it does change existing tax law to keep rates low
moreover obama proposal does not constitute a tax increase in the traditional sense since taxes would be lower under his plan than they would under current law
we think about it this way the reason taxes will increase is because of tax policy signed into law not by obama but by somebody else
more over the next years under obama plan than it would be if the government extended bush tax cuts
