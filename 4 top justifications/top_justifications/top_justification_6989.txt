"Steve Southerland did not pay his taxes in '05, '06, '07, '08 or '09."
then a states steve southerland did not pay his taxes in or
it not that southerland did pay his businesses property taxes
but our here is whether southerland did pay his taxes for five years
in fact southerland did pay his taxes until he ran for congress
the ad makes it seem like southerland thumbed his nose at the tax collector and then squared up on five years worth of taxes only after he decided to run for congress and that simply is not the case
