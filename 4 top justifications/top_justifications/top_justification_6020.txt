The United States "is not modernizing its nuclear weapons."
rubio said that the united states is not modernizing its nuclear weapons
marco rubio says the united states is not modernizing its nuclear weapons
we wanted to know whether rubio was correct that the united states isn t modernizing its nuclear weapons so we consulted with experts on u
then he said this about the country s nuclear stockpiles we are the only nation that is not modernizing its nuclear weapons
so any normal definition of modernize describes what the united states is doing with its nuclear weapons
