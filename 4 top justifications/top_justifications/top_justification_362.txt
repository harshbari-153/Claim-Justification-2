Masks have negative impacts on 68% of children.
the post says masks to reduce the spread of covid have major negative impacts on of children
no study did prove that masks have negative effects on of children
without standards on capturing data on how the children reacted and without a matched group of children who didn t wear masks there s no way to say that the masks caused the children s reactions
impairments caused by wearing the mask were reported by of the parents
the claim s source is a report out of germany based on online submissions of childrens reactions to wearing masks
