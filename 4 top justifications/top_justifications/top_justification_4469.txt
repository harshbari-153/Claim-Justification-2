"Kasichâ€™s trade deals cost Ohio thousands of jobs - 49,000 jobs to Mexico, 91,000 to China."
a strickland tv ad truth sticks to the theme with claims that have been posted on the campaign website kasich s trade deals cost ohio thousands of jobs jobs to mexico to china
the ad says voting for nafta which took effect in and eliminated most trade barriers between canada mexico and the united states cost the state jobs to mexico
ted strickland campaign has wavered from the message that his republican opponent john kasich cost ohio jobs when he was a congressman by supporting the north american free trade agreement and overseas trade deals especially with china
it says ohio jobs were lost to china because of kasich s vote in to normalize trade relations with china
labeling them as kasich s trade deals as does the ad is a stretch though
