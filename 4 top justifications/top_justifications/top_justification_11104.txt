"CNN's Crap Polling" is so bad that it shows that "no one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton."
the internet graphic accused cnn of being such an incompetent pollster that it found that no one under the age of has an opinion of hillary clinton
the creator of the image was dumbfounded slapping this comment on the image in big red type cnn crap polling no one under the age of has an opinion of hillary clinton
there one can find a heading that reads under with percent of respondents in that age group saying they feel favorably about clinton percent saying they feel unfavorably percent saying they have no opinion and percent saying they ve never heard of her
in other words for the age ranges to and to the survey reached too few people to produce a statistically valid sample so to avoid publishing questionable numbers cnn simply reported them as
so this column of poll results clearly shows that people under did tell the survey takers about their opinions about clinton
