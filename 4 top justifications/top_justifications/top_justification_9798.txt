On the Iraq war, "I said it loud and clear, 'You'll destabilize the Middle East.' "
on the iraq war trump said i said it loud and clear destabilize the middle east
but i said it and i said it loud and clear you destabilize the middle east
in this more recent version of the statement he also said he stated his opposition to the war loud and clear
but he did not say anything that resembles his claim that bush should not proceed because a war would destabilize the middle east
because he far overstated how loudly he declared his position on the iraq war we re cranking the rating on this statement up to false
