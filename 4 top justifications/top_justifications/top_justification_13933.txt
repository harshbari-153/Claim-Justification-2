"Most folks’ wages haven’t gone up in over a decade."
obama said most folks wages haven t gone up in over a decade
because the truth is and you know this in your own lives and you see it in your neighborhoods among your friends and family even though the economy has been growing for four years even though corporate profits have been doing very well stock prices have soared most folks wages have gone up in over a decade
we wondered even taking inflation into account is it true the majority of americans haven t seen their wages increase in more than years
they agreed that it s not possible to track the wages of actual individuals over a period of more than a decade and so it can t be known whether most of them had a higher wage in than in
it s not possible to know considering all americans whether most of them saw a wage increase in the period cited by the president
