State Rep. Elena Parent "supported Governor Nathan Dealâ€™s plan to slash the HOPE scholarship."
supported governor nathan deal s plan to slash the hope scholarship it said
to sum up williams said parent supported the governor s plan to slash the hope scholarship
in january nathan deal a republican took office as governor and shortly thereafter announced plans to revamp the state s popular hope scholarship program to prevent it from going broke
the williams campaign forwarded us two documents that show parent voted in favor of a bill deal and other republicans proposed to make changes to hope but those items did not include a key element
and to say parent supported a plan that she ultimately voted against seems to be a significant distortion of her record
