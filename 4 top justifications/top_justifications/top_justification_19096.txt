"Your ballot could be disqualified if it is written on" in Haltom City, Tex.
your ballot could be disqualified if it is written on
there an election official said poll workers don t have a reason to write on a ballot but it wouldn t be disqualified if they did
don t worry about texas poll workers writing on your ballot it s the law
please request a new ballot
neither the stamp or the signature or just an errant marking on the ballot will disqualify it garcia said
