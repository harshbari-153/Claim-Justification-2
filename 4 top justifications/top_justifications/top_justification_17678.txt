"Americans will spend more on taxes in 2014 than they will on food, clothing and housing combined."
the tax foundation post said that americans will spend more on taxes in than they will on food clothing and housing combined
americans will spend more on taxes in than they will on food clothing and housing combined the post said and it included a chart showing that the combination of state local and federal taxes exceeded the amount spent on food clothing and housing
do americans pay more in taxes than in food clothing and housing
the claim sounded familiar to us in we checked a statement by republican national committee chairman reince priebus that americans will pay more in taxes in than they will spend on groceries clothing and shelter combined
while the tax foundation s method shows that americans as a whole pay more for taxes than for food clothing and shelter there are wide variations in what individual americans pay
