farmers stand in silence at auction so a young man can buy back his family farmhouse reads the text beneath the photo
a facebook post claimed that a picture of a crowd depicted farmers standing in silence at auction so a young man can buy back his family farmhouse
when the auction actually took place some different farmers were at the auction and david and his father thought they would never be able to afford to buy it back the blog post said
the story shared on the travel blog went like this an unidentified relative of a man named david sold an family farm and david and his father set out to buy the farm back when it went to auction
in that blog post the story lacks specific biographical details such as when this supposedly happened the last name of the farmer involved or the location of the auction or the farmhouse
