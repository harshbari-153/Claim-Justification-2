Says proposal to use city-owned land for an Austin pro soccer stadium is a "$1 billion giveaway."
is claim that austin soccer plan is a billion giveaway on target or worth a red card
the group which initially answered questions from politifact texas through but didn t respond to a request for a phone interview said it arrived at the billion giveaway figure by first calculating the estimated property taxes that would be owed by precourt if it owned the land instead of leasing it from the city and also made million worth of improvements on it which the group pegged as the value of the soccer stadium
setting aside that no formal proposals exist to spend billion on any of those items we were curious whether it s accurate to say the city council will be handing such an amount to a private company and getting nothing in return if it approves the agreement for the soccer stadium as it currently is formulated
precourt a major league soccer team owner would then privately finance and build what it has estimated would be a million stadium at the site
the political action committee making the claim of a billion giveaway called austin for a better future drives home the enormity of the sum in an internet video by conjuring a wish list of alternative uses for the money
