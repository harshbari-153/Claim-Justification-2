"No city in the state can quarantine itself without state approval."
no city in the state can quarantine itself without state approval and i have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to quarantine any city
cuomo said that cities do not have the power to order quarantines without state approval
cuomo correctly says no quarantine without state approval
we wondered if a city or a county could unilaterally order its residents into isolation whether by ordering a quarantine or or if cuomo is right in his claim that only the state can do that
we hear new york city is going to quarantine itself
