Says Mitt Romney "wants to end tax credits for wind producers."
our ruling barack obama said mitt romney plans to put an end to tax credits that benefit the wind power industry
obama says romney would end wind power tax credits
but the industry is fragile and obama played to that when he said at a moment when homegrown energy is creating new jobs in states like colorado and iowa my opponent wants to end tax credits for wind producers
it worth noting that romney position on the tax breaks for wind energy is a major issue within the wind power industry
obama was referring to renewable energy production tax credits
