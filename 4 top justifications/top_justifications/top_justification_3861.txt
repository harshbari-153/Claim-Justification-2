The health care law includes tort reform.
tort reform in the health care law no
but we stopped short at weiner claim that the health care law included tort reform
did it before we get into details of the health care law we should explain the basics of tort reform in plain language
what tort reform usually means is changing the rules that apply when patients sue their doctors for medical errors or malpractice
but in claiming that the law includes tort reform he is significantly mischaracterizing the law
