Says iPads and iPhones "are built in the United States of America."
john mccain errs in saying ipads iphones are made in the usa
but mccain was wrong to suggest that ipads and iphones are built in the united states of america
mccain is aware the iphone ipad and other apple products were designed in the united states but manufactured elsewhere said buchanan
the answer is inscribed on the back of every iphone designed by apple in california
but i would also point out that if you emptied a house shown in the earlier segment if you left a computer there or an ipad or an iphone those are built in the united states of america
