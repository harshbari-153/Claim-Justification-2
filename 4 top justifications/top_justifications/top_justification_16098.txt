that s right the biden administration has decided to cancel in student debt
a widely shared social media post claimed the biden administration has decided to cancel in student debt

less than a month after biden took office a widely shared facebook post claimed that biden really did wipe away student loan debt
the tweet was followed by another stating that biden took student loan cancellation out of his budget because congress wo pass it an apparent reference to the difficulty of getting republican support for such legislation in the senate
