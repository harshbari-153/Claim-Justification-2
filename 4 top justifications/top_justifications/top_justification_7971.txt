"The Christian Coalition gave (Adam) Hasner an F."
the christian coalition gave hasner an f
george lemieux says adam hasner got an f from christian coalition
so what happened that year the christian coalition gave hasner an f for voting in favor of a slew of gambling measures that the coalition opposed
the lemieux video correctly states that hasner received an f from the christian coalition
also the video statement about the christian coalition grade is preceded by claims about hasner stances on stem cell research abortion and school vouchers and it could create a false impression that those are the reasons the christian coalition gave him an f
