palin said the health care law changes a sensible health care program
it sounds like previous claims made by the law opponents namely that obamacare puts the government between americans and their doctors
instead the american medical association the largest doctor advocacy group in the country has been supportive of the law
there will be fewer people being covered under a sensible health care program under obamacare than what we see today she said
the vice presidential candidate brought us death panels our lie of the year and helped circulate the inaccurate statement that the affordable care act is health care
