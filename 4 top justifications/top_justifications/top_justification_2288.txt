"Amy, I looked online at your (health care) plan. Itâ€™s two paragraphs."
warren said amy i looked online at your health care plan
amy i looked online at your plan
the problem with warren s attack is that it focuses on two paragraphs which ignores most of her rival s health care plan
elizabeth warren wrong to say amy klobuchar s health plan is just two paragraphs long
it two paragraphs
