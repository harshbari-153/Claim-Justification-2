"In Congress, (Cresent Hardy) voted to defund DACA."
kihuen said hardy voted to defund daca while in congress
hardy did vote for a version of a bill that included an amendment defunding daca
in congress he voted to defund daca kihuen said
so is kihuen right to say that hardy voted to get rid of daca the answer really depends on which vote is highlighted the republican technically voted for a version of the funding bill that included language defunding the program but he voted against that amendment in particular and went against the majority of house republicans to vote for the clean version of the legislation
hardy and the other nevada house republicans voted in favor of the final funding bill that included the amendment defunding daca
