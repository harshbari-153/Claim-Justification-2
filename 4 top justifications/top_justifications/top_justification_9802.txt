"People are less likely to just vote for party now. … They’re looking at the personalities."
vining said people are less likely to just vote for party now
and broadly speaking party is playing a growing role in voters decisions not a shrinking one
they re looking at the personalities
in a year and an election that has been polarized at every turn are voters focusing more on party or personality
voters choosing more on party than personality but trump is the exception for some
