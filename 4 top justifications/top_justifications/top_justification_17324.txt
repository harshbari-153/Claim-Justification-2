House Democrats have kicked Rep. Ilhan Omar out of Congress
a facebook video said that house democrats kicked omar out of congress
the headline and caption appearing with a video on a june facebook post reads finally house democrats kicks ilhan omar from congress
while house democrats have expelled members of their own party on a few occasions there has been no effort to oust omar
the video shared in the post however shows not house democrats but state republican legislators speaking about omar at a news conference
ilhan omar is facing a primary challenge but she s still a member of congress
