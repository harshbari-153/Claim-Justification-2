Says Mitt Romney is wrong to claim that spending under Obama has "accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history," because it's actually risen "slower than at any time in nearly 60 years."
our ruling the facebook post says mitt romney is wrong to claim that spending under obama has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history because it actually risen slower than at any time in nearly years
we examined at a facebook post that said mitt romney is wrong to claim that spending under obama has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history because it actually risen slower than at any time in nearly years
meanwhile we would ve given a true rating to the facebook claim that romney is wrong to say that spending under obama has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history
so the second portion of the facebook claim that obama s spending has risen slower than at any time in nearly years strikes us as half true
under the heading romney s world the facebook post quoted a romney web page saying since president obama assumed office three years ago federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history
