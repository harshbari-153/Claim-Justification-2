Says wearing masks has been "proven ineffective."
is schraa correct when he claims that wearing masks has been proven ineffective
in a critique of local governments ability to require people to wear masks schraa said that masks are proven ineffective at cutting down transmission of the coronavirus
but schraa did say here and in other forums that he believed masks weren t effective
what about the other way around do masks protect you from others for cloth mask wearers research is less clear on this front but evidence is growing here too
it s important to note that at one point federal health officials were not recommending that everyone wear masks although the centers for disease control and prevention began advising widespread mask use in april and hasn t changed its stance since
