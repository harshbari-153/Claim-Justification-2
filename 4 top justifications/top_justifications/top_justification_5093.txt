Say Gretchen Carlson said, "The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented."
it was headlined gretchen carlson the amendment was written before guns were invented
no gretchen carlson did say amendment written before guns invented
don t you know the amendment was written before guns were even invented
bottom line carlson did not say the amendment was written before guns were invented
indeed the history of firearms goes back even further than that to the more than four centuries before the second amendment was written
