"A (state) trooper with 10 years on the force is getting $500 a year more than a trooper with 10 minutes on the force."
garrett said trooper with years on the force is getting a year more than a trooper with minutes on the force
what grabbed our attention here is that a veteran state trooper with a decade of service gets a mere more than a newly badged trooper
a trooper with years on the force is getting a year more than a trooper with minutes on the force and yet they somehow found money to waste on tents for our state parks
so a trooper with years on the force would make almost percent more than a rookie
altogether that means a trooper who has been on the force a decade would earn more than a rookie
