By allowing brewpubs to sell beer, Georgia could become like Mexico with only a couple of manufacturers controlling all aspects of market.
i referenced mexico as an example of a country where producers are allowed to directly control the retail market and thus two producers control percent of the beer market which essentially blocks out all new small craft producers
first a little background about this country craft brewing as well as the mexico beer market
politifact georgia wondered was smith right to suggest that allowing brew pubs to sell beer for consumption would set the stage for a tightly controlled beer market on par with mexico s we decided to take a deeper look
a vast majority of states have allowed breweries and brew pubs to sell directly to their consumers in a segment of the beer market that is flourishing
the criticism of the mexican beer market for years was that it effectively had largely two players and a duopoly modelo owned by inbev and femsa owned by heineken
