Says he never called teachers "thugs" and has said nothing but "great things" about them during the fight over his curbs on unions
our conclusion at the nbc education summit walker denied saying teachers are thugs and said he s only said great thing about teachers
so is walker right on the thugs comment and that he only had positive things to say about teachers first teachers are thugs
but walker spokesman cullen werwie said the governor was not talking about teachers when he denounced thuggery attacks
but did scott walker say teachers are thugs certainly not in the sharp way that new jersey gov
so walker can accurately claim he has avoided direct rhetorical attacks on teachers as a profession
