Candidates who are supporting the Green New Deal are "promoting abortion in third world countries to control the population!"
haley said in an email that targets defeat of the green new deal that candidates who are supporting the proposal are promoting abortion in third world countries to control the population
the candidates touted everything from putting limits on red meat consumption to promoting abortion in third world countries to control the population
the email then links to a petition that seeks to stop the green new deal saying it would promote abortion
the words abortion and population are not mentioned in the text of the green new deal resolution
green new deal does mention abortion but nikki haley attack on it does
