"Zack Nunn saved over 2,000 Americans abandoned in Afghanistan by leading private rescue missions."
zack nunn saved over americans abandoned in afghanistan by leading private rescue missions a video ad for nunn states
a political ad for nunn s congressional district primary race in iowa says nunn saved over americans abandoned in afghanistan by leading private rescue missions
nunn said in the politifact iowa interviews he was involved with rescue missions via third party countries that helped remove americans and afghans from afghanistan last year
our research shows the ad overshoots how many americans he personally led out of afghanistan but that some americans in afghanistan still are being helped by nunn and task force argo
nunn is doing humanitarian work but the number in the ad is an exaggeration and ignores important details
