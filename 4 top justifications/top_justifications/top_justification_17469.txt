cnn did a poll recently where obama and i are statistically tied
the network quickly posted a story headlined trump cites cnn poll but cnn did conduct such a poll

obama trump a couple of notes rasmussen and public policy polling use methods which many polling experts consider less reliable than polls conducted by human operators
