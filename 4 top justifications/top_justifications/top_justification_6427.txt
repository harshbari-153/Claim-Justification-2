brought out a favorite talking point ways the president can bring down drug prices without waiting for congress
we focused on warren s argument that the president already has this legal authority for many drugs and that the power stems from section and the rights provision of a law
he pointed out that the president would have to nominate a candidate for secretary get that person confirmed then have the secretary make this order in respect to specific drugs certify that the drugs are safe and would result in cost reduction then have the importation take place
