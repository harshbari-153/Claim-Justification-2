"If you look at windmills" and the greenhouse gas emissions from building to retiring them, "the overall return is negative."
bremer said once you factor in the emissions that come from building and putting up a windmill you end up with a net negative
is it true that in terms of greenhouse gas emissions the lifetime return on wind turbines is negative we reached out to bremer s campaign to see what experts he relied on and we didn t hear back
in terms of carbon footprint a wind turbine produces about times less greenhouse gases than a natural plant
there are two ways to look at the emissions of windmills and we ll consider both
if you look at windmills there s a lot of greenhouse gas emission cost that we gloss over bremer said in a fox news interview march
