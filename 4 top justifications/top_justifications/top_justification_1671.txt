"It’s illegal for a state to say we’re simply going to cut off (union contract) negotiations. There’s a legal requirement that you are involved in good faith bargaining."
said doyle it s illegal for a state to say we re simply going to cut off negotiations
there s a legal requirement that you are involved in good faith bargaining
then there s that notoriously vague legal definition of good faith bargaining
as worded that suggests a unilateral move on the part of the state not a request to seek the consent of unions to hit the pause button
but let s come back to the legal question in making his claim doyle asserts that it would be unlawful for him to suspend bargaining with the state s labor unions
