"The president’s own advisers have said there’s a war on coal."
the president s own advisers have said there s a war on coal
mcconnell said the president s own advisers have said there s a war on coal
we decided to look at the substance behind mcconnell s claim that the president s own advisers have said there s a war on coal
it would be politically inflammatory if the president s team was talking about waging a war on coal
the adviser expressed support for that sort of policy but press accounts at the time and the adviser s own words today affirm that he did not say there is presently a war on coal
