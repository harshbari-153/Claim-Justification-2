"Weâ€™re the most highly taxed nation in the world."
trump said the united states is the most highly taxed nation in the world
donald trump says is highly taxed nation in the world
a reader asked us if the united states is the mostly highly taxed nation in the world so we decided to check it out
but trump comment does cite the corporate tax rate and he seemed to be discussing overall tax rates when he said the united states is the most highly taxed nation in the world
we have given a mostly true rating to the claim that the united states has the highest corporate tax rate in the world
