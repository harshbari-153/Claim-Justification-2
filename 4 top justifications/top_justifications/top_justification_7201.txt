"Breaking: Crew of Air Force One Refuses to Fly Obama 6000 miles ‘Just to Play Golf’ "
with the headline breaking crew of air force one refuses to fly obama miles just to play golf
the claims circulated on social media that air force one won t transport the obamas for vacation are flights of fancy
the article states that the captain of the fleet had enough with the obamas frivolous flights and wouldn t take the president to hawaii just for the day to play a round of golf with a friend
no air force one did not refuse to take obama to hawaii
the article s assertion that air force one is not obligated to fly anywhere unless it was on official business lacks critical context
