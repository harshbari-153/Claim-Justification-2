Says he "voted for disaster relief and full funding of FEMA."
tom voted for disaster relief and full funding of fema
a cotton for senate ad said tom voted for disaster relief and full funding of fema
we rated that claim half true noting that cotton had indeed voted against disaster relief spending five times but that he had also voted for disaster relief funding as long as there were spending cuts to other programs to make up for it
at least two of the votes cotton s ad cites and possibly all three show support for providing funding for disaster relief
the bill would have appropriated funding for fema
