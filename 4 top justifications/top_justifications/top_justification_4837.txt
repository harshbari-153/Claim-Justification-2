wentworth was the only republican to vote against the sonogram law requiring women to have a sonogram or listen to the fetal heartbeat hours before receiving an abortion
for this fact check we re isolating the claim closest to wentworth s recent record that he was the only republican to vote against the state s measure requiring women to have a sonogram before an abortion
we confirmed from news accounts that wentworth was the only one of republican senators to oppose the proposal requiring a woman seeking an abortion to have a sonogram at least hours before the procedure with the results made available to her
our ruling wentworth was the sole republican senator to vote against the sonogram measure
upshot wentworth was the only republican senator to oppose the sonogram mandate and was among very few republican legislators to do so
