right now the tea party polls higher than the republicans and the democrats
yes the tea party is viewed favorably by people who know about the group particularly those who get their news from fox but the pollsters who conducted the survey say it not accurate to say that the party is more popular than democrats or republicans
but some political analysts have questioned whether the poll exaggerated the tea party favorable ratings because the group is not well known and because of the heavy coverage it gets from fox news a conservative news outlet
also other polls contradict armey statement and indicate that democrats are more popular than tea party candidates
armey says tea party is more popular than democrats republicans
