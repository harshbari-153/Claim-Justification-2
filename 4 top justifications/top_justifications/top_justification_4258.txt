General Electric "hasn't really created any jobs in this country, doesn't Â pay any taxes, and they're making historic profits."
so how do we gauge kaptur s claim that general electric hasn t really created any jobs in this country using ge s own filings to shareholders kaptur is correct
pointing to what she thinks is an imbalance she cited the case of general electric which has really created any jobs in this country does pay any taxes and they making historic profits
her comments stood out because general electric s federal income taxes have been a matter of dispute
federal taxes last year because we did not owe any
but even with these upcoming gains ge will not employ as many people in the united states as it did in
