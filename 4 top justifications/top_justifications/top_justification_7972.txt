Says "tax revenues are the lowest they have been since World War II."
are tax revenues the lowest they been since world war ii
schrader says in his comment that revenue is the lowest since the end of world war ii
the first part is especially worth a look tax revenues are the lowest they have been since world war ii because that claim and some variation of it will be heard often when congress begins debating tax reform later this year
one big reason comprehensive tax reform is needed he wrote is tax revenues are the lowest they have been since world war ii and need to increase through comprehensive tax reform
he also fails to point out another important caveat that absolute levels of federal tax revenues collected in many of the most recent years have been at or near record levels even though the percentage remains low
