"Under Barack Obama the last two years, the number of federal limousines for bureaucrats has increased 73 percent."
i tell you one thing that should be on the table under barack obama the last two years the number of federal limousines for bureaucrats has increased percent in two years
percent increase in the number of federal limousines in the last two years for heaven sake
but bachmann claim that under barack obama the last two years the number of federal limousines for bureaucrats has increased percent is based on squishy figures from the gsa according to the gsa itself
she made a similar statement during an appearance in new hampshire on june in the last two years under the obama administration the number of federal limousines have increased percent under president obama
in other words limos used for law enforcement accounted for of the new limousines more than half the entire increase
