Says Dan McCready "believes in open borders and sanctuary cities."
trump tweeted that mccready believes in open borders and sanctuary cities
is it fair for trump to say mccready has supported open borders and sanctuary cities
but that doesn t mean mccready supports sanctuary cities said his spokesman matt fried
while mccready opposed a bill that would crack down on sanctuary policies that doesn t mean he supports sanctuary cities
mccready s position does not imply that he favors open borders though he would be open to a charge that his favored policies would not do enough to secure the borders schuck told politifact in an email
