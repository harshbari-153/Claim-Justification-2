California has "robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation."
he told them california has robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe according to a november press release from the senator s office
state senator kevin de león said earlier this month that california has robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe
another interpretation of de león s claim is that california s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states in the rest of the nation
that s significant because five other states had a faster job growth rate than california s percent last year
those states are part of the rest of the nation and would likely balk at the idea of california outpacing their job growth success
