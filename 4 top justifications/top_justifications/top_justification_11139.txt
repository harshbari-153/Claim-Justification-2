"We have my opponent Sam Olens to thank for [the Arizona immigration ruling] since he was on the team that got Clinton elected."
it is a verifiable fact that sam olens worked to get bill clinton elected which led to the appointment of activist judges such as judge bolton and others that strike down constitutionally sound politically popular legislation like the arizona law based on their personal views clemons wrote
these are smith words from a july news release it should be no surprise that judge bolton is a bill clinton appointee so in part we have my opponent sam olens to thank for nonsense like this since he was on the team that got clinton elected
clinton lost the county by a wide margin so we think it a major stretch to say we have sam olens to thank for clinton getting elected
so how did a politician from georgia play a role in a highly controversial legal case in arizona that has become a centerpiece in the battle over illegal immigration here is smith logic olens helped get bill clinton elected president in
during one debate smith said olens was part of the clinton campaign
