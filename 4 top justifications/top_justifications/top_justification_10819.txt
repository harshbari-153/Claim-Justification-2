"Seventy four thousand... Thatâ€™s how many mail-in ballots were recently found in Arizona that have NO clear record of being sent in."
that s how many ballots were recently found in arizona that have no clear record of being sent in reads the first line of the mailer sent tuesday
we have ballots where there is no clear record of their being sent
in a political fundraising mailer the texas gop perpetuated a voting fraud claim based on a partisan arizona election audit saying that ballots were recently found in arizona without a record of ever being sent
if the press and democrats do like the fact that ballots have either major clerical errors or potential fraudulent backgrounds they should be asking the arizona audit chief for more information spokesperson luke twombly said
the preliminary audit results also caught the attention of former president donald trump who issued a statement repeating the same finding it seems that ballots were counted with no clear record of them being sent
