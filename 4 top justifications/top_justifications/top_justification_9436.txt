Says the National Mall’s webcam was "abruptly shut down" and removed from the White House’s website to stop viewers from seeing the lack of attendees at president Trump’s Fourth of July event.
the webcam of the national mall was abruptly shut down without notice and has been removed from the whitehouse
now a social media post roaming around the internet claims that a photo of the national mall during trump s fourth of july salute to america ceremony shows how few people attended and asserts the webcam filming the celebration was purposely turned off because of it
the webcams on the national mall have all been turned off without notice so no one will talk about trump size
there is also no evidence to suggest that white house live feeds of the event were deliberately turned off to prevent viewers from seeing the crowd mainly because it s the national park service not the white house that controls webcams on the national mall
mike litterst chief of communications for the national park service told politifact that while the webcam overseeing the national mall is indeed offline it has been so since september
