"Because of Barack Obama 32 million new people will have healthcare."
our ruling the obama campaign ad said because of barack obama million new people will have healthcare
one of the claims that million new people will have health care
the numbers the obama campaign directed us to the congressional budget office which early on estimated that million americans would be covered by health insurance by under the sweeping health care reform passed by congress and signed by obama in
of course if you re obama you re going to campaign on the assumption that the health care law including the individual mandate will be upheld
many of those newly insured will be people who are added to medicaid perhaps million according to the cbo
