"Teachers are the number one occupation of the antifa terrorist organization according to the FBI."
in a july text post one facebook user wrote teachers are the number one occupation of the antifa terrorist organization according to the fbi
but has the fbi said the movement is popular with teachers
social media posts that claim teachers make up the bulk of antifa activists need to get schooled
we could find no publicly available records from the fbi or other intelligence agencies that link antifa to teachers
there is evidence that in general teachers political views skew left
