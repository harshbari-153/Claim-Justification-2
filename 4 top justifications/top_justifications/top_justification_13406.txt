"Women in our state will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care"
cuomo said women in new york state will continue to have access to reproductive health care because of an action the state took earlier this year
this year we ensured that whatever happens at the federal level women in our state will continue to have access to reproductive health care cuomo said in a statement
but not every woman is in an insurance plan regulated by the state
but cuomo said contraception will still be covered in new york state
million people in that category are covered by the state s birth control mandate
