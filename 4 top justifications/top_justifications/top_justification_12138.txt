President Obama has "the worst ratings of any president at the end of his first year."
rove says obama approval ratings after a year are worst of any president
first we should note that rove was guilty of rhetorical excess when he said that obama numbers are the worst of any president at this point
so rove should have argued that obama numbers were the worst of any war ii president at this point in his term
in a column headlined the president is no rove wrote that barack obama has won a place in history with the worst ratings of any president at the end of his first year percent approve and percent disapprove of his job performance in the latest usa poll
second rove misspoke when he referred to measuring obama ratings at the end of his first year
