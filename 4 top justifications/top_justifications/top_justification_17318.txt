"In the state legislature, I supported Second Amendment rights."
in a tv ad kander said in the state legislature i supported second amendment rights
what the supreme court says about the second amendment
he continues to say in the state legislature i supported second amendment rights while supporting background checks to keep guns like the out of the hands of terrorists
kander supported second amendment while in office
someone could believe in the second amendment but still support some restrictions on guns
