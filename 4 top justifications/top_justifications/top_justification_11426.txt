Says Brett Kavanaugh "has said the president shouldn't be investigated."
schumer said that kavanaugh has said the president should be investigated
noah feldman a harvard law professor wrote in a bloomberg column that while democrats argue that kavanaugh believes a president shouldn t be indicted while in office kavanaugh s expressed views actually support the opposite conclusion that the president can be investigated and maybe even indicted unless congress passes a law saying he can t which congress has not done
schumer is using that notion that in general it is bad policy to allow presidents to be pursued by prosecutors while in office to imply that kavanaugh thinks trump shouldn t be investigated and to question how he would rule as a judge said michigan state university law professor brian kalt
they have passed no such statute and it is not reasonable to suggest that kavanaugh as a judge would ignore that fact
but given that there is no law in place protecting the president and that ken starr issued subpoenas while kavanaugh was working for him my money would be on requiring trump to comply
