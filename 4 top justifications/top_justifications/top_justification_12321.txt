"Sixty-percent of the state retirees...don’t get Social Security.’’
rhode island aarp head kathleen connell says percent of state retirees don t get social security
the ruling connell was clearly wrong when she said that percent of state retirees don t get social security
as far as we could tell no single agency in rhode island knows the precise number of retirees in the state system who are covered by social security not even the state office of the general treasurer according to its spokeswoman joy fox
even if we added in another or so police and firefighters in pension plans almost all of whom don t get social security the overall percentage of those covered would still be percent
add all the numbers up and the share of retirees in the plans who do get social security is about percent
