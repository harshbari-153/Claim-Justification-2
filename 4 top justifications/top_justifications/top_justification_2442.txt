"Muslim figure: We must have pork-free menus or we will leave U.S."
a facebook post s headline says muslim figure we must have menus or we will leave u
a facebook post s headline says muslim figure we must have menus or we will leave u
the original story references a situation that happened in france not in the united states and it involved a mayor demanding that pork be kept on menus not muslims demanding that pork be removed from menus
the breitbart story did not mention any demands by muslims but its headline says the french mayor demanded pork in school lunches
old hoax about muslims demanding menus is still false
