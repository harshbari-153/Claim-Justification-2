"All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange."
the said all private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a healthcare exchange
but one of the claims is actually true all private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a healthcare exchange
health care exchange is government way of regulating insurers
the reason for the exchange is that the government wants to regulate insurers to make sure that health plans clearly explain what they offer ca refuse people for conditions and must offer basic levels of service
the bill envisions that everyone will be required to have health insurance
