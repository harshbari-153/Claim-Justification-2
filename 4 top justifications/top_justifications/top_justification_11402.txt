In the Florida Republican primary, "we got a very large percentage of the, quote, conservative vote."
we got a very large percentage of the quote conservative vote
but i am confident we are already seeing many of the conservatives and in the state of florida we carried florida in a primary
in south carolina where percent of those who participated in the republican primary consider themselves conservative mccain got percent of the vote compared to percent for huckabee and percent for romney
but as for mccain characterization that conservative support in florida was very large it too relative a concept to call it false
among republicans who described themselves as somewhat conservative percent voted for mccain better than romney percent
