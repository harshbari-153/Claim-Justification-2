"It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don't do this in an election year."
it has been years since a supreme court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year cruz said
cruz said there s a long tradition stretching back years of not nominating and confirming a supreme court justice in an election year
that it is a long tradition that a president in his final year in office should let his successor fill a spot on the nation s highest court
a supreme court justice hasn t been both nominated and confirmed in a presidential election year since years ago
but that s more because of the rarity of filling supreme court slots than some long tradition
