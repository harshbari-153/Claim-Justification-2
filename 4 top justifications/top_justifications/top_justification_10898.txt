The government must have planned the coronavirus pandemic because the coronavirus relief bill had been introduced three years earlier.
facebook posts said the government must have planned the coronavirus pandemic because the coronavirus relief bill had been introduced three years earlier
that s more than three years before the novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic which the post cites as evidence that the pandemic was a event
so there s nothing fishy about a coronavirus relief bill having been introduced prior to the pandemic s emergence
the coronavirus pandemic has generated a torrent of conspiracy theories
government somehow planned the pandemic
