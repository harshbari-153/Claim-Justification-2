"Queen Elizabeth and her husband Prince Philip were found guilty in the disappearance of 10 native children from the Catholic-run Kamloops residential school"
a facebook post claimed that queen elizabeth and her husband prince philip were found guilty in the disappearance of ten native children from the kamloops indian residential school
a facebook post falsely claims that queen elizabeth and prince philip have been found guilty for kidnapping native children
the july post is a rehash of a claim after nearly a year of litigation queen elizabeth and her husband prince philip were found guilty in the disappearance of native children from the kamloops residential school in british columbia
if the queen of england were found guilty in court of any crime it would be international news
but there is no evidence that queen elizabeth or prince philip had anything to do with the discovery or the school
