Says a poll showed 70 percent to 75 percent of people want to see Confederate statues "remain up and not taken down."
i saw a poll i think on npr or percent of the people would like to see those statues remain up and not taken down
miller said a poll showed percent to percent of people oppose the removal of confederate statues
its poll question do you favor or oppose removing statues and memorials of confederate leaders percent favored removals percent were opposed percent were unsure
the poll taken in collaboration with npr and the pbs newshour asked do you think statues honoring leaders of the confederacy should remain as a historical removed because they are offensive to some people percent of the surveyed adults said the statues should remain percent said they should be removed percent were unsure
percent so you could speculate that percent of the respondents wanted such statues to stay put
