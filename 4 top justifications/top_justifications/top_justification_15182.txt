"For people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going up about $5,000 because the fact is, they will pay more in new taxes" for Medicare for All.
for people making between and a year their taxes are going up about because the fact is they will pay more in new taxes biden said at the oct
so suggesting that medicare for all would increase taxes as specifically as biden suggests is an inaccurate reflection of the bill
we ve heard many debates over what medicare for all could ultimately cost but these specific figures were new to us
that is highlighting the potential tax burden of medicare for all without discussing overall costs is misleading she argued
biden used an unusual level of specificity in describing how medicare for all would affect families making between and per year
