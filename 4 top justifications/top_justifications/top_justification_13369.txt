"Iâ€™m one of two members of Congress out of 535 that takes no corporate cash, no political action committee money."
our ruling o rourke said i m one of two members of congress out of that takes no corporate cash no political action committee money
toward the end of his remarks he asked for personal campaign donations adding to cheers and applause i m one of two members of congress out of that takes no corporate cash no political action committee money
what i should have said o rourke said is that there are only two members of congress who do not take pac money and who also do not have a leadership pac which gives pac contributions to other members myself and ro khanna a california democrat
we inquired into the basis of o rourke s claim to for not taking pac money
otherwise we found o rourke was one of at least five not two house incumbents to keep no pac contributions in the to the elections
