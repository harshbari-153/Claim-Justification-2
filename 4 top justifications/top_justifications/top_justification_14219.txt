"There is no statistical evidence that bail bonds increase the likelihood of those awaiting trial returning to court for their scheduled hearings."
there is no statistical evidence that bail bonds increase the likelihood of those awaiting trial returning to court for their scheduled hearings etc
taylor said there is no statistical evidence that bail bonds increase the likelihood of those awaiting trial returning to court for their scheduled hearings
a key issue in the debate is whether use of a bail bondsman gets more defendants to show up for court so we wondered about taylor s claim that no statistical evidence supports the notion that bail bonds bring that about
there s no definitive evidence to be sure but various statistical studies have shown that bail bonds are associated with and may be a cause of lower rates
the study suggested that defendants released on private bail bonds are percent less likely to fail to appear than similar defendants released on their own recognizance no money bail
