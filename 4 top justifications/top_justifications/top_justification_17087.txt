"Alexi Giannoulias' top aide was a longtime BP lobbyist."
in the real world alexi giannoulias political director and top aide was a registered bp lobbyist from and that a fact
where do the candidates stand the announcer first touts kirk record and then says in contrast alexi giannoulias top aide was a longtime bp lobbyist
the illinois republican party website mocked the giannoulias campaign response asking sarcastically when is a bp lobbyist not a bp lobbyist answer in alexi s world
the aide in question here is endy zemenides a chicago attorney who is an unpaid senior advisor to the giannoulias campaign
is there a distinction between actively lobbying for bp north america or bp international and someone who may have worked for a subsidiary of bp that is not involved in oil drilling i think a reasonable person would see there is a distinction to be drawn there levinthal said
