Says in 2012 "Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID and lost in every state that did require a photo ID in order to vote."
an anonymous viral post claims that in obama won in every state that did not require a photo id and lost in every state that did require a photo id in order to vote
for this item we look at the fun fact at the end of the meme obama won in every state that did not require a photo id and lost in every state that did require a photo id in order to vote
the post is ridiculously wrong when it says obama won in every state that did not require a photo id
obama lost in of the states without a strict photo id requirement
if you include the seven additional states that asked for a photo id but allowed other types of identification as well such as a credit or debit card in the voter name obama won four florida hawaii michigan and new hampshire and lost three idaho louisiana and south dakota
