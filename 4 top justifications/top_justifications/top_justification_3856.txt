Four (maybe five) Latinos have served on the Austin City Council.
martinez said there have been four or maybe five hispanic council members
few hispanic residents elected to austin city council through history
and has austin which was incorporated in only had a few hispanic council members
asked later to repeat himself martinez said in a message i think we ve had four latinos in the designated gentlemen s agreement seat on the council plus he said another council member who says he was latino the late robert barnstone
that would be five total martinez said adding he speculated at the event that up to five hispanic residents could be elevated to the council all at once in the november elections
