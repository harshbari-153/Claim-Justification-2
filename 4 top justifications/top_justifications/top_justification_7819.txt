Hillary Clinton "agreed with (John McCain) on voting for the war in Iraq."
clinton and mccain had same vote on iraq war
clinton voted for the measure as did mccain
obama is right clinton and mccain were on the same side in voting for the use of force in iraq
in making his argument obama attacked clinton for voting with republicans on national security issues
among obama points it time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with john mccain is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in iraq
