bush said that obama will somehow manage to add more than trillion to the national debt which is more debt than the presidents who held office before him compiled together
jeb bush says barack obama will add more debt than all previous presidents combined
using this measurement then bush is right that obama will see the debt increase by north of trillion on his watch and that this amount will exceed the amount accumulated by the previous presidents
trillion to the debt and that s only if you absolve congress which has been controlled by republicans for most of his tenure of any responsibility and if you blame obama for all of the effects of the recession that he inherited
