"The economy began its nose dive when Democrats took control of Congress in January 2007."
now let look at the notion that the economy began its nose dive when democrats took control of congress in january
madam speaker i came to talk about health reform but would first note that the gentleman from virginia fails to mention that the economy began its nose dive when democrats took control of congress in january
measured by economic growth the economy did not technically begin a nose dive when the democrats took over
of course i think this reasoning is specious but it is equally ludicrous to claim that the recession which began in january was by a change in political control of congress that took place in january
the evidence shows that the economy did not nose dive for at least a year after the democrats took control of congress and experts of various ideological backgrounds agree that trends in the housing and energy markets played a bigger role in directly causing the recession
