The presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution.
limbaugh said the presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution
we thought we d take the opportunity to answer limbaugh s question and explain why the presence of gorillas doesn t negate the concept of evolution
so it s not that there was a linear progression from gorillas to humans and some gorillas just didn t evolve
in reality humans and gorillas are cousins having both evolved from a common but now extinct ancestor
a question for the ages why is a gorilla a gorilla and not a human
