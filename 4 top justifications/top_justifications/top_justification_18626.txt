Says Democratic challenger for his N.C. House seat "raised taxes on clothing, school supplies â€“ even baby diapers!"
house of representatives said his democratic challenger terence everitt raised taxes on clothing school supplies even baby diapers
everitt has never held elected office before so we were intrigued by the claim that he raised taxes on clothing school supplies even baby diapers
so if anyone in this race could be said to have raised taxes on clothing and school supplies it would be malone not everitt
house of representatives took a pretty standard tactic of accusing his democratic opponent of having raised taxes in a recent mailer
terence everitt raised taxes on clothing school supplies even baby diapers declares the mailer sent to homes in the area
