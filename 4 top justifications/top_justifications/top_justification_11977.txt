Says Lincoln Chafee "settled a union strike by giving the teachers a 19-percent-raise."
he settled a union strike by giving the teachers a raise
in september before chafee was elected mayor warwick teachers went on strike when their contract expired
the case went to the state labor relations board and was still simmering the following september when the teachers went on strike again
in spring after talks broke down and the state mediator resigned in frustration chafee stepped in and cut a deal with the teachers essentially bypassing the school committee
to reach a ruling we focused on three key points caprio understated the teachers overall pay increase and incorrectly said the settlement came during a strike
