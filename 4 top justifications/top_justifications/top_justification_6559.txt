"Kay Bailey Hutchison was elected state treasurer, succeeding Ann Richards. Democrats then abolished the position ... Hutchison later became a U.S. senator."
some republicans backed the abolition too and it was hutchison s democratic successor whose stint in the office came to a close
chronologically speaking for starters it not so hutchison won her senate seat in june while still serving as state treasurer and the treasury remained a agency after hutchison left for washington
later hutchison was elected to the u
as noted he correct that hutchison succeeded richards as treasurer
karl rove writes that democrats abolished state treasurer office after she won it and she later became senator
