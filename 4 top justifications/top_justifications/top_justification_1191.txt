President Trump was "kicked off" the California ballot
the california republican party recently claimed president trump was kicked off the california ballot as a result of senate bill
the california republican party made a misleading and blatantly inaccurate claim this week that president donald trump was kicked off the california ballot during a fundraising pitch on its website
but it doesn t prevent trump or anyone else from appearing on the california ballot nor does it mean he s kicked off
after we asked about the claim the headline on the party s website changed slightly from president trump kicked off the ballot to president trump off the ballot
no president trump wasn t kicked off the california ballot that s pants on fire
