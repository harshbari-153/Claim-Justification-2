Says Kathy Hochul is Nancy Pelosiâ€™s stepsister.
no kathy hochul and nancy pelosi aren t stepsisters
now we get nancy pelosi s stepsister someone else said on instagram
nancy pelosi is the daughter of thomas d alesandro jr
on the left you have the first female governor lieutenant of new york kathy hochul
and so in the bizarre tradition of people on the internet wrongly claiming that certain powerful democrats are related to each other we add another false claim to the history books that hochul is the stepsister of house speaker nancy pelosi
