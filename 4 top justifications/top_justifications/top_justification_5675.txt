"In Providence, R.I., it's illegal to sell toothpaste and a toothbrush to the same customer on a Sunday."
hey fans of rhode island trivia did you know that in the capital city of providence it illegal to sell toothpaste and a toothbrush to the same customer on a sunday
a toothbrush and toothpaste can legally be purchased together any sunday in providence
second who thinks the inability to buy a toothbrush and toothpaste together on a sunday is awesome
buzzfeed awesome fact about toothbrush and toothpaste sales in turns out to be awesomely wrong
we decided to focus on the toothbrush claim because we do want providence residents to be at a disadvantage when it comes to dental hygiene
