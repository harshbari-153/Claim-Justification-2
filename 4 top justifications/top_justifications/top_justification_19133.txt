AARP is "endorsing" the health care reform bill.
obama specifically mentioned aarp support for health care reform
just a few weeks ago on july the aarp issued a press release gushing about the introduction of the house health care reform bill saying this bill would make great strides for all of our members and their families
it was the suggestion that aarp had formally endorsed any particular version of the health care plan working its way through congress
aarp has been working with democrats and republicans to fix our broken health care system nelson stated
aarp would not be endorsing a bill if it was undermining medicare okay
