Says his job approval poll numbers are "not bad" relative to other presidents at this point in his presidency.
trump said his approval poll numbers are not bad relative to other presidents at this point in his presidency
we decided to trump s claim that his approval rating is not bad at this time by comparing his numbers to those of other presidents at the mark
but donald trump s claim that his ratings are not bad compared to other president s doesn t square with available historical data which shows his approval rating below all presidents for whom we have data at this point in their presidencies
the abc post poll actually showed trump s approval rating at percent not almost percent as the president stated
since the middle of the century pollsters have been systematically tracking responses to the question do you approve or disapprove of the way president s name is handling his job as president
