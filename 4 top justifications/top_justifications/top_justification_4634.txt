"Under Republican Governor Chris Christie, tolls cost more. Train and bus rides cost more. College tuition goes up. But Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires."
the ad is correct that tolls train and bus fares and college tuition increased on christie s watch but disregards that some of those increases resulted because the governor slashed funding in an effort to close budget gaps
and costs also have increased for train and bus rides since christie became governor in january
the ad goes after christie in a number of areas but we re looking at issues that are near and dear to many new jerseyans toll costs public transportation education and the wealthy paying their fair share in taxes
part of an ad about christie claims under republican governor chris christie tolls cost more
in february christie called nj transit a political patronage pit that needed to cut costs and said fare hikes would be unavoidable since drivers of the state s roads had just experienced another toll hike
