Claims Ohio Gov. John Kasich says climate change is a problem.
just kasich saying he agrees climate change is a problem
i am a believer my goodness i am a republican i happen to believe there is a problem with climate change reads a quote attributed to kasich that appears next to a picture of the smiling ohio governor
and there it is true that some republicans have staked out a position doubting that climate change is really a factor
and that many scientists have long concluded climate change is real
as long as kasich s comments aren t used as a scare tactic to get others to believe in climate change then the governor is ok with how he is being portrayed nichols said
