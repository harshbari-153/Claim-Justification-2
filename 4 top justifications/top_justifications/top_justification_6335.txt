Medicare officials have treated Humana and AARP inconsistently on how they can communicate with seniors.
our research shows however that aarp has a very different relationship with its members than humana does with seniors on medicare advantage
we found that aarp and humana actually have very different roles with medicare plans
in a letter to humana a cms official said that humana communication could be considered misleading and confusing to beneficiaries and might be construed as official medicare communications
a controversial mailing from humana to medicare recipients has republicans charging unfair treatment in the way the government handled private insurance companies versus the aarp
the house republican conference said the government is silencing humana about reforms that would change medicare advantage while the aarp a notable reform supporter gets off
