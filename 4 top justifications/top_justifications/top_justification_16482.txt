Says "on the state level, we spend less today than Jon Corzine spent in fiscal year 2008, five years later."
we re saying you ve got to spend less and on the state level we spend less today than jon corzine spent in fiscal year five years later
s ask the governor program christie claimed that on the state level we spend less today than jon corzine spent in fiscal year five years later
the governor is correct in that the fiscal year budget is nearly billion less than the level of state spending under corzine in fiscal year
on the state level spending is now lower than it was under democratic gov
but just because state spending is lower than it was five years ago doesn t mean it hasn t increased on christie s watch
