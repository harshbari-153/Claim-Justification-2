"Taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals" in California are "a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare."
a skyrocketing cost under obamacare
for these reasons the phrase a skyrocketing cost under obamacare is a gross exaggeration
however we believe a reasonable person would interpret it to mean that a policy of continuing benefits to illegals would mean a skyrocketing cost due to the newly passed federal health care law
the new federal law specifically prevents illegal immigrants from benefitting and most of the additional indirect costs that might be expected from expanding the medicaid rolls are already being paid in california by different state or local government accounts
as for the question of whether the federal health care law will lead to skyrocketing costs it would be incorrect to say that the new federal law is poised to increase california costs directly
