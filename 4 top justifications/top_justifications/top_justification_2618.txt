Quotes Thomas Jefferson as saying that "freedom is lost gradually from uninterested, uninformed and uninvolved people."
did thomas jefferson say that freedom is lost gradually from uninterested uninformed and uninvolved people that s what one viral facebook post claims
jefferson didn t say is lost gradually from uninterested uninformed uninvolved people
it is very unlikely that this is a verbatim quotation from anything jefferson ever wrote himself
the quote does not turn up in various collections of jefferson s writings and speeches
so add this quote to the tally there is no evidence that jefferson said it and multiple jefferson researchers told us they ve never come across it
