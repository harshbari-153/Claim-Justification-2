Marco Rubio is a "Miami lobbyist."
crist and democrats say rubio is miami lobbyist
the crist campaign and florida democrats use the present tense indicating that rubio is a lobbyist
senate campaign trying to capitalize on the public perception that lobbying is unseemly describes republican senate candidate marco rubio as a miami lobbyist or miami in its campaign literature
so we find that it quite a stretch for crist campaign to call rubio a miami lobbyist which conjures images of a lawyer representing clients in tallahassee or washington
one recent reference appeared in a march press release that carried the following headline marco rubio can florida afford a miami who laughs at ethics in the release the word lobbyist was mentioned three times in reference to rubio
