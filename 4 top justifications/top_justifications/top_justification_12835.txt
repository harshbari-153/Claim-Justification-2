very few states allow a governor unilateral and sole discretion to pick those judges who continue to serve
judges in north carolina are selected through partisan elections
however the proposed north carolina merit commission would have a different role than in most other states
currently in north carolina the governor has the full discretion to appoint someone to fill a vacant judicial seat to serve until the next general election
in the proposed north carolina commission the general assembly governor and the chief justice of the supreme court would select the commission members
