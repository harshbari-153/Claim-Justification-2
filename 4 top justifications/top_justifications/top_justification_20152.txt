"I did very well with young people in Ohio, Massachusetts, California."
and you know i did very well with young people in ohio massachusetts california
you know i was very pleased at the reception that i gotten here in pennsylvania
clinton did better among the youngest voters those under in california and massachusetts but fared worse in ohio
the figures for voters under are more reliable he said and agreed with clinton claim that she did well with young voters in massachusetts and california where she split the vote with obama
but by including ohio in her claim where clinton took less than half of the vote that obama won she has gone way too far leading us to conclude that her overall claim to doing very well among young voters is half true
