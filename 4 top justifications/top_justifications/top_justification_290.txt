"Switzerland (where the government) issues every household a gun . . . has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world!!!"
we thought the assertion that switzerland has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world was worth checking out
our ruling a facebook posting which has been shared more than times said switzerland has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world
switzerland has the lowest gun related crime rate of any civilized country in the world it a no brainer do let our government waste millions of our tax dollars in an effort to make all law abiding citizens an easy target
facebook posting says the swiss have the lowest firearm crime rate in the civilized world
it also not true that switzerland has the lowest crime rate whether or not guns are involved
