Providence teachers "can go five or six years without an evaluation."
taveras says providence teachers go five or six years without being evaluated
right now teachers can go five or six years without an evaluation
so taveras claim that teachers can go five years without an evaluation is accurate
but providence teachers automatically become tenured after three years and the vast majority of them
given the district small number of untenured teachers most do go that long
