"Weâ€™re growing union jobs faster than Illinois."
the most specific claim comes from holcomb of indiana we re growing union jobs faster than illinois
eric holcomb said indiana is growing union jobs faster than illinois
even before the great recession illinois had been losing union jobs at a faster clip than its neighbor to the east
but indiana was holding on better when it should not have because we are a more manufacturing intensive state and private sector unions are more tied to manufacturing
the difference between the two states is all the more striking when considered against illinois longstanding reputation as a union stronghold
