Starting in 2011, "you will be required to pay taxes" on "the value of whatever health insurance you are given by the company."
but the main point and the fact that we checking here is that you will be taxed on your health insurance
starting in next year folks your tax form sent by your employer will be increased to show the value of whatever health insurance you are given by the company
the is correct that employers will have to let employees know how much their health insurance costs the employer
the chain is correct that employers will be required to start listing the cost of insurance
this is how the government is going to buy insurance for that do have insurance and it only part of the tax increases
