Hillary Clinton wants to "wave the white flag of surrender and set a date for withdrawal."
john mccain has attacked hillary clinton saying she wants to wave the white flag of surrender in iraq
mccain is right that clinton is setting a time frame to start withdrawing troops and that does imply giving up and waving a metaphorical white flag
so mccain is right when he says clinton is advocating withdrawal from iraq
it hard to believe hillary clinton would say something so impolitic
saying there is no military solution as she does could be seen as a form of surrender
