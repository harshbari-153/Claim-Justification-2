Says that "93 percent of the time John Boccieri voted with Nancy Pelosi."
in fact percent of the time boccieri voted with nancy pelosi the ad claims
the washington post voting database shows pelosi has voted a mere times in the past two years while boccieri has cast votes
the gop candidate for boccieri s seat jim renacci has repeatedy stated that boccieri votes with pelosi percent of the time
but how much would the statistic change if boccieri s votes were measured against the votes that pelosi actually cast did he vote with her percent of the time we decided to do the math
it says boccieri voted with his party percent of the time over the past two years
