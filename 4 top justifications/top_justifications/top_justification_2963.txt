"Manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole."
but remember this manufacturing wages today in america on a basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole he said
rattner manufacturing wages today in america lower average wages in the economy as a whole
so punditfact wondered if rattner is right are wages in manufacturing a little smaller than average wages for the rest of the american economy
the manufacturing industry has a lower percentage of production employees
the reason for the discrepancy between hourly and weekly wages is simple manufacturers work more hours
