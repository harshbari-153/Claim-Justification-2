Before the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, "the State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya."
johnson said that before the terrorist attacks in benghazi the state department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security but instead actually reduced security in libya
the state department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security but instead actually reduced security in libya
is johnson right that before the attacks the state department failed to honor repeated requests for additional security and actually reduced security in libya
the second part of johnson s claim is that before the attacks the state department actually reduced security in libya
and it decided not to accept an offer from the defense department to extend the stay of one of its security units in libya reducing the level of security that was available
