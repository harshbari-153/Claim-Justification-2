Points of Light is  "the world’s largest volunteer organization."
so how can points of light claim to the world s largest volunteer organization
we say that of light is the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service
currently on its web site and elsewhere points of light is identified as the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service
points of light routinely provides a much more nuanced description of its work although the campaign pointed us to at least two instances one in and one in where the nonprofit did refer to itself as the world s largest volunteer organization
but he said points of light s description of itself as the the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service seems more accurate and a little less subject to being misconstrued
