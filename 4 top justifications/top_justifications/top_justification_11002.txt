Obama "suggested bombing Pakistan."
but it is a serious distortion to say obama wants to attack pakistan as president bush did and an even more serious one that he supports bombing pakistan as mccain did
barack obama wants to bomb pakistan
i do know if you received a text but my statement that i made at my speech was that he suggested bombing pakistan without their permission
the transcript of his speech makes it clear that obama is talking about targeting terrorists within the country regardless of whether he has the permission of the pakistani government
but mccain has ratcheted up the rhetoric saying bombing instead of just attacking and adding that obama wants to bomb a country that is a sovereign nation
