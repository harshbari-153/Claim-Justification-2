"One out of every two kids who are graduating college right now can't find a job."
our ruling the ad claims that one out of every two kids who are graduating college right now ca find a job
that s not quite right according to sum s research about a quarter of recent college grads literally can t find a job while another quarter have found a job but one that doesn t require a college degree
the ad would have been more accurate if the claim had been phrased this way one out of every two kids who are graduating college right now ca find a job or can t find one that requires a college degree
at one point goldstein said that one out of every two kids who are graduating college right now ca find a job
rather than roughly half of recent college grads not being able to find a job the reality is that about percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in jobs that aren t commensurate with their degree
