"I've always said it's (offshore drilling) up to the states and I still say that."
i always said it up to the states and i still say that
but as the quotes also make clear mccain as he said has consistently characterized offshore drilling as an issue that largely ought to be left up to individual states to determine
the second is whether regardless of his opinion he has consistently said it up to the individual states to decide whether to drill off their coasts
now off of this coast of texas i understand texans want offshore oil drilling
but if the states want to drill offshore and i hope they do
