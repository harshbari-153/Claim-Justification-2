"We're not allowed to read it (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) before representatives vote on it."
what wrong with it is first and foremost that we not allowed to read it before representatives vote on it
o malley said that we not allowed to read it the partnership before representatives vote on it
a reader asked us to take a closer look at whether americans won t get to read the deal before congress casts a vote on it
strictly speaking he s wrong congress and the american public will be fully informed of what s in the partnership before lawmakers vote to make the agreement part of united states law
even now when they are finally beginning to share details of the proposed deal with members of congress they are denying us the ability to consult with our staff or discuss details of the agreement with experts
