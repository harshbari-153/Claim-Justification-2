Under "his own legislation," Donald Trump's "own family would not have been allowed into the country."
bryce says that under donald trump s own legislation trump own family would not have been allowed into the country
in other words if legislation backed by trump had been in place years ago would his own family have been barred from entering the united states
his own legislation what he wants to do as far as unintelligible immigrants his own family would not have been allowed into the country based on what he doing
it seems unlikely perhaps highly unlikely that either trump s grandfather or his wife would have earned enough points under the legislation to be eligible for immigration
a washington post analysis cited to us by bryce s campaign noted friedrich trump s lack of and lack of job skills and concluded that had the raise act been in place trump would likely not have gained entry to the united states
