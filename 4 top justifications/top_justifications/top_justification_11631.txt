"The United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — (voted) to keep our government open."
was it accurate to say that the united states senate democrats and republicans acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open
obama said the united states senate democrats and republicans acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open
barack obama says democrats and republicans in the senate acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open
however obama went too far when he said the senate democrats and republicans acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open
but experts said that when analyzing obama s comment it s more important to note that not a single republican ultimately voted to keep our government open when the chamber took up the bill itself
