"I'm predicting (the Saints) will go not only undefeated, but all the way through the Super Bowl -- something that's never been done before."
i predicting we go not only undefeated but all the way through the super bowl something that never been done before jindal said in an interview with radio station wwl in new orleans the day after the game
gov jindal predicts saints will be first to go undefeated and win super bowl
but with the saints still only they need to win four more regular season games and three playoff games to finish perfect we think this smack talk from former dolphins running back mercury morris uttered when the new england patriots made a run at a perfect season in is perhaps more appropriate like i said do call me when you in my town call me when you on my block and i see you next door moving your furniture in
i think the saints are going to set a national record right here
we wish the saints and the indianapolis colts who are also undefeated the best of luck in their attempt to match our undefeated season and we will be the first to congratulate either team if they accomplish that feat
