"The Trump campaign asked that I release the list (of potential Supreme Court nominees) only after (Ruth Bader Ginsburg) passed away."
biden said the trump campaign asked that i release the list of potential supreme court nominees only after ginsburg passed away
his prepared line was it s no wonder the trump campaign asked that i release a list only hours after justice ginsburg passed away
it s no wonder the trump campaign asked that i release the list only after she passed away
in doing so biden wrongly claimed the trump campaign asked for his list only after ginsburg died
trump and his campaign challenged biden to release such a list on multiple occasions in advance of ginsburg s death
