After laying off 30,000 people,Â Carly Fiorina said that in retrospect, "I would have done them all faster."
the site claims that after laying off people carly fiorina said that in retrospect i would have done them all faster
accuses carly fiorina of wishing she laid off employees more quickly
but did fiorina say that she wishes she d done those layoffs faster this is more problematic
is the who didn t identify themselves on the site correct the number is largely accurate we it back in but we wondered whether it s correct that fiorina actually said she would have rather laid off people faster
smartened up now she says i would have done them all faster
