With his proposal to cut income and property taxes, Scott Walker is "increasing the state deficit at a time when borrowing is already at record levels."
we are wisconsin stated that with his proposal to cut income and property taxes walker is increasing the state deficit at a time when borrowing is already at record levels
despite billion surplus group says scott walker raising state deficit while borrowing is at record high
so how is it that walker is adding to a deficit is state borrowing at a record level
walker proposed the cuts after the nonpartisan legislative fiscal bureau in projected that the state will see mostly as a result of tax collections a million surplus by the time the current budget cycle ends in june
so it s true that because walker proposed property and income tax cuts the structural deficit going into is higher than it would have been if the budget had simply remained in place
