"Look at the debt that has been accumulated in the last two years. It's more debt under this president than all those other presidents combined."
it more debt under this president than all those other presidents combined
she said quite specifically that obama had accumulated more debt in two years than the previous presidents had collectively
second we ll assume that all the debt accumulated under obama should be attributed to him
because debt is cumulative minus any intervening surpluses the debt level for the previous presidents is equal to the amount of debt on the day obama was inaugurated
said last fall that the budget submitted by obama will add more to the debt than the outstanding debt of the previous presidents combined
