Says U.S. Senate opponent Eric Hovde "supported billions in stimulus for high-speed rail" Â and "billions more to bail out banks."
like barack obama the ad says hovde supported billions in stimulus for rail and like obama billions more to bail out banks
our rating neumann compared hovde to obama saying hovde supported billions in stimulus for rail and billions more to bail out banks
so at a point when it was clear there would be a stimulus bill hovde supported spending stimulus money on rail which likely would involve billions of dollars
let s see just how much support hovde voiced for spending billions for trains and to bail out troubled banks
hovde did express support for a bailout albeit with an approach he asserted would better protect taxpayers
