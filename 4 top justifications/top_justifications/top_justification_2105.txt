Obama's "first call (as president) to any head of state was to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of Fatah party in the Palestinian territory."
it said that after obama inauguration his first call to any head of state as president was to mahmoud abbas leader of fatah party in the palestinian territory
palestinian officials on the west bank bragged that obama called abbas first
the may be right that obama called abbas first
assuming obama did call abbas first and again we ca confirm that we do know that one of his very next calls was to israeli prime minister ehud olmert
one of obama first calls was to palestinian leader and israeli leader
