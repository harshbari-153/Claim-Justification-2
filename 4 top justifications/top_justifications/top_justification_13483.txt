Says "Harry Reid, when asked about the Republican field, said the Republican he likes the best is Donald Trump, and he said, because I can work with him. He'll cut deals."
then he added there a reason senate democratic leader harry reid when asked about the republican field said the republican he likes the best is donald trump and he said because i can work with him
cruz said harry reid when asked about the republican field said the republican he likes the best is donald trump and he said because i can work with him
cruz also glossed over the fact that reid said he is pulling for him which is not exactly the same as reid saying trump is the republican he likes best
ted cruz wrongly says harry reid likes donald trump best in gop field
we wondered did reid one of the fiercest democratic partisans in congress really give his blessing to trump
