"If you will go look up the definition of 'act of God,' we've used it in legal terms for a long time in this state."
if you will go look up the definition of of god we used it in legal terms for a long time in this state and the nobody knows what happened and i said that in my remarks that there were you know a lot of speculation
that said we quickly found several state laws that use the phrase
the legalese dates back to roman law and judges have since continued to rule that an act of god does depend on divine influence
gov rick perry says the term of god is a legal term prevalent in state law
but actually the term act of god has very prominent historical significance very commonly used in contracts
