Trumpâ€™s tax plan is "completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful - not the middle class."
schumer said trump s tax plan is completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful not the middle class
it s completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful not the middle class schumer said on cbs face the nation
it possible that by completely focused schumer meant the trump plan benefits only the wealthy and the powerful
does trump tax plan do nothing for low income earners
so is schumer right given the proposed changes to tax rates brackets deductions and tax credits does the trump plan focus only on the nation wealthiest taxpayers
