"Paul Ryan got his start in politics, as a young staffer just out of college, working for then-Congressman John Kasichâ€™s Budget Committee."
he acknowledged that kasich does not have statutory control over the board of education but he accurately cited kasich s forcing out of a state school superintendent as a demonstration of the governor s power over the board
john kasich said he saw no need for further action
a subsequent email from redfern that solicited letters to kasich and the school board demanding terhar resignation carried the subject line tell kasich fire terhar politifact ohio wondered if kasich had the power to do that
kurtz noted that kasich showed power over the board two years ago by forcing out superintendent deborah delisle who resigned citing pressure from the governor s office
using that example one would conclude that if kasich wanted terhar gone from the president s chair he has the influence to make it happen
