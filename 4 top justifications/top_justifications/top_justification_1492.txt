"(Big banks) have invested over $300,000 in (Joe Heck), and Heck has sponsored $44 million dollars in tax breaks for banks."
they ve invested over in him and heck has sponsored million dollars in tax breaks for banks the ad states
a new ad from senate majority pac claims banks have invested over in him and heck has sponsored million dollars in tax breaks for banks
heck did take campaign funds from banks and their associated pacs during this time
banks have invested in joe heck campaigns because they know he has a history of working for their interests and would continue doing their bidding in the senate if he has the opportunity he said in an email
over his entire congressional career heck has actually raised more than the amount from the banking industry referenced in the ad
