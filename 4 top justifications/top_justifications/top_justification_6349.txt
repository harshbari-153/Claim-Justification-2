"Casualties and deaths are at (their) lowest point since literally the beginning" of the war.
so by any reasonable measure mccain was wrong to say casualties were at their lowest point since the beginning of the war
and i advocated this new strategy the troop surge which obviously according to news reports that casualties and deaths are are at its lowest point since literally the beginning and the success is remarkable
but what about casualties
but as far as we could find no news organization or independent group reported that the number of iraqi deaths in may was a record low for the war
the military monthly casualty reports however include only those lost to service through death and wounds
