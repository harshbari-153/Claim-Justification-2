The budget hole in Bernie Sandersâ€™ plans "is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the United States."
buttigieg said the budget hole in sanders plans is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the united states
buttigieg s bad math exaggerates the budget gap in sanders big plans

he only explained trillion worth of revenue which means that the hole in there is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the united states
the flaw is that he used cost and revenue estimates for the sanders plans and stacked them against one year of the nation s gdp
