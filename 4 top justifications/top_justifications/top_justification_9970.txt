The administration has issued rules for "$1 abortions in ObamaCare" and "requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay" an abortion premium.
the obama administration has issued rules for abortions in obamacare
we ll look at whether the obama administration has issued rules for abortions in obamacare and required all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion
the claim that the obama administration has issued rules for abortions in obamacare is ridiculous the administration has simply set a floor for how much money per month of the premiums paid by those who have chosen plans that include abortion must be placed in a segregated account in order to make sure that there s enough money available to pay for abortion services incurred by people enrolled in that plan
the bigger charge that the obama health care law requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion is also incorrect
does barack obama health care bill include abortions
