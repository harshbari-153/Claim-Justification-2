a facebook post says joe biden wants to eliminate a regulation that requires school districts to report allegations of teacher on student rape alleged rape and sexual assault
for example under the original proposal the office for civil rights would have no longer asked districts to report how many allegations were made against a particular school staff member in certain situations
department of education s office for civil rights which conducts a biennial survey of public schools had proposed to stop collecting certain data points about sexual assaults and rapes by school staff not eliminating the reporting requirements altogether
a social media post says a federal requirement for schools to report teacher sexual misconduct is at risk but the post references an outdated proposal that has been withdrawn and it describes that proposal in a misleading way
