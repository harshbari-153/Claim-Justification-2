Says President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposal to allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines would make it the same as "the way you buy car insurance" today.
pence said that trump s proposal to allow americans to buy health insurance across state lines would make it the same as the way you buy car insurance today
during the presidential campaign donald trump promised to allow americans to buy health insurance across state lines
what the trump administration wants to do would make buying health insurance unlike the way you buy car insurance today not more like it as pence had said
we going to give the american people the freedom to buy health insurance across state lines the way you buy life insurance the way you buy car insurance
making the change trump wants would actually make the rules for health insurance and car insurance different not the same
