"Usually it's about $900 a month to get health coverage. (Florida's program has) reduced that, on average, to about $150 a month."
usually it about a month to get health coverage
when we asked crist office about his claim that health care costs are on average a month compared to under florida plan we were told that the figure cited by the governor came from the kaiser family foundation and that it refers to the amount of money a family pays on average per month
as for the average cost under the cover florida program crist office pointed us to a document that lists the different providers and their rates for individuals
so for example a woman who is between and years of age can pay a month for a plan that includes no deductible copays for doctor visits but no hospital inpatient coverage
and really the problem with health care is that it expensive
