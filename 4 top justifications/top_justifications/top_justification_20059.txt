"President Obama decided not to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York."
our ruling hasner said president obama decided not to meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu in new york
now we know why president obama decided not to meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu in new york next week because the president has decided to block out any noise that s out there about the threat a nuclear iran would pose to israel hasner said adding that the snub was an absolute insult and no way to treat our friends around the world
the specific talking point this time is that obama refused to meet with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu
so a meeting with netanyahu didn t fit obama s schedule
it simply would have avoided it becoming an issue that obama didn t meet with netanyahu
