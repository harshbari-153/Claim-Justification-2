"In South Dakota, Iâ€™m putting prayer back in our schools."
when noem told the crowd in south dakota i m putting prayer back in our schools she was met with applause from attendants
south dakota allows students a moment of silence when they can feel free to pray or reflect but officials in public schools are not allowed to impose prayer
though noem s statement could be interpreted as sharing her agenda in the next legislative session telling a crowd of christians that i m putting prayer back in our schools is misleading
kristi noem prayer back in schools no evidence of that
some christian groups advocate for prayer spaces in schools where students voluntarily can visit or teachers can hold lessons but the specifics of how noem would plan to put prayer in the schools are not clear
