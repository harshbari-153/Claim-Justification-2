"There's not a major bill I know with Hillary's name on it."
biden was particularly direct summing up clinton tenure saying there not a major bill i know with hillary name on it
in some ways biden assessment is correct clinton has not been the lead sponsor of legislation dealing with a major national issue that made its way to president bush desk
biden is correct when he says her name is not on a major bill but as biden knows better than most that not a fair measure of a legislator accomplishments
instead she has worked the way many senators do introducing bills that wind up getting included in another initiative drafting a senate companion bill to a popular house initiative or working with home state republicans to send money to new york or protect local interests
after eight years as first lady clinton deliberately sought a lower profile in the senate respecting the seniority system and tending to steer away from contentious national debates such as health care
