The Wisconsin state Assembly chambers extend to the bathroom and the parlor, and rules allow members to vote for each other if the member is in the chambers.
the written rules define the chamber as the entire area west of the easternmost doors of the assembly including the visitor galleries lobbies offices of the speaker majority leader and minority leader and hallways
the rules also say only the members present in the assembly chamber may vote
the bathroom counts as the chamber
the rule says you have to be present in the chamber
but is kleefisch actually right are assembly members really considered in the chambers when they are um on the chamber pot and can members vote for colleagues who are in the chamber and not at their desk we emailed and left voicemail for kleefisch to ask him to elaborate on his claim
