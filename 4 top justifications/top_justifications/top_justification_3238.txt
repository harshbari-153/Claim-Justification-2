A scheduled speech by President Barack Obama will be "the first time an American president has spoken directly to the nation's school children about persisting and succeeding in school."
but duncan was wrong when he wrote that obama speech would be the first time an american president has spoken directly to the nation schoolchildren about persisting and succeeding in school
bush speech to students is enough evidence to show that obama was not the first president to speak directly to the nation schoolchildren about persisting and succeeding in school
news reports from the time said the white house hoped that the address would be shown at schools nationwide and bush began his remarks by saying he was talking to millions of students in classrooms all across the country
barack obama is not the first president to address schoolchildren
the president will challenge students to work hard set educational goals and take responsibility for their learning duncan wrote adding this is the first time an american president has spoken directly to the nation schoolchildren about persisting and succeeding in school
