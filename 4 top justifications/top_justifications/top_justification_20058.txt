Wendy Davis is "fighting to bring ... Bloomberg-style gun control to Texas."
wendy davis is fighting to bring california values to texas including gun control
davis hasn t so far focused on gun control in her campaign
abbott said davis is fighting to bring gun control to texas
however she doesn t appear so far to be fighting for tighter gun control if elected governor
tribune news story hirsch emailed to us said davis was a gun owner and quoted her as saying of the gun show restrictions i haven t pursued it as a senator because i know it s like spitting in the wind and but i still believe it s the right thing
