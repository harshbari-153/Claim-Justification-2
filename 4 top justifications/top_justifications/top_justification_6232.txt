"As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes."
as mayor every year i was in office i did reduce taxes
palin can rightly claim that the property tax rate decreased when she was mayor
i eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax
but did taxes actually go down that depends on how you define taxes
so how is it possible to lower the property tax rate but take in more in taxes the simple answer is sales tax
