a texas sports editor wrote this column on christianity and prayer not andy rooney
facebook post the deceased cbs commentator waxed about christianity in his prayer
andy rooney is back from the grave to make the year the silent majority is heard and we put god back as the foundation of our families and institutions
christians are just sick and tired of turning the other cheek while our courts strip us of all our rights the post claims rooney said in a lengthy commentary
our bible tells us to pray without ceasing
