"When (Ron DeSantis) was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance, DeSantis said 'show up to the emergency room.'"
and when he was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance desantis said up to the emergency room
a gillum ad said when he was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance desantis said up to the emergency room
did ron desantis say cancer patients should be treated at emergency rooms
desantis did bring up the requirement that everyone be treated in the emergency room when a cnn host asked what he would say to a cancer patient who benefited from medicaid expansion
so desantis did make the statement that if people need care they can go to the er but he was speaking broadly and not only about a cancer patient
