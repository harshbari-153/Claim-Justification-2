"Ronald Reagan raised the national debt 18 times."
jim webb says ronald reagan raised the debt ceiling times
obama also said reagan increased the debt ceiling times
president ronald reagan raised the national debt times said webb a former republican who served as reagan s secretary of the navy
we came across several news stories saying reagan hiked the debt limit times not
a semantic argument can be made that the actual debt limit was raised only times during the reagan administration but we don t think it s worth the haggle
