The House impeachment rules resolution "does not provide the president with due process protections that were afforded to both President Clinton and President Nixon."
today s resolution does not provide the president with due process protections that were afforded to both president clinton and president nixon u
steil said trump isn t being afforded the due process protections that presidents clinton and nixon received in their impeachment proceedings since he can t participate in the intelligence committee phase and can lose his protections before the judiciary committee if he doesn t cooperate
richard nixon was not actually impeached
did past presidents get impeachment protections that democrats are refusing to afford trump
in other words those presidents didn t have any due process protections at that stage that are now withheld from trump
