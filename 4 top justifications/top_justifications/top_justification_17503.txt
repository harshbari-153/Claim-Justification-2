The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court "is transparent."
obama said that the foreign intelligence surveillance court is transparent
barack obama says the foreign intelligence surveillance court transparent
we wondered whether obama has justification for saying that the foreign intelligence surveillance court is transparent
obama it is transparent that s why we set up the fisa court
we don t doubt that there are good reasons for secrecy at the court but if you re going to operate a mostly secret court you also don t get to crow about how transparent it is
