Says Chris Christie told Donald Trump to interrupt Joe Biden during the debate because "people who overcome stuttering have a harder time maintaining their train of thought when interrupted. Keep interrupting him and he’ll stumble when he tries to speak. This will enforce the ‘senile’ narrative."
in the forum someone shared a screenshot of a grammatically problematic tweet that said vp joe biden has a speech impediment and christie told trump to interrupt him as much as possible hoping biden will be loose his cool
christie also addressed biden s performance and he said that he thought trump s interruptions saved him at times when biden was not seeming on the ball getting numbers wrong wandering in not being able to finish thoughts
no evidence christie told trump to exploit biden s stutter
i asked gov christie about this viral tweet and he says it s completely false and that biden s stutter never came up as a subject in debate prep tapper tweeted
chris christie spent several days helping president donald trump prepare for the presidential debate
