"When they say Mexico can't pay for the wall, I say of course they can. We have a trade deficit with Mexico that's unbelievably big. ... It's billions and billions of dollars -- far more than what we're talking about for the wall."
trump s statement prompted these questions what is the amount of the trade deficit and the cost to build the wall mostly importantly does a big trade deficit mean the mexican government has money to pay for a wall
however the bigger problem with trump s statement is he suggested mexico can afford to pay for the wall because of the amount of the trade deficit
trump said when they say mexico ca pay for the wall i say of course they can
donald trump s critics say mexico can t or won t pay for a wall at the border which he says is hogwash
it s not like there is billion sitting around somewhere in mexico like a magic pile of dollars that could be used to build a wall he said
