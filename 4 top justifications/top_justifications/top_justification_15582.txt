When terrorists killed more than 250 Americans in Lebanon under Ronald Reagan, "the Democrats didnâ€™t make that a partisan issue."
clinton said that when terrorists killed more than americans in lebanon under ronald reagan the democrats didn t make that a partisan issue
the democrats didn t act this way when something similar happened under president ronald reagan
still criticizing reagan over beirut was a big talking point for some democrats
he added that the beirut attacks and other significant foreign policy events under reagan pushed democrats and republicans to work together to pass a significant bill that rearranged how different branches of the military worked together
but it s not totally accurate to say the democrats didn t make it a partisan issue
