"Federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts."
that brings us back to brown original statement that federal employees make twice as much as their private counterparts
in politifact debut brown says federal jobs pay twice as much as private sector jobs
i recognize that our federal workers do important work but it s not right that private sector workers suffering through a recession have to pay for expensive government salaries he said citing numbers from the cato institute a libertarian
for example he said federal doctors and nurses typically do not make as much as they could in private jobs
and the public ones that pay more are not consistently double as he claimed
