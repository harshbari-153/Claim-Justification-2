Says Rick Scott called education not a "core function" of the state.
our ruling the florida democratic party said in a press release that scott called education not a core function of the state
florida democrats say rick scott says education is not a function of state government
but we found no place where scott specifically mentioned education and said it was not a core function of government
did scott call education not a core function of the state scott and the use of the word core to support their claim democrats pointed to a february article in jacksonville s florida about scott s first budget proposal which called for steep cuts to much of the budget including education benefits for state workers and state jobs
but he never specifically said education was not a core function
