Says the Chicago Police Department tweeted, "We are all Derek Chauvin."
no chicago police department didn t tweet derek chauvin support
we are all derek chauvin the tweet says
but what looks like a screenshot of an april tweet seems to show the chicago police department standing with the officer
sharing a video of chicago police superintendent david brown the department tweeted what happened to george floyd is reprehensible
in fact we didn t find any tweets about chauvin
