The Iraq war has been "our longest war."
we wondered if it really has been america longest war
still we think there enough evidence to say that the iraq war was not america longest war
to schieffer credit it worth noting that the iraq war has indeed been longer than many of the united states most significant military conflicts the war of the mexican war the civil war the war world war i world war ii and the korean war
so all three of these wars have strong claims for being longer than the iraq war
but we found at least three wars that were longer than the iraq war
