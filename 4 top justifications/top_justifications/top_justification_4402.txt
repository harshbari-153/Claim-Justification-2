Iran "might not be a superpower, but the threat the government of Iran poses is anything but 'tiny,'" as Obama says.
they might not be a superpower but the threat the government of iran poses is anything but
but obama never said the threat from iran was tiny or insignificant only that the threat was tiny in comparison to the threat once posed by the soviet union
but that does not mean that the threat posed by iran is insignificant
but mccain veers off the rails when he takes the next step claiming that obama characterized the threat from iran as tiny or insignificant
in fact obama has repeatedly called iran a grave threat
