"I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere."
today when palin says i told congress but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere it implies congress said here a check for that bridge and she responded no thanks that wasteful spending here your money back
i told congress but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere palin said echoing comments she made five days earlier when she was named john mccain running mate
despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about short of full funding for the bridge project and it clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
in the fall of congress removed the language specifically directing the money to the bridge but it kept the money in place and left it up to alaska to decide which transportation projects the state would like to spend it on
she gets credit for saying that they were not to go forward with the bridge but it was at death door
