ridesharing works for austin says in a mailer to voters a completely new criminal background check process will cost millions in processing fees additional staff and bureaucracy
austin taxpayers are in for millions of dollars in regulatory costs if voters decide not to change what the city requires in background checks of drivers for services a group says
rejecting the proposal the mailer suggests gives the city a blank check to fund a takeover of background checks and sends taxpayers the bill
there s also a separate percent fee to be in place if the proposition passes or not to cover the city s administrative costs and infrastructure needs the statesman reported
