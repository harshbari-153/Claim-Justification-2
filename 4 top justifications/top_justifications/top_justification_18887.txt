"Ninety percent" of people living in Gaza "donâ€™t have access even to water."
jebreal claimed that percent of people living in gaza don t have access even to water in the course of arguing that a significant part of the situation goes unreported in the united states
million that means that roughly percent of people living in the gaza strip could be classified as having no or very limited access to water
recent estimates suggest that about percent of people living in gaza currently have little or no access to running water a figure lower than jebreal claimed
but another way to look at jebreal s claim is the way cole said it that percent of people in gaza lack access to potable water
million palestinians living under siege in extreme poverty with percent that don t have access even to water
