trump said there are probably million it could be even million criminal immigrants in the country illegally
million total includes immigrants who are here both legally and illegally
million removable criminal aliens but that includes people here legally and illegally
trump s claim that it could be even million criminal immigrants in the country illegally also surpasses calculations from a group estimating it could be less than million
