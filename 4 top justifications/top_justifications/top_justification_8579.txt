Terrorist detainees "were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment."
but remember the terrorists were not covered by the geneva convention
cheney said that terrorist detainees were not covered by the geneva convention
so we ll take a closer look at cheney s claim that terrorist detainees were not covered by the geneva convention
it s misleading for him to say that such combatants are not covered by the geneva convention
the bush administration contended that the geneva conventions did not apply to terrorism suspects held abroad siding with white house and pentagon lawyers over objections from the state department
