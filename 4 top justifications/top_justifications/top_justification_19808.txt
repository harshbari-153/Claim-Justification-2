Says House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff "made up the conversation. He lied. If he didn't do that in the halls of Congress, he'd be thrown in jail. He did it in the halls of Congress, he's given immunity."
trump said schiff made up the conversation
trump has portrayed schiff s words as a fabrication that twisted what he said but schiff prefaced his remarks by saying they were not verbatim but were rather the essence of what the president communicates and in sum and character what the president was trying to communicate
experts said there is something to what trump is saying that deserves explanation but ultimately he s still wrong that schiff could be subject to prosecution even if he wasn t in congress
in a press conference at the nato summit trump once again attacked schiff over his remarks suggesting that schiff could be arrested for what he said
he did it in the halls of congress he given immunity
