Shirley Sherrod "was forced to resign before anybody on Fox said a word about this."
on balance these two caveats persuade us to drop hayes otherwise accurate statement that shirley sherrod was forced to resign before anybody on fox said a word about this by a notch to mostly trueso based on the fox transcripts as well as sherrod own account in the cnn interview hayes appears to be correct that sherrod was forced to resign before anybody on fox said a word about this
she actually resigned before or was forced to retire before anybody on fox said a word about this
sherrod must resign immediately
all told it seems clear to us that the usda ousted sherrod in order to forestall the possibility that commentators on fox cable channel would start calling for her resignation not because fox commentators had actually begun to do so
