"Nearly 60% of all student loan debt is held by the rich and upper-middle class," so forgiveness would give the wealthy a "financial windfall" but not really help low-income people.
grothman claimed that most student loan debt is held by wealthier people meaning that student loan debt forgiveness would be a windfall for the rich and not make much difference for people
but people with lower incomes also attend college and on an individual level may benefit proportionately more from student loan debt forgiveness
some people also have student debt so they would also be helped by forgiveness
so by forgiving student loan debt we would be handing the wealthy a financial windfall while low income americans suffer further from inflation and rising costs
nearly of all student loan debt is held by the rich and class he said in a may newsletter
