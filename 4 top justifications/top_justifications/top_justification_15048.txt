Says Rick Santorum "opposes right-to-work"
fact rick santorum voted against it in the united states senate
in this item we ll check the ad s claim that santorum opposes a policy that guarantees that no person can be compelled as a condition of employment to join or not to join nor to pay dues to a labor union as the national right to work legal defense foundation defines it
however the paul ad states that santorum opposes which means today
ron paul says rick santorum
we should note that the paul ad uses the present tense when it says santorum opposes so santorum s current position will be significant in our analysis
