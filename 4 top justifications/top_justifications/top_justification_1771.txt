Says New Hampshire’s second congressional district includes two counties where "almost 5 percent if not more" of residents are enrolled in the state’s expanded Medicaid program.
in the second congressional district one county has more than percent enrollment in the state s expanded medicaid program and another is pretty close
republican state cites higher than average medicaid enrollment in two nh counties
jack flanagan said that almost percent if not more of the population of coos and sullivan counties were enrolled in the state s expanded medicaid program
new hampshire s second congressional district stretches from the very top of the state to the very bottom and generally covers the western half
that s a lot of space and as you might expect use of the expanded medicaid which offers subsidized health care to people making less than a year isn t uniform across the district
