Ron Johnson didnâ€™t "show up" for a day of impeachment hearings.
pocan told johnson to do your damn job and show up retweeting a claim that johnson wasn t present for that day s impeachment proceedings
yes ron johnson attended the impeachment hearings
pocan s office provided no evidence that johnson was absent either day
so a senator being absent from the floor for a time doesn t mean they weren t watching
the tweet showed pictures of johnson and other senators describing them as the senators that chose not to attend the impeachment trial today
