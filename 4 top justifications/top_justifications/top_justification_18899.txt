"Global warming is part of (a) natural cycle and thereâ€™s nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles."
global warming is part of a natural cycle and there s nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles
a viral image claims global warming is part of a natural cycle and there s nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles
quote does not reflect scientific consensus humans do cause global warming
it does not reflect the current scientific consensus which is that human activity does contribute to global warming
it dates back at least to when politifact began such claims in when we found that the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists was that humans are the main cause of global warming
