"Attempts to find things like, ‘crime,’ ‘criminal activity,’ ‘indictment,’ have been filtered out by Google" in favor of Hillary Clinton.
we wanted to find out for ourselves if google manipulates search suggestions in favor of clinton
for example when users search hillary clinton cri the suggested searches are hillary clinton crime reform hillary clinton crisis hillary clinton criticizes obama and so on
the statement linked to a vox article that refutes the idea google is manipulating autocomplete in favor of hillary clinton
did google adjust its autocomplete algorithm to hide hillary clinton problems
google s suggested searches for the most part avoid offensive suggestions for everyone not just clinton
