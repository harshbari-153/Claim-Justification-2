"The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6."
the florida legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight amendments and
in this we seeing if hays is right to say that the florida legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight amendments and
but that not what hays said he said the legislature has not filed a lawsuit
the lawsuit was not filed by the legislature but the legislature is spending taxpayer dollars on a court fight whose goal is to have the amendments declared invalid
the lawsuit did not challenge amendment because that dealt only with seats in the state legislature while amendment relates to congressional boundaries
