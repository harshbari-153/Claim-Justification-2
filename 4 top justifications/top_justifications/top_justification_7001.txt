A recent report from the president's deficit commission was "completely empty" on controlling health care costs.
in ruling on krugman statement he said the deficit proposal was completely empty on reining in the future growth of health care costs
paul krugman said obama deficit had no ideas for controlling health care costs
what on earth is that doing in there here we krugman statement that the report was completely empty on reining in the future growth of health care costs
so the report was completely empty on the only thing that really matters and then had a whole bunch of things which involved large tax cuts for the top bracket
it does recognize that health care spending must be controlled and it not completely empty of ideas
