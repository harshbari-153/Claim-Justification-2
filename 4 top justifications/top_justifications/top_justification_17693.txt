the asserts that clinton and obama want to raise capital gains taxes and dividends taxes as well as raise tax rates for all income levels

dividend tax
we ca find an example of clinton directly addressing the dividends tax but she has spoken repeatedly about letting the bush tax cuts expire for higher income taxpayers
obama has said he will let the dividends tax cut expire so that dividends will be taxed at the same rate as normal income
