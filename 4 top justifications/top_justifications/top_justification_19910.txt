According to the Congressional Budget Office, "as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare."
so priebus is right that cbo estimated that as many as million americans could lose their insurance thanks to obamacare
while millions will be added to the government rolls millions more will also lose their current coverage priebus wrote later explaining according to the congressional budget office as many as million americans could lose their insurance thanks to obamacare
reince priebus says health care law could mean many as million americans could lose their insurance
the numbers vary but the cbo has projected that the number of uninsured americans will be million to million lower than it would otherwise be without the law
is the health care law really going to leave million american workers without health insurance from their employers we should note that politifact does not predictions
