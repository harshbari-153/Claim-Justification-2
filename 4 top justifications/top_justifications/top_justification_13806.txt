Says Florida U.S. Reps. Corrine Brown, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson are Socialists.
bloggers say corrine brown alcee hastings and frederica wilson are openly serving as socialists
at politifact florida we wanted to check out the claims that brown hastings and wilson are socialists or if it a virtual red scare
the list actually a roster of congressional progressive caucus members mostly from wikipedia includes florida democrats corrine brown alcee hastings and frederica wilson
and none of the caucus members profess to be socialists including our florida democrats brown hastings and wilson
so are they socialists neither brown nor wilson office responded to calls and for comment
