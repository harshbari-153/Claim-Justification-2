The HIV virus has been "detected in Walmart bananas after 10 year old boy contracts the virus."
hiv virus detected in walmart bananas after year old boy contracts the virus reads the headline on a post we first saw on feb
fake news claims that walmart bananas have hiv virus are fruitless
fake news is bananas by nature but one particularly slippery claim is actually about bananas said to be infected with hiv
one version said the world health organization issued a warning about bananas being infected with hiv in india
for the record hiv can t survive outside the human body so it s not possible for the virus to live in a fruit like a banana
