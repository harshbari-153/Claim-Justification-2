"In April, Sen. McCain came out against helping women earn equal pay for equal work."
mccain came out against helping women earn equal pay for equal work kimbel said
so we re clear mccain did not make some sort of public pronouncement in april that he is against helping women earn equal pay
hillary clinton that mccain still thinks it s okay when women don t earn equal pay for equal work
interpreted broadly one might be led to believe that mccain made a decision to oppose any help for women getting unequal pay
borrowing from a common theme on the campaign trail one of the women sherri kimbel calls out mccain on the issue of equal pay for women
