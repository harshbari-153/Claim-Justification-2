SaysÂ Peter Kilmartin voted "in favor of expanding the 'good behavior' statute to sex offenders."
wallin says kilmartin voted to expand behavior law to jailed sex offenders
my argument is simply that kilmartin voted for a bill that continues to allow sex offenders to get credit for good behavior
his claim began like this erik wallin candidate for attorney general today criticized representative kilmartin for his vote in favor of expanding the behavior statute to sex offenders and called for its overall repeal for those who commit violent felonies including sex crimes and domestic violence offenses
so when republican candidate for attorney general erik wallin issued a news release warning voters that his opponent democrat peter kilmartin voted to allow sex offenders to shave time off their prison sentences for good behavior it caught our attention
the new rules they said did not specifically exclude sex offenders meaning they too were eligible for the increased good behavior benefits
