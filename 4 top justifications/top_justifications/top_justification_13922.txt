Says President Franklin Delano Roosevelt "felt there wasnâ€™t a need in the public sector to have collective bargaining because the government is the people."
walker said fdr felt there wasn t a need in the public sector to have collective bargaining because the government is the people
he felt that there was a need and others like him former new york mayor fiorello laguardia and others felt there wasn t a need in the public sector to have collective bargaining because the government is the people
did roosevelt the patron of the boost in organizing by industrial unions in the private sector really take the position that when it came to federal government employees there wasn t a need to have collective bargaining
he and other historians note that roosevelt wrote that collective bargaining as usually understood can not be transplanted into the public service
and the current head of the national federation of federal employees says roosevelt s words meant he believed that there should be no right to federal bargaining over wages and benefits
