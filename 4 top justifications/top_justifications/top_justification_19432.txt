Californiaâ€™s shipping backlog is, in part, caused by a "California Truck Ban which says all trucks must be 2011 or newer and a law called AB 5 which prohibits Owner Operators."
not so fast it is in part caused by a california truck ban which says all trucks must be or newer and a law called ab which prohibits owner operators
the truck ban cited in the post refers to california truck and bus regulation administered by the california air resources board which attempts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and diesel exhaust particulate matter
but it s hard to quantify what role this law could be playing in california s shipping backlog
as hordes of ships wait to unload at california ports and elsewhere some are shifting blame to the golden state s regulations on the trucking industry
facebook posts claim that the shipping pileups at california ports are being driven in part by two policies affecting truck drivers in california
