There are nanoparticles in the COVID-19 vaccine that will help people "locate you" via 5G networks.
a viral video claims that nanoparticles in the vaccines are similar to pet microchips and that once you re injected by the magic of network your location is no longer a secret to the authorities
no vaccines do not contain nanoparticles that will allow you to be tracked via networks
the nanoparticles used in the vaccines are lipids
the vaccine and the nanoparticles are then injected simultaneously into your body
there is no evidence the approved vaccines contain nanoparticles similar to microchips implanted in pets that would allow recipients to be tracked via the network
