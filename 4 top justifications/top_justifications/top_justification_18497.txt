"Generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve."
is he right that deaths are pretty flat because we ve flattened the curve
on a call with wisconsin manufacturers commerce johnson said generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we flattened the curve
unfortunately we ve had more deaths but generally the deaths are still pretty flat because we ve flattened the curve he said on a call with wisconsin manufacturers commerce
johnson attributes the pretty flat deaths in part to a flattening of the curve which typically refers to the number of cases
and again the good news is if you do look at the number of deaths those have kicked up as well but it s still relatively flat
