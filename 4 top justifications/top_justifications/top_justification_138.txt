"At least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas" and there are "dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."
hunter said at least isis fighters have been caught coming across the mexican border in texas and there are dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol
border patrol agents caught them hunter also said but you know there going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol
similarly the idea there are dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol is missing a factual basis
border patrol that islamic state fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from mexico
no government agency confirms anything remotely close to the idea that at least isis fighters have been caught coming across the mexican border
