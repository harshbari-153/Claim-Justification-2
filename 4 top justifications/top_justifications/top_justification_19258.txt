One of the Planned Parenthood videos shows "a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, 'We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.' "
fiorina said one of the planned parenthood videos shows a fully formed fetus on the table its heart beating its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain
watch a fully formed fetus on the table its heart beating its legs kicking while someone says have to keep it alive to harvest its brain
fiorina s claim makes it sound like there is actual footage of planned parenthood examining an aborted fetus whose heart is still beating while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain
the video s creators added footage of an aborted fetus on what appears to be an examination table and its legs are moving
we don t know the circumstances behind this video where it came from under what conditions it was obtained or even if this fetus was actually aborted as opposed to a premature birth or miscarriage
