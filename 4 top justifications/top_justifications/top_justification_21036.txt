A clip of Joe Biden shows him reading a response to an interview question from a teleprompter, saying "I lost that line."
but a clip of the interview is being shared on twitter youtube and instagram with the false suggestion that biden was reading a response to an interview question possibly from a teleprompter when he says what the posts say sounds like i lost that line
interview shows that biden is not looking at a teleprompter but is responding to a question from a telemundo viewer who appears on a monitor
the monitor on which the woman was seen asking a question went blank as biden was responding which prompted him to say he lost her
telemundo communications director kevin gray told politifact that in the place where some are quoting biden as saying i lost that line biden actually said i lost that lady
no biden wasn t reading response to question in telemundo interview
