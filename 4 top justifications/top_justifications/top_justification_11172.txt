A bill that could restrict free speech when the president is nearby was signed by President Barack Obama "in secret."
the signing so was the bill signed in secret if it was then how would we know about it to write this the strongest evidence that the bill was signed in secret was that obama didn t sign it in a public ceremony
and after the second house passage it was hardly a state secret that the bill was headed to the president s desk for his signature
a summary on thomas the database run by the library of congress suggests the law puts up restrictions for buildings when the president or anyone else protected by the secret service is nearby
what the law says the federal restricted buildings and grounds improvement act of was signed by obama on march
so while it s true that obama didn t invite the media or other observers in for a signing ceremony the bill had gone through a very public process on its way to becoming law
