Since 2007, "Texas has gained 440,000 people" while "Maryland has lost 20,000."
over the same period texas has gained people
gingrich said that since texas has gained people while maryland has lost
as an objective fact in the five years you been governor texas has gained people
now if we having all this upward trajectory why is texas doing times better in population migration over the last five years than maryland
maryland didn t lose people in the past five years as o malley correctly noted maryland gained just over people during that period
