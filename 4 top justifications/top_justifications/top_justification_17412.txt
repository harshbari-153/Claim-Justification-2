The children coming across the southern U.S. border "were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles ... We now have an outbreak of it all because of our immigration policy."
we have a vaccination problem for one reason barack hussein obama and his open borders immigration policy which opened the southern borders to children sick healthy you name it poor just tens of thousands of kids flooded the southern border all of last year
limbaugh pinned the current measles outbreak on the central american children who flooded the southern border in
who said the disease was brought into the country by illegal aliens
as a final point the information on the measles cases this year reported to health departments fails to suggest a link to immigrant children
the common thread in these statements is the idea that these children were never examined that they had measles and washington took no precautions before allowing them to stay
