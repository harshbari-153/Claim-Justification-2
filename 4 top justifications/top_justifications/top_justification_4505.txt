mcclain said that in the infrastructure bill that just passed the house only is actual infrastructure

gop lisa mcclain s pants on fire claim that infrastructure bill is only infrastructure
instead the bill that passed the house and senate consisted almost entirely of traditional infrastructure provisions
while you were sleeping the democrats passed their infrastructure bill
