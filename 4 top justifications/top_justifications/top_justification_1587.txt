Trade deals are negotiated in "secret" and, unlike corporate interests,Â politicians never invite "the leaders of the AFL-CIO or steelworkers or the mine workers to come in and sit down in these meetings."
unions role in trade negotiations
now i don t know exactly how these trade deals are negotiated but that s a problem
negotiated in secret
he was correct that trade deals are negotiated in secret
however when strickland says that union leaders aren t invited to have a say in these talks he s wrong
