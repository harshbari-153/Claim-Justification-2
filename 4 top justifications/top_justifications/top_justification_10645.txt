obama s approval ratings are roughly in the range of some presidents
so the overall average approval rating for those presidents under melber s metric is about percent percentage points higher than obama
ari melber says barack obama approval ratings are in line with other presidents at this point
approval rating for presidents in their day in office
but this notion that this is really bad or worse for obama it s actually right in the average and if anything impressive because we re in such a super polarized time period
