"After 9/11, Jim put us all first by serving for 23 months in Iraq, the warâ€™s longest tour."
after jim put us all first by serving for months in iraq the war s longest tour
the ad claims mowrer served for months in iraq the war s longest tour
it s true that mowrer s unit was deployed for months the longest continuous deployment of the iraq war
but the ad says mowrer served in iraq for months which is not accurate
his campaign insists the ad is not misleading because his unit was deployed for months which included more than six months of training in mississippi before departing to iraq
