"Since 2001, higher education in the state has been cut or allowed to erode ... by 35 or 40 percent."
koster said that since higher education funding has been cut or eroded by percent to percent
percent of the total higher education budget
koster mostly right about erosion of higher education funding
assuming this year s enrollment totals track near s and there s anecdotal evidence suggesting it s not too far off that would mean the state now spends closer to per student
the legislature hasn t technically cut higher education funding over this time nominally the state has actually spent million more on it
