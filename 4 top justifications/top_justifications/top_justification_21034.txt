Says thereâ€™s no language in the U.S. Constitution that prevents someone from running for Congress simultaneously in multiple states.
constitution does not prevent him from running for office in more than one state simultaneously
constitution does not prevent him from campaigning in multiple states

he says he can run in numerous state primaries without living in those states
but doesn t the constitution prevent his strategy
