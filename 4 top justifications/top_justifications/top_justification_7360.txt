"There has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of this great city."
as a matter of fact to the best of my knowledge there has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of this great city
no alderman has ever dethroned a mayor
no milwaukee alderman has defeated an incumbent to become mayor according to donovan
back to donovan s claim that since the city charter was signed in no alderman has defeated a sitting mayor
and none has ever bested a sitting mayor experts agree
