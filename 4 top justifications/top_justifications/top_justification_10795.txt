Rick Perry is "taking money away from hurricane victims" and diverting it to "remodel the Governor's Mansion."
back to basics group says rick perry is diverting hurricane aid to remodel the governor mansion
after begging for federal hurricane aid perry is taking millions of it to remodel the governor mansion so he can move in faster
perry the narrator says does want to explain why he took money away from hurricane victims
but is that perry taking aid away from hurricane victims to hurry the mansion work
our take whether the fema reimbursements to texas amount to federal aid or not the statement that perry is taking money away from hurricane victims and diverting it to the mansion project is wrong on two fronts
