"Barack Hussein Obama will .. force Christian organizations to pay for abortions."
pac ad says obama will force christian groups to pay for abortions
barack hussein obama the ad says will move america to force christian organizations to pay for abortion
we also asked naral america an abortion rights group for its take the new policy referenced in the claim will not force christian organizations to pay for abortion
the wording christian organizations will be forced to pay for abortions is clearly an overreach
christian organizations won t be forced to hand over money for abortion procedures performed at clinics by doctors
