Says wearing face masks is more harmful to your health than going without one.
to make matters more complicated social media posts are claiming that wearing a mask can be more dangerous than going without one
the centers for disease control and prevention recommends that the general public wear cloth face masks in areas where social distancing isn t possible and says certain masks like the should be reserved for health care workers who are in direct contact with infected patients
prolonged use of certain face masks particularly ones like the respirator can cause problems for people with respiratory illnesses
i don t think that the general public wearing homemade face masks really poses a poisoning issue dr
there is data however that prolonged use of an mask can increase blood levels and therefore we do not recommend people wear masks for a prolonged period of time
