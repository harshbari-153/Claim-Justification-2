"Canada sets aside 36 percent of their visas for people with skills they think their country needs.Â  We set aside 6 percent."
canada sets aside percent of their visas for people with skills they think their country needs
and canada both set aside certain percentages of their visas
but we find that bloomberg misspoke when he said that percent of visas are set aside
bloomberg figure for canada may have come from a single category of economic immigrants skilled workers which if dependents are included accounted for percent of all immigrants
bloomberg assertion that any canadian visas are set aside is incorrect
