"Police training in Wisconsin is 21 weeks. A cosmetology license takes 40 weeks."
a cosmetology license takes weeks
a cosmetology license takes weeks
a cosmetology license takes more training hours than policing but comparison oversimplifies
according to the state department of safety and professional services applicants for a cosmetology license must complete at least hours or about weeks if you assume hours per week of training at a licensed cosmetology school
when you look only at training cosmetologists are required to put in more time than police officers
