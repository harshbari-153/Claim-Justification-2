Says "the New York Times wrote about" Barack Obama wiretapping Donald Trump during the election.
trump said the new york times wrote about obama wiretapping him during the election
the new york times report does use the word wiretap the print headline was wiretapped data used in inquiry of trump aides
when president donald trump tweeted on march that former president barack obama ordered a wiretap on his phones during the election he didn t turn to the federal intelligence agencies for proof
it does not back up trump s accusation that obama personally ordered a wiretap on trump for political sabotage
well because the new york times wrote about it trump replied
