COVID-19 "has killed less people than the damn flu."
no hasn t killed fewer people than the flu
in october for example donald trump wrongly said that is far less lethal than the flu for most people
even if people died of the flu annually over the past four years that s still fewer than the number of people who died of in the less than two years since the first case was reported in december
of course is a relatively new disease so over time the flu has caused more deaths than the coronavirus
it s also worth noting that the number of people who tested positive for the flu this most recent season dropped dramatically compared with years past
