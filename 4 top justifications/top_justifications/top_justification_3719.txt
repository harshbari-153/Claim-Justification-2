"The Republicans have never done anything really to balance the budget."
and the republicans have never done anything really to balance the budget
but the core statement here that republicans have never done anything to balance the budget immediately struck us as an overreach
have republicans never done anything really to tame the nation s deficit
republicans have done things that would lead to a balanced budget at present and in the past
cohen also said he doesn t believe republicans should receive credit for just proposing ideas on ways to reduce the deficit such as house budget chairman paul ryan s budget resolution that contained trillions of dollars in spending cuts
