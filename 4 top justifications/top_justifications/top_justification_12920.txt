Says the reasoning behind Portland's high water and sewer rates is "all kinds of ’pet projects’ unrelated to the core function of the water and sewer bureaus"
are projects to blame for portland high water and sewer rates
in a letter looking for donations portlanders for water reform clearly draws a link between the city s high water and sewer rates and all kinds of pet projects unrelated to the core function of the bureaus
we understand that of course but the way the reads it s the pet projects that are driving the increasing water and sewer rates
there s little doubt that portland has one of the highest combined water and sewer rates in the country
politifact oregon couldn t help wonder whether these pet projects were really the reason for the growing rates
