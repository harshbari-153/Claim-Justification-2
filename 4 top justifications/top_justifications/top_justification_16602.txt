The Keystone XL pipeline "would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what we import from Russia."
laturner said in an ad the keystone xl pipeline would have produced barrels of oil per day more than enough to offset what we import from russia
the keystone xl pipeline would have been able to carry up to barrels of oil every day the figure used in laturner s ad
this project would have produced barrels of oil per day more than enough to offset what we import from russia
the transport capacity of the keystone xl pipeline which biden canceled would have been about barrels per day more than the amount of oil being imported to the united states from russia
even in the future there would be no certainty that the pipeline could produce a net increase of barrels a day rather than just transporting oil from canada that is currently being transported some other way
