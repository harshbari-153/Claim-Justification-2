The DeWine campaign is "receiving money from so many more people.Â (Cordray's) money is coming almost exclusively from the party, labor unions, and special counsel that he has given business to."
surely cordray has received donations from the state party labor unions and lawyers who got special contracts that are routinely doled out by the attorney general s office
that s a clear majority of the dollars raised by cordray but a far cry from almost exclusively providing the funds as dewine had claimed
this is fueled in part by dewine having a lot more the republican had people who gave bucks or less while cordray only had in the last two years
his cordray money is coming almost exclusively from the party labor unions and special counsel that he has given business to
mike dewine says attorney general richard cordray s campaign is funded almost exclusively by party labor unions and special counsels
