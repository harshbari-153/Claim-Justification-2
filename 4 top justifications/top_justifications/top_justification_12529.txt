In the federal government, "thereâ€™s $16 billion in duplicate programs" that can be cut.
ossoff said that in the federal government there s billion in duplicate programs that can be cut
and there s billion in duplicate programs
so when ossoff says there s billion in duplicate programs that can be cut he s actually undercounting
there are indeed billion in cuts recommended by a credible study published by a nonpartisan arm of congress though not all are examples of duplication
the report which is mandated by law is designed to point out programs offices and practices in government that could be eliminated or changed because they duplicate other government functions or fail to provide value for the taxpayer
