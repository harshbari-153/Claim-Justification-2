The Obama administration "supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard."
turley said that the obama administration supported muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard
has the administration really supported muslim countries as they seek to spread an international standard forbidding blasphemy we took a closer look
in the obama administration shockingly supported muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard turley wrote and as secretary of state hillary clinton invited delegations to washington to work on implementing that standard
the american support for blitt said probably bolstered the voices of moderate muslim states that wanted to dial down the bad publicity they were getting with the defamation of religion resolutions
but blasphemy laws remain on the books in muslim nations and the largest international body that speaks for those nations has said plainly that such laws are appropriate and ought to be adopted in the west
