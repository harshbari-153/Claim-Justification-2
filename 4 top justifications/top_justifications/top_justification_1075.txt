"My recommended budget includes $1 billion in new state funding for education."
my recommended budget includes billion in new state funding for education scott said
rick scott says he adding billion in new education funding
scott is right that he wants to add roughly billion in funding for schools this year but we think it s disingenuous to call that money new a descriptor that gives people a distinct impression that education funding is up
the bottom line is that we would still be funding education at a level hundreds of millions of dollars less than we did in if the governor s proposal is passed
some of that billion in funding is to pay for new students and to close a gap created by lost funding from declining property values
