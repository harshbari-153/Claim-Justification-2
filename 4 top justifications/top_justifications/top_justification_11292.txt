The Supreme Court "can’t overrule the other two" branches of government.
in trying to make the point that the judicial branch has grabbed too much power huckabee said the supreme court can t overrule the other two branches of government
so the supreme court can clearly overrule the other two branches of government
mike huckabee supreme court overrule other branches of government
but the supreme court indeed has the power to overrule the other branches through judicial review the court ability to rule that a law passed by congress and signed by the president is unconstitutional
on the one hand huckabee glosses over the fact that the supreme court can overrule laws passed by congress and the president
