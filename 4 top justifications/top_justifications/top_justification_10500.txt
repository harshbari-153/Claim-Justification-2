the ad claims kasich had the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country republican or democrat
in an ad targeted at new hampshire voters a super pac supporting bush said kasich had the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country republican or democrat
does john kasich have rating on spending of any governor in the country
that s a potentially devastating claim especially since kasich is selling the economic turnaround in ohio as part of his presidential resume
kasich has little control over federal spending but he is using it to hide how much ohio s state spending has grown during his tenure
