brian kemp mandates restaurants reopen
kemp mandates restaurants reopen whether i reopen dining rooms or not
but we can if kemp mandated restaurants to reopen
following kemp s decision more than atlanta restaurants announced they would not reopen their dining rooms due to health and safety concerns though many are offering takeout
