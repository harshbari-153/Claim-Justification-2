The United States was not one of 16 countries where David Perdue said in his Pillowtex deposition that he created jobs.
not once did he talk about creating jobs in the united states
the united states isn t one of them
derrick dickey perdue s spokesman said a careful reading of the deposition could show perdue was trying to show efforts to save american jobs not just outsource them with his turnaround plan for pillowtex
in other words there were no questions about the united states
he does not reference the united states
