"Now, there was a time when someone like Scalia and Ginsburg got 95-plus votes."
now there was a time when someone like antonin scalia and ruth ginsburg got votes graham said
if you were confused about where scalia was coming down as a judge you should be voting any more than if it was a mystery about what justice ginsburg was going to do in these percent of the cases
here though we checking if graham was right that scalia and ginsburg were confirmed by such large margins
but we wondered if the margins were as large as graham said for the confirmation votes of justices scalia and ginsburg who represent the conservative and liberal extremes of the court respectively
but when he was here as a senator he set in motion a standard i thought that was more about seeking the presidency than being fair to the nominee when he said critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge heart
