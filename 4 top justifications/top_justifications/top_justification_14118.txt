"Thirty-four of the last 44 (debt ceiling increases) have been for less than a year. So, this notion that short-term is somehow the exception, it's actually the rule."
and by the way if you look back historically you know usually the debt limit is for less than a year he added
that is of the most recent times that the debt limit has been raised going back to congress and the president have had to come back within a year on occasions and raise it again
but he added a debt limit extension of three six or nine months would be routine based on historic practice
the debt is a problem but failure to raise the amount the government can legally borrow could be worse many say
of the last debt hikes have been for less than a year
