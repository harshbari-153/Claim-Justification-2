In 2004, "20 percent of U.S. households were getting about 75 percent of their income from the federal government. ... Another 20 percent were receiving almost 40 percent."
households were getting about percent of their income from the federal government
the percentage of households getting percent of their income from the federal government is an average some get more and some get less
another percent were receiving almost percent of their income from federal programs so another one in five has become government reliant for their livelihood

in fact another table in the report shows that excluding effective federal spending rates on public goods the poorest households get about percent of their income from the government and households in the second lowest income bracket get about percent of their income from the government
