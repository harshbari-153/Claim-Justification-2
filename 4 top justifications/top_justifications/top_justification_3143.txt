macdougall said that curbelo opposes the repeal of obamacare
we decided to if curbelo opposes the repeal of the affordable care act
carlos curbelo the repeal of obamacare says attack ad
curbelo in an email suggested the ad is misleading because he does want full repeal i support substituting obamacare with legislation that genuinely makes healthcare affordable for all including those with conditions and that does not punish low income earners and those that employ them
our translation is he opposes the appeal of obamacare but the ad is trying to refer to the repeal of obamacare
