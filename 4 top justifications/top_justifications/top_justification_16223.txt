"I used tax cuts to help create over 80,000 jobs in New Mexico."
it difficult to calculate how big a role his tax cuts played in getting businesses to create those jobs
james peach an economics professor at new mexico state university said many factors make a company decide to add jobs and that tax incentives often play only a modest role
still peach said richardson tax incentives and income tax cuts have created a favorable atmosphere for business that is a stark change from the state mentality in the when state officials refused to provide help to a promising young company named microsoft
statistics from the bureau of labor statistics indicate that new mexico gained jobs from december to july which is slightly lower than richardson claim
indeed much of the job growth in the state began before richardson became governor peach said
