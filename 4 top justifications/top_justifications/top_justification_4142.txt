Says that three of these five Republicans -- Ben Westlund, Rob Patridge, Max Williams, Lane Shetterly, Lynn Lundquist -- later became Democrats.
max williams rob patridge ben westlund lynn lundquist lane shetterly which three republicans later became democrats
heck three of them ended up becoming democrats later
all three served in the oregon house as republicans
shetterly and williams may not be republicans in coyote s eyes but according to registration records they remain republican voters
but the other four we were pretty sure they were still firmly in the republican camp and would rather be lawn chairs than give up their gop affiliation
