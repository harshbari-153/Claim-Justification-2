"The seed of Muslim is passed through the father."
his father was a muslim the seed of muslim is passed through the father like the seed of judaism is passed through the mother
but when we looked into graham statement that the seed of muslim is passed through the father like the seed of judaism is passed through the mother we found a good bit of evidence to the contrary
we wanted to check graham statement that the seed of muslim is passed through the father
in looking at most of the scholarly and objective descriptions of the islamic faith we found little to support graham statement that the seed of muslim is passed through the father absent belief in the tenets of the religion
graham said the seed of islam passes through the father to obama we found widespread disagreement
