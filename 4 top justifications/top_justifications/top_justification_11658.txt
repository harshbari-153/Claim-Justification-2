"President Trump signed legislation to clean up millions of tons of trash from our oceans and lakes last week."
president trump signed legislation to clean up millions of tons of trash from our oceans and lakes last week reads the text of a facebook post published on march
in late january an article posted to facebook claimed that trump had signed a bill to clean millions of tons of garbage from the world s oceans
that s because trump signed a bill that reauthorized a program aimed in part at removing marine water debris
no trump did sign a bill this month to clean up oceans
between the mueller report and efforts to undo the affordable care act is president donald trump taking on marine trash
