Timothy Simpkins, a Black teen shooter, got 1 day in jail and $75,000 bail, while Kyle Rittenhouse, a white teen, got 2 months in jail and $2 million bail. "I think itâ€™s pretty evident ... that white privilege is a myth."
a viral image contrasting the treatment of two teens charged in shooting cases said that simpkins a black teen shooter got one day in jail and bail while rittenhouse a white shooter got two months in jail and million bail implying that simpkins was treated more favorably
the image says rittenhouse shot three people in and got mo in prison with a million dollar bail and simpkins shot four children and was freed within hours and then bail was
but the post leaves out important facts no one died in the case involving the black teen simpkins who was charged with aggravated assault
the jail and bail details have been widely reported
the bail and jail details are correct
