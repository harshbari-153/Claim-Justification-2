"With the exception of baby formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely."
with the exception of baby formula oliver said the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date and state laws vary widely
oliver said with the exception of baby formula the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date and state laws vary widely
oliver was right in saying with the exception of infant formula the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date
while oliver s underlying argument for more regulation can be debated he s right to say that the federal government doesn t require expiration dates on food and state laws filling in that gap are inconsistent
in the absence of an overarching federal statute a jumble of laws at the state level dictate which foods require date labels
