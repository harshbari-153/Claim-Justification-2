The national debt of $16 trillion, is "enough to buy both the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds 1,918 times."
for example he said it enough to buy both the cleveland indians and cincinnati reds times
rob portman says national debt is enough to buy indians reds baseball franchises more than times
with a combined value of million by our calculation the tribe and the reds could be bought times for trillion times more than portman s release claimed
another way to look at it is he was correct in saying that you could theoretically buy the indians and the reds times with trillion but you still have
billion and the red sox at billion
