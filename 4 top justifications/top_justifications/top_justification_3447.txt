"The party in the White House" is responsible for "a massive tax increase on the middle class."
bush said the party in the white house is responsible for a massive tax increase on the middle class
it s not accurate to call the tax increases for the middle class massive
whether or not these taxes are as bush put it massive increases on the middle class depends on individual circumstances said kyle pomerleau a tax foundation economist
i would say that the tax increase in total was large and that some of it definitely hits the middle class in some way he said
but pinpointing the middle class as the recipient of a massive tax increase is misleading
