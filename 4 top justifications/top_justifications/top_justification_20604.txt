"Of course you've got a low unemployment rate when people've got to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet."
of course you got a low unemployment rate when people have got to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet
but his point that low unemployment indicates that people are working multiple jobs to make ends meet doesn t hold up
here we will examine gillum s latter point about the low unemployment rate is propped up by people with multiple jobs
gillum said that unemployment was low because people were working multiple jobs
unemployment rates are not influenced by how many jobs someone holds and not many people hold more than one job
