Says President Barack Obama has "not proposed one thing that would change" the fact that Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.
gohmert said obama has not proposed one thing that would change the fact that warren buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary
obama has said that you know it a travesty for billionaire warren buffett to pay less in percentage than his secretary yet he not proposed one thing that would change that
right now warren buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary
in fact obama has on multiple occasions proposed changing the tax code so that it complies with the buffett rule which attempts to ensure that people pay a certain percentage of their income in taxes that is at least higher than what people pay
the discrepancy between buffett and his secretary became a familiar refrain for other advocates of tax fairness including obama
