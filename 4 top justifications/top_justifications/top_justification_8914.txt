"Biden concedes 6 million votes."
biden left out the word million but he did say more than
on the assumption that he meant million people and based on the fact that i got that would mean that biden got million votes which is million votes less than what they said they got
a tv program called the real story made the ridiculous claim that president joe biden conceded million votes in the election that put him in the white house
for biden some seven million more than the
biden misspoke about turnout numbers but he didn t concede million votes
