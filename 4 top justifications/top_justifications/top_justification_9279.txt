Wisconsinâ€™s criminal threshold for drunken-driving is "way out of line" with "states surrounding us," which "have the second offense as a felony."
darling said wisconsin s penalties are way out of line with states surrounding us which have the second offense as a felony
iowa drunken driving becomes a felony quicker than under current wisconsin law but upon the third offense not the second as darling said
nationally about half the states mirror wisconsin s current approach or are more lenient in terms of when or if a felony charge enters the picture various state surveys show
it s well known that wisconsin is the only state in which drunken driving is not charged as a crime it s treated as a civil matter featuring stiff money forfeitures
in sum four out of our five closest neighbors clearly make drunken driving a felony faster than does wisconsin
