Florida "has the second-highest foreclosure rate in the nation."
it become a common refrain for florida candidates the state has one of the nation highest foreclosure rates

florida home foreclosure rate among the worst in the
that report highlights florida as having both the number of foreclosed homes and the foreclosure rate a subtle but important difference
we know the problem is more severe in florida but we wanted to know if meek was right that the state has the foreclosure rate in the country
