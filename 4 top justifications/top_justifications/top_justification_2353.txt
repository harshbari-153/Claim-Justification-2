If a lawsuit backed by Josh Hawley succeeds, "nearly 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care coverage."
could that many missouri residents really lose their health care coverage if the lawsuit succeeds
would million missourians lose health coverage if lawsuit succeeds
million missourians with conditions could lose their health care coverage
million missourians could either lose their health care coverage or be forced into an exclusion which would eliminate coverage for that condition but not all coverage entirely or see a rise in premiums
million missourians could lose their health care coverage it would be more accurate to say that
