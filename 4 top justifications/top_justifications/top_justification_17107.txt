"500 percent more traffic here?"
that is once the development is done nearby traffic would be up percent from the daily car trips of late
traffic studies filed in based on the developer s original proposal support the figure yet the developer later submitted a revised plan and its may traffic analysis suggests at most a percent increase in daily car trips still a substantial spike
next we wondered how much traffic near the site would increase if the developers added nothing
by phone drenner pointed out the may analysis includes a chart suggesting that once adjustments are made to account for car trips internal to the development there would actually be a percent increase in traffic
developer advocate says traffic likely to increase less
