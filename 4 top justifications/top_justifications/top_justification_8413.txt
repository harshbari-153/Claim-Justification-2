in california race whitman says poizner donated to gore recount
the ad asks how liberal is steve poizner then answers its own question by proposing a litany of evidence including the charge that poizner gave to al gore recount
this suggests that either poizner filed a supplementary form explaining the donation a step that recommended but not required under federal campaign finance law or that staffers for gore looked into the donation and had a reason to attribute the donation to him as opposed to his wife when they filed the disclosure form
it also bears mentioning that for someone the campaign describes as still being a democrat carol poizner has donated an awful lot of money to the gop
one ad aired by whitman beginning in midmay attacks poizner fitness to be the republican nominee in part by charging that he gave to the presidential recount effort of al gore and joe lieberman the democratic nominees for president and vice president
