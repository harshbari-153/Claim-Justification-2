Says Marcus Aurelius said, "Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth."
everything we see is a perspective not a truth
marcus aurelius s view wasn t that there are no facts
no marcus aurelius didn t say this about opinions and facts
marcus aurelius antoninus is not the same marcus aurelius who wrote philosophical musings in meditations and to whom this quote is often attributed
rather he believed there are facts but that properly understood none of the facts of the external world should disturb us
