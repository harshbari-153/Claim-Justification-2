"The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions."
the bill will not protect conditions
so although the collins referenced conditions when speaking on the bill there is no guarantee that states will be able to protect everyone with a condition
while the bill allows the states to make their own decisions meaning there s no guarantee that conditions will be protected across the board it is an exaggeration to say it has nothing to do with conditions
mccaskill said the bill will not protect conditions
the phrase conditions doesn t show up anywhere in the bill
