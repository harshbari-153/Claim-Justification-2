Property taxes have "nothing to do with the state."
cuomo said the state has nothing to do with property taxes
the state doesn t have anything to do with property tax levies malatras said
it has nothing to do with the state
but we were skeptical about his recent claim that the state has nothing to do with property taxes
because people think the state has something to do with the property tax and they used to complain about high taxes and fdr got very defensive and he said i got nothing to do with the property taxes it all local taxes and school taxes which is true
