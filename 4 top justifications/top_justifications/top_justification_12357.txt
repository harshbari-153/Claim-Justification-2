"Did you know Wisconsin's AFSCME union has lost 50%+ of its members since no longer requiring membership?"
in less than one year afscme the second largest union in wisconsin has lost more than percent of its membership
here in the beaver state steve buckstein of the cascade policy institute a think tank that promotes limited government tweeted did you know wisconsin afscme union has lost of its members since no longer requiring membership the tweet links to a june online post by buckstein called end forced unionism now where he quotes from an opinion column by syndicated writer charles krauthammer also published in the oregonian without the thumb of the state tilting the scale by coerced collection union membership became truly voluntary
has wisconsin afscme really lost percent of its members since gov scott walker ended automatic dues
the question is a simple one did membership in wisconsin s american federation of state county and municipal employees drop by percent since dues became optional here s a quick reminder of what happened in wisconsin in march walker signed a bill that drastically changed bargaining rights for some but not all state local and school employees
but what the union really objects to is the underlying premise in the syndicated column and by association buckstein s post that premise is that union membership numbers dropped dramatically because people were given a choice between joining a union or not joining a union
