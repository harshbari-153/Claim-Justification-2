Says getting ex-cons to successfully return to society is important "so we are not always faced constantly with recidivism, which is a big problem in the penitentiary today â€“ in the 70 to 80 percent range."
i think it s important also from the stand point of getting prisoners back into society so we are not always faced constantly with recidivism which is a big problem in the penitentiary today in the to percent range
but his claim that recidivism is a big problem in the penitentiary today in the to percent range isn t even close
it is specifically referring to inmates identified as being at high risk for recidivism
percent returned within years for parole and other technical violations or for committing new crimes
reducing the recidivism rate has long been a goal of odrc so politifact ohio set out to check batchelder s claim which suggests the prisons system is doing a lousy job of rehabilitating criminals
