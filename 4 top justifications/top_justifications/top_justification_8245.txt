Health care reform will not affect veterans' benefits.
so by all accounts the administration is correct that health care reform will not keep veterans from getting the care they currently receive
nothing in the house bill would affect veterans current coverage they both said
it s a myth that health insurance reform will affect veterans access to the care they get now axelrod wrote
the va health care system will continue to be available for all eligible veterans
one such distortion axelrod said is the suggestion that veterans access to health care will be blocked by the bill
