"Americans will pay more in taxes in 2011 than they will spend on groceries, clothing and shelter combined."
the reader wondered whether it was really true that americans will pay more in taxes in than they will spend on groceries clothing and shelter combined
in fact according to the tax foundation americans will pay more in taxes in than they will spend on food clothing and housing combined and it still not enough for barack obama
so in americans did indeed pay more in taxes than they did for food clothing or shelter
so while a substantial minority of americans probably does pay more for taxes the numbers suggest that there are more americans whose food clothing and shelter expenses exceed their tax burden
when priebus says that americans will pay more in taxes in than they will spend on groceries clothing and shelter combined his statement is vague enough to be read either as an aggregate measurement in which case he d be correct or a description of the patterns for individual americans in which case he d likely be wrong more often than he s right
