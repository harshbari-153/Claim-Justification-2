"When President, then candidate, Obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign, they refused to do it."
when president then candidate obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign they refused to do it
here we checking the from steele that during the presidential campaign obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign they refused to do it
the washington post claim though was that the obama campaign refused to disclose the donors
it may be a legitimate campaign finance issue but it not the same as saying that the obama campaign was asked during the presidential campaign to reveal its donors and refused as steele alleged
again it not that the obama campaign was asked for names of foreign donors and refused
