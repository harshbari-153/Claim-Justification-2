Says Indiana Gov. Mike Pence "provides zero state funding for homeless shelters."
mike pence provided zero state funding for homeless shelters
we wanted to look at the claim that pence provided zero state funding for homeless shelters
under the line item for homelessness prevention pence requested zero dollars in both years of the biennial budget
so pence has not requested funding homeless shelters but it s worth noting that s far from unique in indiana
advocates say the state has never funded homeless shelters a de facto policy that includes the consent of both the legislature and former democratic governors
