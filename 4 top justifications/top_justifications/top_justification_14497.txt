"The pass rate for a high school level test to join the military" is 35 to 40 percent.
but the pass rate for a level test to join the military is about percent i think or percent at best
bush said that the pass rate for a high school level test to join the military is to percent
but do only to percent of applicants for the military pass the test
for example about percent of whites passed the test for the air force while the figure was closer to percent for hispanics and blacks
by law the military can process any applicant who scores in the percentile or higher although individual services set their somewhat higher typically in the percentile range or higher
