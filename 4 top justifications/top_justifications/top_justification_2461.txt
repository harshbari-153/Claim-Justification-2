"This week liberal Bill White faced an ethics complaint about more than $83,000 he failed to report to the state Ethics Commission."
a link to the liberal bill video went to reporters on friday accompanied by this message this week liberal bill white faced an ethics complaint about more than he failed to report to the state ethics commission
our lingering question did white fail to report more than to the state as perry campaign says
and it misleading to conclude as perry statement does that white failed to report more than to the commission
not the point his campaign said stressing that white consulted accountants to make sure he complied with the law
could white have reported the money from wedge services to the state in the same way he did on his federal tax return anyway of only to avoid shots like the one fired by the texas gop
