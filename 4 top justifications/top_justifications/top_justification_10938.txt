"Alkaline foods" can heal the body of cancer.
the alkaline diet sometimes comes up in connection with cancer treatment and prevention strategies
we rate the claim that an alkaline diet can cure cancer falseno the alkaline diet doesn t cure cancer
a recent facebook post falls into that misleading category claiming that alkaline foods can heal a number of ailments as vague as pain as serious as cancer
because some studies have shown that cancer cells thrive in highly acidic environments the idea behind this diet is that consuming certain foods and drinks can change your body s acid level making it inhospitable for cancer
