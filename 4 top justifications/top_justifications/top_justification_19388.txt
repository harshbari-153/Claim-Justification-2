Says Measure 11 is "one of the most significant reasons" for decrease in violent crime.
doell says that measure is one of the most significant reasons for the decrease in the violent crime rate
essentially what doell and other measure supporters are saying is that there s an inverse correlation between incarceration and crimes rates as incarceration increases crime decreases
we believe one of the most significant reasons for this decrease is measure
has measure really helped halve the crime rate since
measure i think was needed in the because it did help us build our prison system but it s not at all what i would point to as the reason that our crime dropped
