Says Daniel Radcliffe has the coronavirus.
no daniel radcliffe does not have the coronavirus
the latest one comes by way of a tweet from a fake bbc twitter account which claimed that actor daniel radcliffe known for his portrayal of harry potter in eight films had become the first famous person to test positive for the coronavirus
the boy who lived does not have the coronavirus
harry potter is not in the hospital wing with coronavirus
that led to a genuine bbc news alert page but one that hasn t been updated since and has nothing to do with radcliffe or his fake diagnosis
