Says ICE and border patrol officers "unanimously endorsed me for president."
trump said ice and border patrol officers unanimously endorsed me for president
before we go any further i want to recognize the ice immigration and customs enforcement and border patrol officers in this room today and to honor their service and not just because they unanimously endorsed me for president
but it is misleading for trump to say ice and border patrol officers unanimously endorsed him
unions representing ice and border patrol agents endorsed trump for president
not all officers represented by the ice union voted to endorse trump and some border patrol agents in texas asked their local union to disavow the national union s endorsement
