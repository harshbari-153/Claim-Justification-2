The "moon has more than 250 million citizens."
the headline from a website called mysterious earth states cia release documents of moon moon has more than million citizens
next the item suggests that the very fact that it s conceivable that hundreds of millions of inhabitants live on the moon no matter how improbable gives credence to the argument that a substantial lunar civilization already exists
no evidence of million moon inhabitants that s made up
a online hoax claims entirely without evidence that million inhabitants currently live on or inside the moon
it is possible to tell this because when we have had things in orbit around the moon how they orbit in the moon gravity tells us about the mass of the moon
