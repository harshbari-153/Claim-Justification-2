a gas powered van towing a diesel generator charging an electric car
an image shared on facebook comes with the claim that a van is towing a generator that is charging an electric car
on its face the viral image seems ridiculous a van tows a generator that is being used to charge an electric vehicle
while the van in the photo is not gas it is towing a battery pack not a diesel generator
no that s not a van towing a diesel generator to charge an electric car
