"He positions himself as pro environment, but he scored a zero — yes, zero — from the League of Conservation Voters last year."
he positions himself as proenvironment but he scored a zero yes zero from the league of conservation voters last year the states
but there is a mitigating reason mccain got a zero
it also true that the league of conservation voters gave mccain a score of zero on its congressional scorecard placing him among eight senators who got doughnuts
but to say that it says something about his environmental positions is disingenuous
the republicans for environmental protection does its own scorecard but mccain did do so great on that one getting only points on a point scale
