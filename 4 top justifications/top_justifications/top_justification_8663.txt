"When my grandfather came to this country back in 1925, there were no government benefits."
when my grandfather came to this country back in there were no government benefits
santorum says when his grandfather came to the in were no government benefits
there s a lot to digest here but we ll focus in this item on whether it s true that when santorum s grandfather arrived in the united states in there were no government benefits
even if this overstates the amount it s clear that the amount of government benefits was not zero
and by the way all of us came from those countries because we didn t want those countries to take care of us
