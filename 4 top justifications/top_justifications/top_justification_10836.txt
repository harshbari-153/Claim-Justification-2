"Together we added more jobs than any other area" while I was Dane County executive.
together we added more jobs than any other area while holding taxes down
even if you take out jobs dane county led the way with new jobs
if you look at the raw change in jobs numbers for wisconsin counties in that period dane county home to madison did add more jobs than any other area
but if unemployment tripled could dane county have really posted the best record in the state on creating jobs in the ad falk does not specify what types of jobs but we ll examine private and public sector ones from march to april falk s tenure as executive
in an earlier item we found the dane county unemployment rate though it was notably low among the state s counties tripled during her tenure as the republican governors association claimed
