"The only time over the last 25 years when the stateâ€™s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when (Mary) Burke was commerce secretary."
average was when burke was state commerce secretary
average was when burke was commerce secretary
since wisconsin unemployment rate greater than rate only when mary burke held state commerce post gop says
in this case the state gop notes higher unemployment rates while burke was in the commerce job but doesn t directly blame her or her policies for the higher rates
indeed when burke cited her work as commerce secretary and said in october that when she left the job in wisconsin had more jobs than it does today we rated her statement half true
