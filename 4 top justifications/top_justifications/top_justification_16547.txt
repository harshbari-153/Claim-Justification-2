Henry Kissinger "said that we should meet with Iran — guess what — without precondition."
senator mccain mentioned henry kissinger who one of his advisers who along with five recent secretaries of state just said that we should meet with iran guess what without precondition
after the debate the mccain campaign was quick to say that obama had incorrectly described kissinger remarks issuing a statement from kissinger that said i would not recommend the next president of the united states engage in talks with iran at the presidential level
remarks kissinger made on cnn which obama was referencing are entirely clear but he did not endorse a meeting between the presidents of iran and the united states
to parry mccain criticism at the debate obama said that mccain own foreign policy adviser former secretary of state henry kissinger who served under president richard nixon has called for negotiations with iran without condition
obama is right that kissinger supports meetings without preconditions but he neglects to mention that kissinger specified they would be at the secretary of state level
