"I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book."
i authorized zero access to white house actually turned him down many times for author of phony book i never spoke to him for book
i authorized zero access to white house actually turned him down many times for author of phony book trump tweeted jan
trump said i authorized zero access to white house actually turned him down many times for author of phony book i never spoke to him for book
who gave him access to the white house what was he here for can you explain any of that since we don t have access to the logs
so while it may be the case that trump did not personally grant wolff access his own press secretary says the author had access to administration officials at the white house
