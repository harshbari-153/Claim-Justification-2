"Many of the alarmists on global warming, they’ve got a problem because the science doesn’t back them up. In particular, satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there’s been zero warming."
in particular satellite data demonstrate for the last years there s been zero warming
many of the alarmists on global warming they ve got a problem because the science doesn t back them up
cruz said satellite data demonstrate for the last years there been zero warming
we ve statements like cruz s before that global warming has stopped over the past years and that s reason to be skeptical of accepted science about global warming and found the claims lacking
however the scientific mainstream counters that it s misleading for climate change skeptics to assume this flat trend line will continue indefinitely or that it negates the likelihood of global warming
