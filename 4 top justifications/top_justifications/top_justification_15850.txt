billion tax increase which could have driven countless jobs out of state
first is the statement fisher served as gov
it is true that fisher as well as leading republicans in ohio at the time supported the sales tax issue that would have raised
fisher was in charge of the state agency most responsible for bringing new jobs to ohio but that doesn t mean he is solely responsible for the job losses
fisher also vowed that as governor he would not seek any increase in state sales or income taxes without voter consent
