After the 9/11 terrorist attacks grounded commercial air traffic, "there was a temperature drop while the airplanes weren't flying, for the week afterwards."
we did see in we did see i believe there was a temperature drop while the airplanes were flying for the week afterwards that there was an average temperature drop he said
when contacted by politifact rhode island gardiner said he was relying on past news stories when he made his claim that the temperature had dropped while air flight was suspended
as an example he pointed to the three days after the terrorist attacks when all commercial planes were grounded over the united states
they have suggested that the temperature change travis found might have been a coincidence the result of unusually clear weather during the period the jets were grounded
in other words the average low temperature dropped a bit while the average high temperature rose slightly
