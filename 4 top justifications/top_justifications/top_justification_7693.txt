"Barbara Boxer's worried about the weather" instead of terrorism as the biggest threat to national security.
barbara boxer mocks boxer for saying in that one of the very important national security issues frankly is climate change
is it fair to say that boxer concern about climate change amounts to being worried about the weather this comment conflates two concepts that people often confuse but are actually quite different
so while there is certainly room for disagreement about how big a national security threat climate change will ultimately be boxer is hardly advocating a fringe theory
by focusing on the threat of climate change did boxer somehow ignore the issue of terrorism we should begin by noting that boxer chairs the senate environment and public works committee which gives her a key perch for discussing environmental issues
boxer brought up climate change and said it was one of the very important national security issues but fiorina ignores that wording and portrays it as if boxer cited it as the only priority
