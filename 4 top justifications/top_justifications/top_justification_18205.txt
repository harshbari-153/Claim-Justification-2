President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden "left me 128 judges to fill. You just donâ€™t do that."
i ll have so many judges because president obama and biden left me judges to fill trump said sept
why barack obama failed to fill over judgeships
while trump inflates the number the bigger question is did obama and by extension joe biden drop the ball on judicial appointments
obama had a hard time getting judges confirmed
trump said obama did something wrong by leaving him judgeships to fill
