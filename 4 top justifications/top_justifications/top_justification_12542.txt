Says cuts to Medicare affect people who have already "paid in. We paid for it."
the ad says that cuts to medicare affect people who have already paid in
here we ll look at the claim that cuts to medicare affect people who have already paid in
the ad has a point that americans and over have paid in to medicare through the payroll taxes they ve paid throughout their working lives
while americans have indeed paid in to medicare the amount that today s beneficiaries have paid in only covers a fraction of their expected costs
so the ad s claim that cutting medicare is just not fair
