Voting for "any Democrat" gets you "socialism ... undefended open borders ... immediate tax increases ... 100 percentÂ government-run health care ..."
a vote for any democrat is not a vote for socialism open borders and tax increases
future said voting for any democrat gets you socialism
but that s hardly all democrats and it s not a call for open borders
is that really what you want voting for any democrat gets you all of that
i don t support open borders i don t know any democrat who supports open borders pocan said in a june twitter video
