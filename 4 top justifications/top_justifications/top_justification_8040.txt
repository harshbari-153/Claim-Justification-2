Commerce Secretary nominee John Bryson "appears to endorse world government."
anonymous gop officials claim commerce nominee john bryson endorses world government
that seems like pretty flimsy evidence on which to base speculation that bryson appears to endorse world government
but the claim that bryson supports a world government raises the rhetoric to a new level
brian darling a senior fellow at the conservative heritage foundation who was quoted in the daily caller story said it may be a rhetorical stretch to suggest that bryson was advocating a world government
we contacted the white house press office to see where bryson stands on the whole world government issue but they declined to comment saying the fuller context of bryson statement even in the short clip on the daily caller site is enough to definitively refute the claim
