"Texas mothers are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation."
thierry said texas mothers are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation
we wondered if texas mothers are more often dying in connection with childbirth than mothers in other states
thierry said it was clear that a special session was going to happen and we now know that our texas mothers are dying during childbirth at the highest rates in the nation
shawn thierry says texas leads nation in rate of mothers dying in childbirth
given the high rates of maternal mortality in texas relative to other states i believe this would mean that deaths in childbirth would also be high in texas relative to other states
