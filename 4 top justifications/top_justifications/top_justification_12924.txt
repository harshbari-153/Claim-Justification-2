Says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, "We’ll never have to worry about China attacking us! They are 12 hours ahead, so we’ll have plenty of time to shoot down their missiles!"
no alexandria did say we have time to shoot down chinese missiles
we ll never have to worry about china attacking us reads the text over a photo of the new york congresswoman that was published on facebook on march
they are hours ahead so we ll have plenty of time to shoot down their missiles
depending on who you ask worries about a cold war with china are or overblown
next we looked for social media posts and news reports about the congresswoman and chinese missiles in case she said something similar to the quote but we couldn t find instances of discussing them
