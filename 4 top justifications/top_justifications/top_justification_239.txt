jeff denham has agreed all illegal immigrants should be detained arrested and deported
jeff denham to donald trump s extremist views on immigration the democratic congressional campaign committee recently claimed denham has agreed all illegal immigrants should be detained arrested and deported
we asked the dccc for evidence proving denham has agreed unauthorized immigrants should be rounded up
but it s a far stretch to say his answer shows denham wanted to detain arrest and deport all unauthorized immigrants
we decided to check whether denham a incumbent truly has agreed with this immigration stance either recently or somewhere in his past
