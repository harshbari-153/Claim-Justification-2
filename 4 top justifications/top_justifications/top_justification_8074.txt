"Each [Corbett administration] budget finished in the black."
turzai wrote each budget finished in the black from the corbett administration
each budget finished in the black
with reports of deficits creeping past billion when wolf entered office and the gloomy measure of the state s finances referenced frequently during last year s budget impasse it may seem confusing to read that each corbett year ended so well
corbett did indeed end each fiscal year with a positive general fund balance
but even with these cuts the corbett administration didn t fix the state s deficit in his four years
