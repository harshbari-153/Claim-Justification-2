"More lives are lost from violence against women, sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, suicide, egregious maternal mortality, and other sex-linked causes than were lost during all of the wars and civil strife of the 20th century."
i m quoting the book here but it says more lives are lost from violence against women abortion female infanticide suicide egregious maternal mortality and other causes than were lost during all of the wars and civil strife of century
watson said more lives are lost from violence against women abortion female infanticide suicide egregious maternal mortality and other causes than were lost during all of the wars and civil strife of century
violence against women resulted in more deaths than all the wars and conflicts of the past century combined according to actress emma watson
however it s not clear that those lost lives are higher than the number of war and conflict deaths in the century
let s state off the bat that there are many difficulties with tallying up both how many women should exist but don t as well as how many lives were lost in all of the last century s civil strife and wars
