Says Sen. Bill Nelson "voted for higher taxes" 349 times.
by voting against the bill scott s office argues nelson voted for higher taxes
scott said nelson voted for higher taxes times
did bill nelson vote for higher taxes times no
this time he claimed that nelson voted for higher taxes times and that also rated false
just like republicans in the past scott s list overstates the number of times nelson voted for higher taxes by including nonbinding budget resolutions which accounted for almost half of the votes on the list
