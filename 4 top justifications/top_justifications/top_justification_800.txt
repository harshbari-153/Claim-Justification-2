Capital punishment is a "specific deterrent with the most heinous crimes."
but he also says he s certain it is a specific deterrent with the most heinous crimes
in terms of capital punishment and my views on capital punishment the jury is very much still out about whether it s a deterrent factor or not but what i am certain of is a specific deterrent with the most heinous crimes what we see happening on school grounds and when we see people slaughtering children and we see certain people sitting on death row who have wantonly just destroyed families and lives they deserve the death penalty and to take that away from a judge and a jury in my opinion is wrong bartos said during a debate filmed saturday afternoon aired that evening by in pittsburgh
he said he s represented people charged with or convicted of capital crimes for more than years and that anecdotally he s found the death penalty is a deterrent because nobody thinks they going to be caught
for these reasons and given the emphatic testimony of experts and the dearth of evidence they point to we rate his claim about the death penalty being a specific deterrent with the most heinous crimes mostly falsedayan said the question of whether the death penalty is a more effective deterrent than other penalties is crucial when considering the death penalty s role in preventing crime
