the irandeal will facilitate and accelerate the nation of iran acquiring nuclear weapons he said in a tweet on sept
ted cruz says deal will and accelerate iran getting a nuclear bomb
opponents have argued that it simply delays by a decade or so iran s eventual acquisition of a bomb or that the united states and its allies should have negotiated stronger protections or that by agreeing to the deal the united states is giving its tacit approval to iran moving toward a bomb after the deal s strongest provisions expire
the iran deal may be less than perfect but experts say it s hard to see how implementing the agreement rather than doing nothing at all would actually facilitate and accelerate an iranian nuclear weapon
