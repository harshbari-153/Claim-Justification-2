Says the "1986 Vaccine protection act" resulted in "the biggest jump in shots" for children because it gave drug manufacturers "exemption for responsibility of killing people."
a facebook post shows an image of the cdc recommended vaccination schedule for children and suggests that the national childhood vaccine injury act led to a jump in the number of recommended vaccines because it gave drug makers exemption for responsibility of killing people
the national childhood vaccine injury act was established after vaccine manufacturers were hit by a series of lawsuits in the from people who claimed they had experienced harmful side effects after being given the vaccine against diphtheria pertussis and tetanus commonly referred to as the dpt vaccine
look at the schedule we have gotten sicker and sicker spend more money on healthcare ever in history and the biggest jump in shots came after the vaccine protection act which gave them exemption for responsibility of killing people and destroying the ones they didn t kill the facebook post said
this prompted the cdc to warn the nation its stockpile of vaccinations was running low and eventually led to the passage of the national childhood vaccine injury act
one account that shared the image blamed the national childhood vaccine injury act as the reason behind the increase
