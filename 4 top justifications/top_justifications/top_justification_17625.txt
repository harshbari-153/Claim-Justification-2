"Cory Booker and all these people couldn't get any of the things that (Michael) Bloomberg's getting now" with respect to DNC debate rules.
cory booker and all these people couldn t get any of the things that bloomberg s getting now he said
trump said cory booker and all these people couldn t get any of the things that bloomberg s getting now
warren tweeted that the dnc was letting bloomberg play by different rules
debate simply by hitting the polling mark bloomberg who had called for the dnc to get rid of the donor requirement now has a shot
but the new rules are slightly different than what booker asked for and while they pave a path for bloomberg to make his first debate they don t guarantee that he ll earn a spot on stage
