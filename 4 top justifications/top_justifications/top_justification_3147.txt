Richard Cordrayâ€™s nomination to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau marks the first time in Senate history "that a political party has blocked a nomination of someone because they didn't like the construction of the agency."
the next day shortly before the senate failed to get enough votes to cut off debate and confirm the nominee senate majority leader harry reid democrat of nevada said the same thing this is the first time in senate history a party has blocked a qualified candidate solely because they disagree with the existence of the agency that being created by law
and some time ago i asked the senate historian has this ever happened that a political party has blocked a nomination of someone because they did like the construction of the agency and he said no it never happened
to better understand this distinction it s important to know that in the case of cordray of the senate s republicans made clear in a letter before the ohioan was even nominated that they would not accept any nominee unless the agency s structure was changed
but based on the record including its nuance we take the senate historian s word brown was correct when he said this was the first time that a political party has blocked a nomination unless changes were made to an agency
sherrod brown says republicans refusal to confirm richard cordray to head consumer protection bureau was unprecedented
