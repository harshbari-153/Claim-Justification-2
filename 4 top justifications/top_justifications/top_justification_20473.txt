Says "Three Muslim congresswomen just refused" to sign an oath of office to uphold the U.S. Constitution.
it then goes on to claim that three muslim congresswomen just refused to do so
constitution as every other holder of that office is required to do you should not be allowed to serve three muslim congresswomen just refused
a popular meme says politicians shouldn t be allowed to serve if they refuse to take an oath of office and that three muslim congresswomen refused
no three muslim congresswomen did not to take the oath the ceremony has happened yet
looking for one more reason that this claim is a hoax there will not be three muslim women serving in congress in like the post claimed
