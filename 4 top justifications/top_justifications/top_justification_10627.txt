"Nobody applies to the United States for refugee status. They apply to the United Nations."
mccaskill said nobody applies to the united states for refugee status
let me first start with this important principle nobody applies to the united states for refugee status
do all people seeking refugee status have to go through the united nations first
resettlement does not apply to every person seeking refugee status
in priority cases individuals are referred to the united states refugee admissions program by the united nations high commissioner for refugees based on their circumstances and need for resettlement
