Says Donald Trump was caught on a hot mic insulting his supporters.
hot mics have burned many politicians even president donald trump
no trump wasn t caught insulting his supporters
a banner beneath the video says trump off the record and gives a link to the website of project veritas a conservative group known for going undercover with hidden cameras to record democratic politicians and liberal groups among others and then posting often videos online
but a recent video supposedly showing him insulting his supporters as he tours a north carolina facility working on a vaccine was created as a joke
though the voice in the video sounds like the president comedian cauvin a talented trump impersonator has claimed credit
