Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson "gave child porn offenders sentences below the guidelines and below what the prosecutors were requesting," showing she is "soft on child pornography offenders."
hawley said jackson gave child porn offenders sentences below the guidelines and below what the prosecutors were requesting showing she is soft on child pornography offenders
in fact in every case for which i can find records and judge jackson had discretion she gave child porn offenders sentences below the guidelines and below what the prosecutors were requesting hawley wrote
but jackson s approach to sentencing in child pornography cases did not significantly differ from that of other judges data show
accused her in an of having a pattern of going soft on child pornography offenders
it bears noting that for more severe cases that combined possession of child pornography with attemped or actual sexual abuse of a minor jackson generally accepted the prosecution s recommendation
