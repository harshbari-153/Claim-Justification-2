Says "Eric Holder and his group came in and made" the Wisconsin Supreme Court race "highly partisan."
walker says holder and his group came in and made the wisconsin supreme court race highly partisan
wisconsin supreme court races have seen partisan involvement in recent years but the race set a new standard for partisanship
but the wisconsin republican party played a major role in backing screnock starting before holder did and it doesn t get much more partisan than a political party
let s see if it was holder the attorney general for most of obama s presidency who is considering a run for president himself in who made the supreme court race highly partisan
and it s true that as national figures holder and his group added a national partisan dimension to the race
