hightower said the postal service has taken no taxpayer aid since funds operations entirely from the sale of stamps and the like and makes an operational profit year after year
postal service which operates on sales of stamps last had profit in and took last taxpayer aid in
so the service has not taken taxpayer dimes since
hutkins suggested we discount the taxpayer aid that went to the service after its inception saying by email that that funding was not because the postal service was running deficits
not a dime of tax aid since
