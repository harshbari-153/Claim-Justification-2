The FCC’s net neutrality policy includes what is "essentially a massive tax increase."
lee said the fcc s net neutrality policy is essentially a massive tax increase
does net neutrality mean a big tax increase
that means the fcc could levy taxes on its own even if it wanted to
literally there won t be any new taxes as a result of the fcc changes but there will likely be additional fees
this is essentially a massive tax increase on the middle class being passed in the dead of night without the american public really being made aware of what is going on sen
