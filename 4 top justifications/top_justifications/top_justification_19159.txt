"On (Tom) Wolfâ€™s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs."
corbett s ad claimed that on wolf s watch taxes were high killing pa jobs
that s a lot of claims for a brief ad but for this we re going to focus on the claim that on wolf s watch taxes were high killing pa jobs
on wolf s watch taxes were high killing pa jobs and our unemployment went up almost percent
to the extent that taxes were high was wolf responsible
why does this matter because the ad said that on wolf s watch taxes were high
