The five states that outlaw collective bargaining for teachers all rank below 44th in the nation in test scores, while Wisconsin ranks 2nd.
looking only at these six states there s a suggestion that lack of collective bargaining rights for teachers is mildly correlated with test scores even though the linkage is a lot less striking than the facebook post suggests
labor union supporters say wisconsin test scores vastly outpace those in five states without collective bargaining for teachers
first we checked to see whether it s true that only five states bar teachers from collective bargaining
most of the states that don t have teachers unions are poorer than wisconsin and have more english language learners in their schools and rank higher for other demographic factors that make strong academic performance less likely johnston wrote
so on neither test did the five bargaining states perform as well as wisconsin did and in general those five states clustered in the bottom half of the national rankings
