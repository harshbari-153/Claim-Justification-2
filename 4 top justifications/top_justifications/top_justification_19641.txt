An amendment to the House health reform bill "puts new restrictions on women's access to abortion coverage in the private health insurance market even when they would pay premiums with their own money."
but lowey said the amendment puts new restrictions on women access to abortion coverage in the private health insurance market even when they would pay premiums with their own money
for this item we explore whether she is correct that it puts new restrictions on abortion coverage in the private market even when women would pay their own premium
some critics say that the amendment throws up enough obstacles against offering abortion coverage on the health exchange particularly the requirement to offer two separate plans one of them without abortion provisions that insurers will simply take the path of least resistance and offer a single plan that leaves out abortion coverage
specifically at issue is whether the new system of exchanges and subsidies for uninsured americans envisioned by the house health care bill would result in federal money being spent on abortion services something that has been barred since with passage of the hyde amendment
has explicit restrictions on abortion coverage that go beyond the language of the original bill
