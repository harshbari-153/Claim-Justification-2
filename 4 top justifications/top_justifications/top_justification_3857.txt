"Forty percent of people in this country, illegally, are overstaying visas."
rubio said percent of people in this country illegally are overstaying visas
but is it true that percent of illegal immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas it turns out that we hear the figure so often because it s the most commonly accepted estimate although it s getting a little long in the tooth
since there are more immigrants overstaying their visas than crossing the border illegally but there are fewer illegal immigrants in the country overall
we have a porous border meaning not just the border with mexico but percent of people in this country illegally are overstaying visas he said on fox friends on july
there have been other estimates of overstays in january ins released an updated report that said percent of the illegal immigrant population in had entered the country legally
