democrats flip flop on conditions
did wisconsin democrats flip flop on conditions because they voted against a gop bill
in short democrats votes against what they considered to be an inferior bill is not a flip flop on protecting people with conditions
darling argued that democrats flip flopped on their campaigning because the senate democrats voted against the gop conditions bill
darling declared democrats flip flop on conditions referring to all democrats in the state senate voting against a republican bill on medical conditions
