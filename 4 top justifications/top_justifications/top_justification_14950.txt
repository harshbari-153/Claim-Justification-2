The United States has "more of our people in prison than Russia, China, and North Korea combined."
we have more of our people in prison than russia china and north korea combined the column said
prison population when they wrote we have more of our people in prison than russia china and north korea combined
is the prison population as big as russia china and north korea combined
cooke said he would change the line in the column to be more accurate and it now says we have more of our people in prison than anyone else more than iran more than north korea more than russia or even china
and in many cases its reputation for incarcerating more people than any other country is deserved
