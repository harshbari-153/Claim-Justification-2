U.S. Rep. Connie Mack "voted to raise his own pay several times."
george lemieux says connie mack repeatedly voted to raise his own paycheck
instead mack cast procedural votes that effectively allowed automatic pay raises to stand in and
the practical effect of those votes meant mack saw raises
this time mack and a large majority of the house voted yes on house resolution which canceled the annual pay raise
here are the salaries for the years that mack has served year annual salary so how did the lemieux campaign back up its attack not with votes to raise congressional salaries as had been claimed but instead votes to prevent congress from taking a vote to cancel the automatic pay adjustment
