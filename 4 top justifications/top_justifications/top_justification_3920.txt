The Georgia Legislatureâ€™s last day of session ends at midnight.
typically the legislature ends by midnight of the last day so as not to exceed the constitutionally mandated session according to atlanta coverage of the deals
but ralston s implication is clear history dictates the session s final day and eligible votes ends at midnight
so the state senate s wee hour vote last week ralston implied that there is a midnight deadline for action
it is going to end at midnight today in the house even though i understand the other chamber may stay later
that s because georgia meets by legislative not calendar day
