In Rhode Island, "only 5 percent of ozone pollution is from local or in-state sources. . . Ninety-five percent comes from outside of our borders, particularly the Midwest."
now in rhode island specifically only percent of ozone pollution is from local or sources
our ruling jack reed said percent of rhode island ozone pollution comes from outside the state and most of it is imported from the midwest
rhode island jack reed says percent of the state ozone pollution comes from out of state particularly the midwest
so which states are giving us all this pollution reed said the primary source of the ozone is the midwest
the percentages come from a epa report the most recent available that looks at not ozone directly but the pollutants that generate ozone under the right conditions
