"While he was president, President Trump never encouraged Americans to get vaccinated."
maddow said while he was president president trump never encouraged americans to get vaccinated
but is it true that as president trump never encouraged americans to get vaccinated as maddow claimed
while he was president president trump never encouraged americans to get vaccinated maddow said march on her tv show
was the first time he encouraged people to go get vaccinated and that he never publicly encouraged people to take it while he was in office
i thought when we reported last night that while he was president he had actually never told americans to get vaccinated maddow said march
