The Arab Spring â€¦ "drove up gas prices."
we ll take a look at one portion of his comment that the arab spring the democratic movement that swept the middle east and north africa in early drove up gas prices
the arab spring did result in higher gasoline prices for one specific reason it took almost all of libya s
obama is right that the arab spring was a factor in the increase in gasoline prices
we found that he correct that the arab spring did have an impact on oil prices but that it was just one of many factors
but the combination of a japanese tsunami the arab spring which drove up gas prices and most prominently economic turmoil in europe i think has gotten businesses and consumers very nervous
