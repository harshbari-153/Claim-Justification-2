The budget currently being debated "significantly decreases the use of one-time resources."
among the points amstutz raised to defend the gop budget the current budget now being debated significantly decreases the use of resources using
state ron amstutz says the budget now being debated will rely on substantially less money
and as he says the budget eliminates in the second year all money except million
though debate still exists over the exact figure of money used in the last budget cycle the level of money used was unprecedented and is clearly far greater than what is proposed in the new budget
given the republican s rhetoric it might surprise some that they too are relying on such found money to balance the next budget
