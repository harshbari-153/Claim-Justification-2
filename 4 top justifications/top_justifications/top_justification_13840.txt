The Obama administration "borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. ... Maybe in a sense weâ€™re reducing debt."
trump said the obama administration borrowed more than trillion right and yet we picked up
so they borrowed more than trillion right and yet we picked up
that a quarter of the trillion that we owe
assets by more than the trillion that we currently owe
so that wasn t more than trillion and it wasn t double the cumulative debt when he took office
