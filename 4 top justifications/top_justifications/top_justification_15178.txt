Since 2009, "after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent."
are incomes up since
to measure this we looked at the average annual increase in real disposable personal income during three recent periods
in addition even if real disposable personal income is going up over time that doesn t mean it s rising as fast as it once was
pritzker said that since incomes are up nearly percent
so if pritzker s claim about income growth is reasonably accurate how does that jibe with equally accurate claims noting that americans haven t had a raise in years
