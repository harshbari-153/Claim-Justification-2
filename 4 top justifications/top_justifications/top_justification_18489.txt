"In eighth grade math, weâ€™ve fallen to ninth place."
in eighth grade math we fallen to ninth place
but it was misleading to say they had fallen to ninth place
his claim that eighth grade math students in the united states are in ninth place internationally almost certainly comes from the trends in international mathematics and science study a periodic comparison of math and science achievement carried out since by research institutions and government agencies worldwide
eighth graders are in ninth but showing improvement not falling
but the point of his statement was that they had fallen to that position and that mathematics performance in the united states is getting worse relative to other countries
