"President Obama used" his DACA order "to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship."
paxton said president obama used the order creating daca to unilaterally confer u
it s incorrect to say that obama via daca conferred citizenship on anyone
ken paxton makes unfounded claim that barack obama used daca to confer citizenship
press release obama used that dispensation to unilaterally confer u
so what citizenship provision was paxton talking about by email kayleigh lovvorn a spokeswoman for the attorney general s office replied that daca wasn t intended to be a path to citizenship
