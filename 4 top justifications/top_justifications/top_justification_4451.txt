Obama's wife said her goal in life was to put the black community "first and foremost."
the quote about obama wanting to help the black community first and foremost is an actual quote from her senior thesis
but the statement used in the does include the context that obama desire to help the black community first and foremost was leavened by later conservative values such as attending school or getting a job

the thesis titled blacks and the black community was written under her maiden name michelle lavaughn robinson
the then asks what is michelle obama planning to do with her future resources if she first lady that will elevate black over white in america
