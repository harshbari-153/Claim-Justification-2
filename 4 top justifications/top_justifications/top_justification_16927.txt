"My opponent here has accepted money from Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae (and) hosted subprime mortgage seminars."
my opponent here has accepted money from freddie mac fannie mae hosted subprime mortgage seminars and failed to regulate the banks causing the worst housing crisis in our nation s history and causing florida to be at the forefront of these foreclosures
so while it s true that meek accepted money from fannie mae and freddie mac it s not fair to call the forums subprime mortgage seminars
the fannie mae pac for example contributed to meek s campaign in
in fact the fannie mae and freddie mac pacs donated to many other candidates in those election years republican and democrat alike
on a website for the congressional black caucus foundation fannie mae and freddie mac are listed among the group s national sponsors
