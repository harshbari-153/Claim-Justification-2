"It wasn't a big deal when Bill Clinton held up the Bible in front of the same exact church (as Donald Trump)."
a viral facebook post claimed it was a big deal when bill clinton held up the bible in front of the same exact church as donald trump
one defender turned to history to make her case saying it was a big deal when president bill clinton held up the bible in front of the same exact church
did clinton really raise a bible in front of the same church and is the implied similarity between the two images reasonable
no donald trump church photo op was not the same as bill clinton church photo
the caption appeared above a photo of clinton holding a bible in front of a church sign which like the one in trump s photo had white lettering on a black background
