Jim Dunnam "has not lived in the district he represents for years now."
jim dunnam has not lived in the district he represents for years now
republican party says democratic house leader jim dunnam has not lived in his district for years
a broader interpretation would allow for the possibility dunnam hasn t lived exclusively in his house district for years but instead flits between and lives in both houses
is it reasonable to conclude that dunnam lives apart from his wife and children in his homestead residence in falls county or since the midway district requires at least one parent or guardian of a child to live in the district and dunnam and his wife appear to be an intact couple does it make more sense to conclude the family stays mostly at the house near mcgregor in a interview dunnam said he lives in the falls county house which he d earlier said the couple completed about five years ago
after the elections dunnam was sued by his defeated gop foe who said the legislator his wife and children had lived since near mcgregor a waco suburb in a house no longer in the district dunnam represents
