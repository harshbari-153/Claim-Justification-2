doggett said our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students
the former texas supreme court justice went on our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students just as our public schools don t
we did read trauth statement as her saying the university doesn t check the immigration statuses of students

we see an element of truth here in that colleges and universities like public schools don t act as immigration enforcement agents
