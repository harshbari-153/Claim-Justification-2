our ruling biden said that romney and ryan would eliminate the guarantee of medicare
mitt romney and paul ryan biden said would eliminate the guarantee of medicare
joe biden says mitt romney paul ryan would the guarantee of medicare

less clear is whether the operational changes romney would make would undermine the guarantee of benefits under medicare
