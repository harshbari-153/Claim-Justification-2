Gov. Scott Walker bought "80 new, brand-new vehicles" for the state that "we probably donâ€™t need."
vinehout said walker bought new vehicles for the state that we probably don t need
walker did add money to the state budget to buy roughly more vehicles
casting scott walker as a spender democratic kathleen vinehout says walker bought cars that were necessary
so walker s budget authorizes the purchase of vehicles but to this point he hasn t bought any
that memo says the walker administration believes owning more vehicles will mean spending less on leasing vehicles and less on reimbursing state employees for work use of their personal cars
