"You know, we spent $3-million to study the DNA of bears in Montana."
you know we spent to study the dna of bears in montana mccain said at the debate
geological survey is indeed conducting a study that involves the dna of bears in montana but the northern divide grizzly bear project actually has received more earmarked funding than mccain mentions to the tune of
mccain claims in federal money has been used to study the dna of bears and that mostly trueand he clearly is suggesting the study of bear dna is a frivolous use of federal money but we wo argue the merits of the project
and strictly speaking the point of the project is really to analyze the bears dna it to use their dna to take a census
