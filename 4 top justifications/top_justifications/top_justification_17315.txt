"For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes (on gambling), somebody loses $6."
for every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes somebody loses is another way of saying that
van zant said for every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes somebody loses
his argument is that the taxes states receive from gaming revenue is money other people have lost while gambling
that is it s money coming from people already in the state who gamble instead of spending that money elsewhere
charles van zant heights said lawmakers should remember that all gaming revenue is money someone has lost
