"America’s tax code hasn’t been updated in 30 years."
fact america s tax code hasn t been updated in years
ryan said the tax code hasn t been updated in years
is paul ryan right that the federal tax code has not been updated in years
but ryan s claim was the tax code hadn t been updated
if it s been three decades since the tax code was updated that certainly supports his case
