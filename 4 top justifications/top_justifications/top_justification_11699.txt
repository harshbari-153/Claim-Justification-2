Under the new health care law, "the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat. That is called a panel."
but it a major stretch to say that under the new law the first person a patient has to go to is a bureaucrat
we decided to check one specific part of raese statement that under the new health care law the first person a patient has to go to is a bureaucrat
whether its existence supports raese claim that the first person a patient has to go to is a bureaucrat is another matter
that is called a panel
that is called a panel
