"Forty years ago, hardly anybody in the country had health insurance."
gohmert said that years ago hardly anybody in the country had health insurance
for this however we wondered whether gohmert was right that years ago hardly anybody in the country had health insurance
but brian do forget you know years ago hardly anybody in the country had health insurance and this is one of the areas we really need reform in
texas louie gohmert says years ago anybody in the had health insurance
that works out to four out of every five americans under age with private insurance coverage in a far cry from hardly anybody
