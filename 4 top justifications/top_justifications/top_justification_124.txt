Twenty million Americans are "out of work."
marino said on msnbc that million americans are out of work
the idea that million people are out of work in america sounded high especially because the official number of unemployed americans was million as of april according to the bureau of labor statistics
trump said that we have million people out of work
this would mean that upwards of million americans could be described with some justification as out of work involuntarily either fully or partially
still we should note that we didn t intend our calculation to be the final word on how to determine the number of out of work americans
