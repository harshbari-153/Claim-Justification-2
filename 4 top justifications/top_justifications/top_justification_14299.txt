Says taxing more services, taxing retirement income and increasing the flat-rate income tax would "fall disproportionately on the working poor and the middle class."
pritzker said that raising revenue for illinois by taxing more services taxing retirement income and increasing the state s current income tax would fall disproportionately on the working poor and the middle class
the alternative to this plan is doing more of the same namely raising taxes on the middle class
such actions he argued would fall disproportionately on the working poor and the middle class
there are flat tax states that tax retirement income without burdening the poor and middle class
and as pritzker himself once pointed out there may even be ways to wring more revenue from a flat tax system without harming taxpayers of more modest means
