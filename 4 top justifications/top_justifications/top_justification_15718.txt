in criticizing walker sharpton said one school district is so worried about losing state funding that it has stopped giving milk to elementary school kids during snack time
there was a concern that the milk reduced the kids appetite for lunch plus the school board wants to promote the drinking of water which has been substituted for milk at snack time
the newspaper article said the baraboo school district decided to end its practice of providing milk with students morning snack this year citing concerns the state might eliminate subsidies for the program
