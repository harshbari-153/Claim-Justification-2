Says the University of Missouri "has been cleared of involvement" in academic fraud involving student athletes.
hartzler said mu was cleared of involvement in the ncaa case
we decided to take a closer look at the idea that it s wrong to sanction a university which has been cleared of involvement
was mu really cleared of all involvement
but has missouri been cleared of all involvement not in other senses no
it s wrong to penalize today s athletes for the actions of others and wrong to sanction a university which has been cleared of involvement
