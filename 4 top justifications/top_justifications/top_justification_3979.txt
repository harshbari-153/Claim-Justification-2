"Hobby Lobby provided this (birth control) coverage before they decided to drop it to file suit."
hobby lobby provided this coverage before they decided to drop it to file suit which was politically motivated she said
on cnn kohn said hobby lobby provided this coverage before they decided to drop it to file suit
did hobby lobby once provide the birth control coverage it sued the obama administration over
we can t determine if politics motivated the company but we did wonder whether hobby lobby covered the types of birth control at issue in its lawsuit but dropped the coverage before filing its complaint
such coverage is out of step with the rest of the hobby lobby s policies which explicitly exclude contraceptive devices and drugs the company stated in its court filing
