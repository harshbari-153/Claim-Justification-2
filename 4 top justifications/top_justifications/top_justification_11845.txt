Gov. Kim Reynolds, touting $210 million for Iowa broadband, "failed to mention these are actually federal funds approved by Rep. Cindy Axne and signed into law by President Joe Biden."
yesterday reynolds press release touting million in broadband help for iowa failed to mention these are actually federal funds approved by rep cindy axne and signed into law by president joe biden
and while another million for broadband expansion in iowa this fiscal year came from a state contribution that reynolds supported she declined to identify that the new million in broadband money was from the american rescue plan that she opposed
they are correct about reynolds announcing the grants from a program she opposed although iowa has provided some of its own funding for broadband improvements in rural iowa and reynolds has made broadband expansion a state priority
in response democrats ranging from state legislators running for the legislature and party activists said on facebook and social media that reynolds is giving herself credit where credit is not due and accused her of neglecting to tell iowans that the grants she was announcing were funded iowa s allocation of the american rescue plan that they noted reynolds and other iowa republicans opposed
reynolds originally had asked for million annually for each of the next three years but agreed to million saying she could get federal funds to supplement the remaining cost
