The "mega-rich" pay about 15 percent in taxes, while the middle class "fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot."
it s a different story for the middle class typically they fall into the percent and percent income tax brackets and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot
the middle class fall into the percent and percent income tax brackets and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot
the fact we checking here is that the pay income taxes at a rate of percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes while middle class taxpayers fall into the percent and percent income tax brackets and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot
the top income tax rate is percent but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises which makes it difficult to get above
and in fact as buffett says statistics from the internal revenue service show that the wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than percent
