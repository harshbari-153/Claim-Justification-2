we passed the toughest gun control law in the united states of america the safe act cuomo said at the democratic gubernatorial primary debate at hofstra university
cuomo calls the safe act the toughest gun legislation in the country

cuomo has called the safe act the nation s toughest gun control legislation several times since he signed it into law in january
but while the safe act on the whole may be tougher than other states individual gun laws when several other states individual gun laws are taken together they consistently rank higher than new york for toughness
