Multnomah County has faced "11 straight years" of cuts
has multnomah county had to cut for straight years
how then does the county justify the claim that it s had straight years of cuts well it depends on how you think of cuts
this year we face yet another budget deficit it s the straight year of cuts at multnomah county
no doubt the county has had to make cuts over the years maybe in some department every single year but multnomah county also has added programs has expanded programs and has paid more for raises health insurance and increases for much of the past decade
but we can t agree with the chairman s statement that the county has had years of cuts
