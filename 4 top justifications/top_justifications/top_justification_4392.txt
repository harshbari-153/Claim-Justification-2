Says Barack Obama's comments indicate he "believes in redistribution" of wealth.
our ruling to review romney said obama believes in redistribution
in gop vice presidential candidate sarah palin said obama wanted to spread the wealth because of his tax policy and experiment with socialism as president
romney then said he believes in free enterprise not redistribution of wealth
here s the sentence in which obama specifically spoke about redistribution i think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution because i actually believe in redistribution at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody got a shot
obama spoke of redistribution in a way that government can create an even playing field for everyone and encourage competition
