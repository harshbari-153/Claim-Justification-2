"We now have longitudinal data that shows that children born around Superfund sites have dramatically higher rates of birth defects, dramatically higher rates of autism."
we now have longitudinal data that shows that children born around superfund sites have dramatically higher rates of birth defects dramatically higher rates of autism he said
booker is correct in saying data shows that children born near superfund sites have higher rates of birth defects and autism
so the center of his claim there is data that shows children near superfund sites having higher rates of congenital abnormalities and autism does in fact check out
while they support the idea of a link between autism and superfund sites or birth defects and such sites they don t go so far as to support a case for causality
they said it would be very difficult to prove that being born near a superfund site causes kids to be born with birth defects or causes autism
