"I don't describe your plan as amnesty in my ad. I don't call it amnesty."
romney sternly replied i do describe your plan as amnesty in my ad
i do call it amnesty
clearly romney has two ads where mccain plan is described as amnesty
if the message in ads is clear enough press releases for the ads that are posted on romney web site are of references to amnesty
amnesty amnesty amnesty amnesty
