Says thereâ€™s "no wait list" for private school vouchers
nc democrat says there no wait for private school vouchers
there s some talk about a wait list and some suggestion that not every kid who wants a voucher for private schools is able to get one and we need to expand marcus said during the may debate
i was referring to the fact that no children were denied a voucher due to lack of funding as is so often the case with wait lists marcus said in an email
a few years ago we controversially started subsidizing private schools with vouchers
they were blocked from receiving vouchers due to a cap that limits state spending on kindergartners and students as politifact reported in a previous fact check
