SayÂ President Donald Trump "dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article" about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians.
the white house legal document said that trump dictated a short but accurate response to the new york times article about the trump tower meeting with russians
you have received all of the notes communications and testimony indicating that the president dictated a short but accurate response to the new york times article on behalf of his son donald trump jr
but one part of the letter that caught our eye is an assertion about how the white house responded to media disclosures of a june meeting in trump tower between trump campaign officials and russian nationals
was initial trump statement on trump tower meeting accurate as lawyers memo said
the lawyers memo acknowledged that president trump had indeed dictated an initial statement to the new york times
