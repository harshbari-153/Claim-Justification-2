Muslim nations did not "call out" the people who celebrated the 9/11 attacks.
o reilly said that muslim nations did not call out the people who celebrated the attacks
no muslim government out those who celebrated after
again these people are a minority but they were not called out in any official way by muslim nations around the world
so while it s true that governments did not speak out against the jubilant palestinians there was broad rejection of the attacks from officials and top religious leaders
so far as we can tell there was no official condemnation of people celebrating the attacks
