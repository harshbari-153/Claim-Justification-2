"Fiorina's plan would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare."
fiorina plan would mean slashing social security and medicare which would devastate seniors
here we wanted to look at whether fiorina plan would mean slashing social security and medicare which would devastate seniors
fiorina has indicated she would accept some form of cuts to social security and medicare for younger workers but time and again she has refused to be specific and only speaks about curtailing future spending for the programs in vague generalities
we do know that fiorina supports slowing the growth of such programs to rein in government spending but we do know what specific proposals would look like and whether they would constitute slashing
as we reviewed fiorina position on entitlements we could help but notice one thing fiorina is terribly specific about what she thinks entitlement reform should include
