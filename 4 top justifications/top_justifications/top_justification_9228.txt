The White House was dark for 10 nights in a row.
one shows what looks like the original image of the white house taken at night in
night in a row no body home reads the description on an image showing a dark white house nary a lamp shining in the windows
no this photo doesn t show the white house dark after biden was sworn in
while some of the windows are indeed dark one is not and outdoor lights illuminate the exterior of the building
the fake news story said that donald trump had turned off the white house lights to fool fbi agents into thinking no one was home
