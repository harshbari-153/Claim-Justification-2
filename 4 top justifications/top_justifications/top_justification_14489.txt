A "wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation" on gun background checks.
found that percent of those living in a household with an nra member favored background checks for all potential gun buyers
barack obama says a wide majority of nra households supported gun legislation
these results verify that nra members and those who live with them favor universal background checks by margins of between percent and percent
it found that people in nra households overwhelmingly favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks percent favor this proposal while just percent are opposed
so while the polls do demonstrate strong support for background checks a key element of both senate measures it s a bit of a stretch to say that nra members polled supported this legislation
