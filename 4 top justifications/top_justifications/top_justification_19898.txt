"All Citizens Who Want to Receive Gvt Benefits Must Agree to Be Microchipped in the Near Future"
all citizens who want to receive gvt benefits must agree to be microchipped in the near future said a jan
a website claiming to be exposing one truth at a time deceptively says citizens will soon need to be microchipped in order to receive government benefits
the post also said that the idea of using microchips in order to track the financial situations of welfare recipients has already been suggested by one politician in finland
if americans are serious about holding on to our fourth amendment right to privacy then these are questions that we should all demand be answered before more advancements in microchip technology are made the post said
but regardless of how good the intentions may be there are still a lot of questions that must be answered before the people of our country and elsewhere embrace the use of surgically implanted microchips
