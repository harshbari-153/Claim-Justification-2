"POTUS’ economists: ‘Stimulus’ Has Cost $278,000 per job."
this time the claim was president obama s own top economists estimate that the stimulus debacle cost taxpayers an average per job
yet his original item did say taxpayers would have come out billion ahead if the government had simply cut a check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the stimulus so where does that leave boehner s tweet that said potus economists stimulus has cost per job
shortly after noon on july house speaker john boehner s tweeted a july blog posting from the conservative weekly standard s website labeling it potus economists stimulus has cost per job
house speaker john boehner says obama economists figure stimulus cost at per job
republicans made a similar assertion in november using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than per job
