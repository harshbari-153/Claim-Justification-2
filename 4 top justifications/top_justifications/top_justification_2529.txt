McDonald's in England only sells organic milk and free-range eggs, which provides more nutritious offerings than in the U.S.
and so we wondered if oliver was right that mcdonald restaurants in england really only sell organic milk and free range eggs and that by implication they are dramatically different and more healthy than mcdonald restaurants in the united states
first do mcdonald restaurants in england only sell organic milk
mcdonald does not use organic milk
mcdonald uses only eggs while they are not used in the u
as for oliver comment he correct that mcdonald in england uses organic milk
