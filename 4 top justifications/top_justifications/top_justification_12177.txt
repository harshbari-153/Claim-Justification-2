If parents "don't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have (for their children), they will be fined."
now we look at the statement that if they have children that do have health insurance that senator obama wants them to have they will be fined
small business people who have employees without health insurance that he going to fine them if they do have the insurance policy that senator obama wants them to have that if they have children that do have health insurance that senator obama wants them to have they will be fined mccain said
we have a bigger problem with mccain explanation that people get fined if their children d o have health insurance that senator obama wants them to have
obama health plan does have a mandate that children have insurance and it would likely include an eventual fine once all the elements of the health plan are in place
obama wants all children to be insured but he leaves many options through which this could occur
