the government has turned a profit
and while we know that we will not escape the worst financial crisis in decades without some losses to taxpayers it worth noting that in the first round of repayments from these companies the government has actually turned a profit

as for obama claim he is careful to note that the overall program could still cost taxpayers money but he is correct to say the government turned a profit on the first round of repayments
bank analyst bert ely said while the government may end up losing money on investments in some financial firms it likely the entirety of the bank portion of the tarp will ultimately turn a profit
