"The vast majority of the (refugees) coming into Fort McCoy are not the SIVs" and some have "no documentation at all."
testin said the vast majority of the refugees coming into fort mccoy are not the sivs and some have no documentation at all
so is testin right that the vast majority of the refugees coming into fort mccoy are not the sivs and some have no documentation at all
while no official numbers have been released testin s comment was corroborated by two people who attended the briefing and tracks with what is known about the refugees in general and at fort mccoy in particular most do not fall into the siv category
but did some of the refugees arrive with no documentation at all
to be sure the exact number of refugees with and without special immigrant visa applications at fort mccoy and how many have no documents at all has not been publicly released
