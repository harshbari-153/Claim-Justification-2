A 2011 measure passed into law with Wendy Davisâ€™ support "removes from the attorney general the ability to settle lawsuits just like" the school funding case.
abbott said davis voted for a measure that removes the attorney general s ability to settle lawsuits like the school funding case
and that is a law that you voted on and helped pass in that removes from the attorney general the ability to settle lawsuits just like this
did legislators including davis move to keep the attorney general from settling lawsuits
by email david thompson a lawyer representing hundreds of districts in the litigation told us either settlement threshold million or the previous million would be substantially below what it will take to resolve the school finance lawsuit
specifically the law barred the attorney general or any lawyer representing the state from entering into a settlement of a claim without legislative consent or approval
