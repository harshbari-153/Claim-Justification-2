"In almost every state with an income tax, wealthy people pay a higher tax rate than the middle class."
in almost every state with an income tax wealthy people pay a higher tax rate than the middle class a narrator says in the ad as a map highlights the states with graduated income taxes under the banner states with a fair income tax system
think big illinois ad claims that in almost every state with an income tax wealthy people pay a higher tax rate than the middle class
but just because a state applies different rates to different amounts of income doesn t mean only the wealthy pay top rates
so we asked think big illinois what their ad meant when it said almost every state with an income tax applied higher rates to the wealthy given that nine states levy the same tax on everyone and a total of others apply their top rates to all but the poorest
still it d be a tough sell to argue that all taxpayers who pay top rates on some of their income in those states are necessarily wealthy especially depending on family size
