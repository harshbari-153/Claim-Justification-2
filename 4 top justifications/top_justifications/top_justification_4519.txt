The Obama administration’s 2013 Syria proposal "had no clear objective," while Trump’s Syria strike "had a clear strategic objective."
rubio said the obama administration s syria airstrike proposal had no clear objective while trump s syria strike had a clear strategic objective
but we were also interested in rubio s assertion that the obama administration s proposal compared to trump s actions didn t have a clear objective
obama wanted to strike syria in retaliation but he chose to ask congress to authorize his use of military force
our action would be a limited and targeted military action against military targets in syria designed to deter syria use of chemical weapons and degrade the assad regime capabilities to use or transfer such weapons in the future
the second is that the administration what they were proposing had no clear objective
