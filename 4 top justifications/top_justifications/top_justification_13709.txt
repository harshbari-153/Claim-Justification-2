Says DonaldÂ "Trump got, you know, $1.8 billion worth of free media. I got, like, none."
john kasich calls out donald trump billion worth of free media
but could it possibly be that trump has gotten billions in equivalent media coverage and kasich has gotten almost none let s go to the tape
but he said trump had the market cornered on media coverage without spending a dime
part of the reason billionaire donald trump is enjoying such a lead in the gop presidential primary is because he hasn t had to pay much to get his message on the airwaves ohio gov
i have never seen a candidate get as much earned media as trump
