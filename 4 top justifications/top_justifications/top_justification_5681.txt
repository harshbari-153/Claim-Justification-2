McCain and Bush are millionaires who are "for tax cuts for millionaires."
so mccain and bush are both millionaires and that part of the statement is correct
both millionaires mccain supports bush cuts
it true that bush and mccain are both millionaires with mccain being somewhat wealthier
a millionaire who for tax cuts for millionaires
but we concerned that the ad leaves the impression that mccain advocates new additional tax cuts for millionaires rather than keeping the present situation in place
