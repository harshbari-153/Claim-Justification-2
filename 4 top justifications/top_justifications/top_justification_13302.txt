"We [the city of Atlanta] are overbuilt on housing."
atlanta city councilwoman yolanda adrean tossed out one possibility in june when she said on the city s website we are overbuilt on housing
likewise the buckhead condominium market is clearly overbuilt
let s see the unemployment rate is up and credit is tight but does the city have too much housing to the adrean said the statement is based on conversations she s had with friends in the real estate business and articles she s read in the local media including the atlanta
smartnumbers analyst steve palm said the city does have an overabundance of depressed housing
all of it creates a critical mass that spells trouble for the atlanta housing market
