"One percent of the American people make over 21 percent of all the income in America. That wasnâ€™t the way before George Bush became president."
for the first time since the late percent of the american people make over percent of all the income in america
biden cites the number accurately for the amount of income captured by the top percent and he s technically right when he says that wasn t the way before george bush became president
but the percent of income caputured by the top percent has risen fairly steadily for decades and we think it misleading for biden to suggest this disparity did exist before bush
percent of all the income in the united states
percent of all the income in the united states
