Children who witness domestic violence are "twice as likely to commit it themselves."
so saying these kids are twice as likely to commit domestic violence is a little too precise
we were interested in checking klobuchar s claim that kids who witness domestic violence are twice as likely to commit it themselves
klobuchar children who witness domestic violence are twice as likely to commit domestic violence
in other words there s enough out there to suggest that children who witness domestic violence are more likely to perpetrate it but saying something as precise as twice as likely is difficult
but overall even though there s a consensus that witnessing domestic violence puts kids at a greater risk for perpetrating it themselves the precise figures differ
