a facebook video focused on liquid milk said bottling limitations mean grocery stores are short on milk even as farmers are dumping it
are farmers really dumping milk even as grocery stores are short of it and are production limitations on liquid milk to blame
are bottling limitations on liquid milk to blame for milk dumping
milk is being dumped not just because it can t be bottled in the proper way but because the overall demand for all dairy products is down
although grocery store dairy shelves remain sparse dairy farmers are being forced to dump thousands of pounds of milk down the drain says the clip from courtenay dehoff tv
