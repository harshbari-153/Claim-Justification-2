Says the word "Dhimmitude" is on page 107 of the health care law and means "Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance."
have you ever heard of dhimmitude a chain email claims dhimmitude is on page of the health care law and it means muslims will be exempt from the health care law
the email goes on to claim that the health law specifically exempts muslims
muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured
on page of the health care law exempts muslims claims chain email
some call dhimmitude the condition of being subject to muslim rule but the word seems to be a recent coinage of academics and commentators
