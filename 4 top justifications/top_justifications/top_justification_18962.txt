Says J.D. Vance said, "People who voted for Trump voted for him for racist reasons."
the clip that caught our ear was of vance saying people who voted for trump voted for him for racist reasons
vance on video people who voted for trump voted for him for racist reasons
a club for growth action ad said vance had said people who voted for trump voted for him for racist reasons
in the full interview from which those words were drawn vance allowed that some people voted for trump for racist reasons but he said most people voted for trump for his policies on jobs
and definitely some people who voted for trump were racists and they voted for him for racist reasons
