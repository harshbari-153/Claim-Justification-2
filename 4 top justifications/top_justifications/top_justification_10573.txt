"For more than a year, I have been saying that itâ€™s time for Congress to act and begin impeachment proceedings."
o rourke said for more than a year i have been saying that it s time for congress to act and begin impeachment proceedings
how long has said time for congress to act on impeachment
for more than a year i have been saying that it s time for congress to act and begin impeachment proceedings o rourke said before delving into a discussion of special counsel robert mueller s first public appearance since launching his investigation of russian interference in the presidential election
is o rourke right when he says that he has been saying it s time for congress to start impeachment proceedings for more than a year no not really
it s a stretch to suggest that o rourke can simultaneously say he not calling for impeachment while still suggesting that it s time for congress to act
