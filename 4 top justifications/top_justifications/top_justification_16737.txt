my mask will keep someone else safe and their mask will keep me safe said toomey a republican from the lehigh valley
toomey s claim that his homemade mask would keep someone else safe and that someone else s homemade mask would keep him safe matches the latest guidance from the cdc
the mask needs to seal as tightly as possible to the face to avoid leaks though this may not be possible with different designs fabrics or face shapes
and the efficacy of any homemade mask depends on how it s made
the most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and make a tight seal around the wearer s face
