Proposed fees for Rhode Island beaches will still be "less than some of the town beaches."
licht says proposed fees for state beaches are still less than fees at some municipal beaches
on weekends and holidays the state s new fee would be less than fees in of the beach towns
could the fees at state beaches still be lower than town beaches even if doubled when we inquired where licht got his information the governor s spokesman michael trainor told us we d hear back by the next day
still at are less than some of the town beaches charge i don t think that s an inordinate burden on the people of rhode island licht said
so when licht says the new state fees are less than some of the town beaches we can t disagree
