Before the HOPE scholarship, "70 percent of the high school students who made 1400 or above on their SAT left the state of Georgia. Now, 70 percent of those stay in the state of Georgia."
and i think my statistic is correct on this that prior to hope percent of the high school students who made or above on their sat left the state of georgia he said april
seventy percent of those stay in the state of georgia
a presentation by the university system of georgia stated that in percent of georgia s seniors who scored or above enrolled in the system s schools
do students who make or above on their sat stay in georgia at more than twice the rate they did before hope we hunted for the source of deal s information and came up short
even as elected officials cut the beloved hope scholarship they re going out of their way to remind voters they think it s good for georgia and they want it to survive
