Says an EPA permit "languished" under Strickland but his new EPA director got it done in two days.
after receiving comments from the company during the draft period that lasted until the epa revised the final permit twice to try and address their concerns and was ready to issue the final permit during strickland s last week in office hodanbosi wrote
at a news conference on his fifth day in office the republican governor described the air permit as having languished under the previous administration and was incredulous that epa officials had held the darn thing up for over months
he did note that the strickland administration spent months on the permit rather than as the governor said
but given the work that was done during those months and that the company was the roadblock to the permit being completed while strickland was still governor kasich s complaint of a lack of commitment from staffers as the reason for the project taking so long doesn t ring true
but the company balked at some of the language in the permit so it wasn t issued while strickland was in office
