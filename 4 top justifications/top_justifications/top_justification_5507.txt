Ex-AARP members wrote this letter criticizing the "Biden Regime."
a long letter critical of aarp the nonpartisan organization that lobbies on behalf of americans who are and older is circulating on social media and takes aim at president joe biden
old letter edited to take aim at biden
while much of this letter is the same as the millers version it is being shared as if it s a new attack on biden s policies
biden of course served in that administration as vice president but this message has been edited and altered in the years since to mislead readers into believing it is current
the socialist politics practiced by the obama administration and empowered by aarp serves only to raise the blood pressure my medical insurance strives to contain the original letter went on to say
