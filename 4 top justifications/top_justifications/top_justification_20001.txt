"Three years after getting the $100 million (from Mark Zuckerberg), less than two-thirds of students in Cory Booker's Newark graduate."
a super pac s ad criticized mayor booker for newark s low graduation rate three years after zuckerberg donated million to improving the city s education
aside from the question of booker s control over the district the other key part of the ad is whether or not less than of students graduate
my impression is cory booker has backed off a lot from his early more direct engagements in education reform
three years after getting the million less than of students in cory booker newark graduate said a bookerfail video criticizing booker for his inability to improve newark public schools
zuckerberg donated million nearly three years ago to start a foundation for education called the foundation for newark s future
