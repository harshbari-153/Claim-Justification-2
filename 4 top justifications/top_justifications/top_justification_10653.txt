"(Jeb) Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose."
american bridge said bush not the state of florida decided which private emails to disclose
media accounts establish that bush not the state of florida decided which private emails to disclose apparently nothing would have stopped the bush team from selectively leaving out politically problematic emails the american bridge website read
the pac pointed out that bush also had used a private account as governor and had repeatedly defended his own editing of what emails would become part of the florida public record
another big difference is that while clinton was not open about her private email use bush was transparent about the fact that he was using a private account according to first amendment foundation president barbara petersen
does florida s open records law allow bush and all other of the state s elected officials to what emails they make available to the public sure enough it does but there s more to it than just letting politicians emails
