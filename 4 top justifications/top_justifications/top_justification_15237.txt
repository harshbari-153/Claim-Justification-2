"If Biden becomes president and cannot complete his term, Harris will become president, and Pelosi will become vice president."
if democratic presidential nominee joe biden wins the election but can not serve his full term vice presidential nominee kamala harris would assume the role of president and house speaker nancy pelosi would become vice president reads a popular facebook post
so if biden became president and left office early kamala harris would indeed become the new president
if a president biden left office nancy pelosi would not become vice president
but nancy pelosi the speaker of the house wouldn t become vice president
instead harris would choose the new vice president and the house and senate would vote on her choice
