the iranians are now saying that what we saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things
rubio said the iranians are now saying that what we saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things
so we wondered are the united states and iran s descriptions of what the deal will entail so different
but iran and the united states have each produced factsheets about the agreement in addition to a joint statement from the negotiating parties
how can the united states and iran come to a deal on iran s nuclear program when the two countries can t even agree on what they supposedly agreed to
