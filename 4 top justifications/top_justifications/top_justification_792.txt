"Credit agency says Rep. Gibbs recklessly caused downgrade, higher interest rates."
gibbs recklessly caused downgrade higher interest rates
the dccc s statement specifically claims that s p blamed gibbs for recklessly causing the downgrade and raising interest rates
democrats say republican bob gibbs caused the downgrade of the credit rating
regardless we stumble over the dccc line that gibbs can be blamed individually for the downgrade and any of its potential consequences and over the way it gives the freshman legislator equal billing with speaker of the house john boehner
the dccc cited half a dozen sources to back up its assertion that the downgrade of american credit could raise interest rates for consumers
