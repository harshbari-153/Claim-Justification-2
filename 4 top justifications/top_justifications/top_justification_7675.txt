and by reducing iran s heavy water stockpile the purchase helps iran comply with a nuclear agreement that is aimed at making it harder for the country to develop a nuclear weapon
the new controversy stems from the obama administration s announcement on april that it would buy tons of heavy water from iran to help the country meet the terms of the nuclear deal which limits how much heavy water iran can stockpile
moreover the purchase helps keep iran will be in compliance with the part of the nuclear deal that limits how much heavy water iran can stockpile
