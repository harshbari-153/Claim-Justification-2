Says Vice President Joe Biden "admits that the American people are being scammed" with the economic stimulus package.
boehner claims biden said the stimulus is scamming the american people
using biden scammed remark in that context makes it sound like biden was saying the same thing acknowledging that the white house scamming the public by pretending the stimulus spending has been working
but boehner statement suggests biden had a whole other meaning when he talked about being scammed
but boehner incorrectly suggests the vice president called the stimulus a scam and he fails to note that biden promised to expose abuses whenever they were detected as the ap reported
biden was referring to the fact that some people have been lured by con artists who promise big stimulus bucks in return for personal information or a fee
