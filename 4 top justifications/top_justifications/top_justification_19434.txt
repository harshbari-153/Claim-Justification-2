"Not a single banker, a CEO from Wall Street, anyone from corporate America â€” nobody, (there was) not one arrest of any of these people who brought down the economy in 2008."
our ruling moore said not a single banker a ceo from wall street anyone from corporate america nobody there was not one arrest of any of these people who brought down the economy in
here what moore had to say well it highly ironic that now over of the protesters have been arrested and not a single banker a ceo from wall street anyone from corporate america nobody not one arrest of any of these people who brought down the economy in
but we wanted to know if moore and others were right that not a single banker or corporate executive had been arrested
no ceos have been arrested for bringing down the economy said michael moore
but moore larger point is correct there have been very few arrests among executives of firms the public would associate with causing the financial crisis
