"A majority of Americans still oppose this health care bill."
instead he said a majority of americans still oppose this health care bill something that was strictly true in only half the january polls we looked at
in a response to president barack obama state of the union address house minority leader john boehner wrote that a majority of americans still oppose this health care bill
five out of the polls found that a clear majority of respondents opposed the health care bill
boehner says a majority of americans oppose health care bill
so boehner would have been on firm ground if he said that more americans oppose the health care bill than support it
