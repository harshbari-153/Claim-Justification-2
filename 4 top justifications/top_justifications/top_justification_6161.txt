kurt schrader who represents oregon s district wasn t surprised when he saw this recent jab from republican challenger scott bruun schrader cast the deciding vote that failed to extend tax cuts for oregon s families and small businesses
scott bruun says kurt schrader was the deciding vote in not extending tax cuts
bruun takes this to mean that the house read democrats failed to extend tax cuts for oregon s families and small businesses
bruun is clearly trying to equate a vote for adjournment with a vote not to extend tax cuts and that s just not the case
schrader was in the majority
