Says that Wall Street hedge fund managers "pay a lower tax rate than does a sheet metal worker in Parma or a school teacher in Cleveland."
sherrod brown says wall street hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a typical sheet metal worker or a teacher
for example he said they didn t close the tax loopholes for wall street hedge fund managers who pay a lower tax rate than does a sheet metal worker in parma or a school teacher in cleveland
could wealthy wall street investors have a lower tax rate on their compensation than average workers we asked brown office how he supported his remark
but hedge fund managers typically don t pay taxes on their income the same way other americans do as politifact has noted before
hedge fund managers do necessarily pay even percent however
