The federal government is spending $46,000 a year per family (or group of four) and could balance its budget by dropping that to $30,000.
did you know that if the federal government spent on behalf of every family of four or group of four in america that the federal budget would be balanced today they re spending on behalf of every family of four in america today every year
our conclusion neumann said you could balance the federal budget by reducing the amount spent from per family of four to a reduced amount that is in his view still too high
mark neumann says federal government spends a year per family of four
he concluded if that number was is a lot of money if they spent on behalf of every family of four the federal budget would be balanced today
neumann told us that he d like to see federal spending sink even lower than a year per family of four and it can he said if people take more personal responsibility for their lives
