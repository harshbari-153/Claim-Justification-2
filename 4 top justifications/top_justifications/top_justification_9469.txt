"Democrats have now become the party of the [Atlanta] metro area and of blacks."
powell told the washington news publication politico democrats have now become the party of the metro area and of blacks
even more true than powell s assertion that the democratic party is the party of metro areas and blacks is that the republican party is the party of whites
so the democrats are not completely devoid of white voters outside metro areas but as bullock alluded the situation for the party is grim
i will acknowledge many of our democrats are clustered around the larger cities and i think that proves it s not just atlanta but as far as his racial assertion i m not going to get into that
even so he disputed to a mild degree the idea that democrats can only compete in metro districts and disparaged even bringing up the notion that democrats are the party of blacks
