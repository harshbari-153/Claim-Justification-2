history tells us that job growth always lags behind economic growth obama said nov
obama says job growth always lags behind economic growth
bottom line president obama is right when he cautions that employment has lagged behind economic recovery in the past

in the war ii era there have been recessions and after most of them employment lagged a few months behind other improving economic indicators
