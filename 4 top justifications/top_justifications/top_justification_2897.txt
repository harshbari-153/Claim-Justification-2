Another great endorsement! Barrow Journal explains the difference between me and Jody Hice.
another great endorsement barrow journal explains the difference between me and jody hice collins wrote in a june tweet
the surprise is jody hice a former minister and radio talk show host is taking exception to businessman mike collins claim of a newspaper endorsement
the barrow journal feels the same way for its official pages
with all of that in mind it appears collins did refer to an endorsement and link to a newspaper column
hice s campaign has earned an endorsement from georgia right to life
