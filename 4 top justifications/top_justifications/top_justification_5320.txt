"Fringe leftists are now advocating for cow fart bags to capture farts as a way to help prevent ‘global warming.’"
i wish this was a joke but fringe leftist s are now advocating for cow fart bags to capture farts as a way to help prevent global warming
are bags being attached to cows backs in an attempt to fight climate change
but the facebook post doesn t explain any of the details of the studies including the methane s conversion and it incorrectly pegs scientists and researchers as fringe leftists
so yes scientists are attaching backpacks to cows in order to collect their gas burps not flatulence and transform it into renewable energy in an attempt to hamper the levels of methane that the animals release
so while it is certainly related to the fight against climate change the bags in the photo were not attached in order to eliminate bovine methane emissions from the atmosphere but to study the cow s digestive system and measure the impact of its emissions
