During the Reagan administration, "Millions of people were thrown out of work."
and he said millions of people were thrown out of work
michael moore claims in his movie that during the reagan era millions were thrown out of work
the fallout of reagan economic policy he said is that major corporations laid off american workers at the same time they were raking in enormous profits
and failing to note that while saying that millions of people were thrown out of work is misleading
so yes millions of manufacturing workers lost their jobs early in reagan tenure but if you look at the statistics over the entire eight years of the reagan administration the number of manufacturing jobs decreased by just a half million
