Says the national health care law puts federal "bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor."
chris christie says national health care law puts bureaucrats between american citizens and doctors
here we decided to check christie s statement that the law formally called the patient protection and affordable care act or as some call it obamacare puts federal bureaucrats between an american citizen and her doctor
romney said that obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor
while there are significant changes to the health insurance market and incentives and penalties to promote better care that doesn t mean the government is inserting itself in between doctors and patients
but as politifact noted there are concerns among specialists about the legislation s impact specifically in relation to the medicare program
