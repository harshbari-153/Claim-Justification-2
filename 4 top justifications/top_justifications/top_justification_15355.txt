Because of the 2011 debt ceiling fight, "the stock market lost 2,000 points."
schumer said that because of the debt ceiling fight the stock market lost points
the stock market lost points billion was lost by the american people
we wondered whether schumer was right about the stock market losing points
so if you include the aftershocks of the debt ceiling fight schumer is correct that the dow fell by points
if you count the aftermath of the deal that avoided a debt ceiling breach which included a historic downgrade of the united states creditworthiness rating then schumer is right that the dow fell by points
