"When I withdrew in June of 2008, polls were showing that at least 40 percent of my supporters said, oh, they weren't going to support Sen. Obama."
when i withdrew in june of polls were showing that at least percent of my supporters said oh they were going to support sen
clinton said when i withdrew in june of polls were showing that at least percent of my supporters said oh they were going to support sen
so clinton has a point in both polls roughly percent of former clinton supporters backed obama while percent didn t either through a vote for republican nominee john mccain or a vow to do something other than voting for obama
by august polls showed that obama was winning percent to percent of clinton supporters
we found two polls taken in june that asked primary supporters of clinton who they would support with obama as the democratic nominee
