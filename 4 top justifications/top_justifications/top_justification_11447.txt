Says New Jersey is "down nearly 200,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak" and with Gov. Chris Christie "New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment" for 12 consecutive months.
our ruling one new jersey said the state is down nearly jobs from its peak and for consecutive months new jersey has trailed the rest of america when it comes to unemployment
and for consecutive months new jersey has trailed the rest of america when it comes to unemployment
with that job growth is one new jersey right to claim that for consecutive months new jersey has trailed the rest of america when it comes to unemployment that s a reference to the difference between state and national unemployment rates according to one new jersey spokesman joshua henne
plain and simple new jersey lags the nation when it comes to unemployment
new jersey unemployment rate has trailed the national rate for consecutive months not the difference was never statistically significant and it s wrong to pin blame for the state s unemployment problem squarely on christie
