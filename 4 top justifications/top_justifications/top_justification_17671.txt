Says Donald Trump warnedÂ outgoing Ghana President against last-minute job appointments.
a fake news website said that trump had warned the departing president of ghana to avoid making job appointments
under the headline donald trump warns outgoing ghana president the faux article said talking to the new york times trump acknowledged the efforts of john mahama in defending africa s democracy by peacefully conceding defeat in the country s elections
no trump never called departing ghanaian president
the invented quote from trump referred to mahama s appointments for several key jobs in the government
needless to say there is no new york times article quoting trump as saying this nor did a search of the nexis news database uncover any time when trump spoke about ghana
