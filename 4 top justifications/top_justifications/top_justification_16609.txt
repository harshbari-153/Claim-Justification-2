A photo of a deer standing near a burned down residence is from the Australia wildfires.
photo of deer in burned rubble is from california not australia
some of the photos were taken during previous fires in different countries too like this photo of a deer standing amid burned rubble in california
this image is authentic but it does not show destruction from australia s wildfires
after conducting a search we found that the deer image was taken by photographer josh edelson on nov
on its own the viral deer image is uncaptioned
