Vermont had to "scrap" its single-payer health insurance program because it was "going bankrupt."
duffy said vermont had to scrap its health insurance program because it was going bankrupt
vermont was scrapped because it was going bankrupt no it was never implemented
the introduction to a national public radio piece that aired the day before duffy s statement explains it was about why vermont was unable to establish a health care system
in short in vermont didn t go bankrupt it was never even funded or implemented
so it s clear that cost was cited as the reason vermont did not implement even though it was predicted that the tax revenue would have made the program viable
