"The most likely triggering cause of (microcephaly)" is the "DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women."
an online article on the website of the centre for research of globalization said the dtap vaccine is the mostly likely cause of microcephaly in brazil
so is dtap is the most likely triggering cause of microcephaly
in the whole week of reports that i heard or read about not a single interviewer asked about and not a single expert or mainstream journalists ever mentioned the most likely triggering cause of the epidemic and that is the neurotoxic cytotoxic genotoxic aluminum that was in every dtap shot a vaccine that had been recently mandated early in by the brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women and therefore into their fetuses kohls wrote
the weakest part of the argument that tdap plays a role in microcephaly is that pregnant women in the united states and elsewhere have been getting the vaccine and there is no hint of a connection to microcephaly
however the cdc says in some cases microcephaly can occur after the first trimester so in theory a vaccination could overlap with the onset of microcephaly
