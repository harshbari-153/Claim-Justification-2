headline on the website usa snich read pope francis to followers koran and holy bible are the same claiming the pontiff said as much in an hourlong visit with vatican visitors
fake news pope francis did not say the koran and the holy bible are the same
the story said francis told the guests that the religious teachings were equally valid and that the time is ripe for merging our faiths
an obscure website s report that pope francis called the holy texts of islam and christianity the same is actually a fake news story that first appeared two years ago
to be clear we can find no evidence francis ever said such a thing although the story persists on facebook with links tracking back to a variety of websites
