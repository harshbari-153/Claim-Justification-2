House Republicans "weren't part of the negotiations" on the Wall Street bailout plan.
there may be a deal among some democrats but house republicans are not a part of it he said
the same is true on capitol hill where house republicans sank a plan offered by a president from their own party and offered one of their own that would include less taxpayer money
on its face mccain remark clearly is not accurate because republicans were part of the discussion
the public is skeptical of the massive wall street bailout plan pending on capitol hill
and it was the house republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem
