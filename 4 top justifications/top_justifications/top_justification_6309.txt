In the state rankings for ACT test scores, West Virginia "is 30th. Which states are listed in the bottom? 15 states with charter schools."
so the list of states ranking above west virginia is also of charter school states
did states with charter schools cluster below west virginia in act scores
so is romano correct that west virginia ranks in act scores nationally and that every state lower on the rankings has charter schools we took a closer look
rather charter school states are clustering both above and below west virginia in the act rankings
there are lots of states that rank below west virginia but also lots of states that rank above west virginia simply because most states now allow charter schools
