representatives that voted to keep militarizing the police received percent more campaign money from the defense industry than did the representatives who voted to stop it
representatives that voted to keep militarizing the police received percent more campaign money from the defense industry the meme reads
did lawmakers who voted to keep program for police get more in defense cash
that means the no voters received percent more in defense donations than did the yes voters
as we noted the program gives surplus military goods to local and state law enforcement so it s not obvious how the defense industry would benefit from a vote to keep the program alive
