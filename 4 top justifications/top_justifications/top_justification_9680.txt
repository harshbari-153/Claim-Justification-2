"I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment … I signed an executive order so that now ... ministers and and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak. You know, you couldn’t speak politically before, now you can."
we really helped because i gotten rid of the johnson amendment now we are going to go try to get rid of it permanently in congress but i signed an executive order so that now people like you that i want to hear from ministers and and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be they can speak trump said in a july interview with robertson
trump said i gotten rid of the johnson amendment i signed an executive order so that now
so trump s comments to robertson left us wondering if in fact trump had gotten rid of the johnson amendment and if because of his executive order religious leaders were able to speak up politically
the term johnson amendment derives from america s president lyndon b
also the johnson amendment has not been strongly enforced over the years and preachers and pastors have openly challenged it said kraybill the professor at california state
