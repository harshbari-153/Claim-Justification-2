Deaths from vaccines have totaled 1,621 from Johnson & Johnson, 4,799 from Moderna, 13,039 from Pfizer and 73 from unknown vaccines. And this is an undercount because "only 1% of deaths are reported."
an instagram post claims that there have been deaths from the johnson johnson vaccine from moderna from pfizer and from unknown vaccines and claims that this is an undercount because only of people reported deaths
instagram post shared a screenshot showing a number of deaths it attributed to vaccines deaths from johnson johnson deaths from moderna deaths from pfizer and from unknown vaccines
the cdc said in an email to politifact that it hasn t detected any unusual or unexpected patterns for deaths after immunization but did confirm six deaths following the johnson johnson vaccine which resulted from a rare but serious adverse reaction of thrombocytopenia syndrome or blood clotting
a new claim has popped up via instagram that thousands of vaccine deaths reported in vaers are an undercount of an actual number of deaths
to say that a certain number of deaths have been caused by the vaccines is to make assumptions from inconclusive evidence
