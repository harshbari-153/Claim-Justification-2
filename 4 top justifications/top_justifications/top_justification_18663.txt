i don t need a lecture from kirsten gillibrand or anybody else who protected and defended and harbored a sitting president who had sexual relations in the oval office and was impeached for lying conway said on abc s this week
we could find no evidence that gillibrand protected and defended and harbored a sitting president who had sexual relations in the oval office and was impeached for lying
did gillibrand and harbor bill clinton during impeachment as kellyanne conway said
she did not publicly condemn the former president s actions until last year
we could find no evidence suggesting gillibrand publicly defended president clinton while he was in office
