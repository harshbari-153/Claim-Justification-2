a facebook post says the japanese military did not invade the mainland united states after pearl harbor because they know that almost every home had guns and the americans knew how to use them
after pearl harbor did the japanese refrain from invading the mainland united states because they feared there were americans in nearly every home
after pearl harbor japanese did invade us because they feared armed citizens
certainly the japanese were not constrained by the notion that some americans had guns in their homes no one had and other assault weapons at the time added notehelfer an emeritus professor of history at ucla who specializes in the history of japan
remember we had a million man army and war ships in other localities so why did they not invade after the war the remaining japanese generals and admirals were asked that question
