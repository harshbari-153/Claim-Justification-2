tonight in ohio more people came out to vote for barack obama in an unopposed race than voted for romney and santorum combined axelrod told williams
david axelrod says barack obama won more ohio votes than mitt romney rick santorum combined
having a large number of ballots counted early in the evening from cuyahoga would boost obama turnout numbers compared to the republican candidates
he did outpoll them each individually so axelrod would have been correct if he d said that obama won more votes than either romney or santorum
buzzfeed editor ben smith a prominent national political journalist tweeted huh so far more votes for obama in oh tonight than for all republicans who have actual campaigns combined
