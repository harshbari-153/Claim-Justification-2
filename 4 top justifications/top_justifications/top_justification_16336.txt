The intent behind the bill recognizing Juneteenth as a federal holiday "is to replace the Fourth of July."
arguments of divisiveness aside does the bill that recognizes juneteenth as a federal holiday replace or supplant the fourth of july holiday as rosendale and carlson claim
nowhere in the juneteenth national independence day act does it mention replacing the fourth of july federal holiday
i voted against a bill that would make juneteenth national independence day a federal holiday
two days before the nation celebrated juneteenth the bipartisan bill that recognized june as a federal holiday achieved near unanimous passage as it was voted on in the house
rosendale said in a june tweet that the intent of the juneteenth national independence day act is to replace the fourth of july
