Race to the Top grants "require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding."
jolly said race to the top grants require participating states to adopt the common core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding
last year i worked with my colleagues to end funding for federal race to the top grants which require participating states to adopt the common core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding he said on his campaign website
we decided to test jolly s assertion that states had to adopt the common core in order to win federal grants
jolly s assertion is that the application process demanded states adopt common core to get a grant
he noted the timing of the grants during the recession may have potentially spurred some states into action to shore up finances leading them to adopt common core to get a leg up
