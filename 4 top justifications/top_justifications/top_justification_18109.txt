"The Dems demand a photo ID to get a cheeseburger."
the dems demand a photo id to get a cheeseburger but not one to vote
criticizing democratic opposition to voter id requirements murphy said the dems demand a photo id to get a cheeseburger
but there s more than one way to get a cheeseburger and we re not aware of any democrats or businesses withholding them from people who don t produce photo identification
murphy s tweet gives the impression that anyone ordering a cheeseburger will need to show a photo id
so let s set those things aside and focus on the most glaring declaration in murphy s tweet are governments or businesses requesting photo identification from people who want cheeseburgers
