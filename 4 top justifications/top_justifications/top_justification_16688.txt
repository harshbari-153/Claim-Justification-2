"There comes a point in the last year of the president, especially in their second term, where you stop nominating" both Supreme Court justices and Court of Appeals judges.
rubio said there comes a point in the last year of the president especially in their second term where you stop nominating both supreme court justices and court of appeals judges
is it true that presidents stop nominating both supreme court and appellate court judges in their last year in office
do presidents stop nominating judges in final year
but presidents do continue to nominate appellate judges in their final year
out of the last four presidents who served two terms all of them made nominations to the court of appeals as well as the district courts in their last year
