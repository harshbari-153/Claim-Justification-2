"You go down to Miami and when it's flooding at high tide on a sunny day, fish are swimming through the middle of the streets."
obama said you go down to miami and when it flooding at high tide on a sunny day fish are swimming through the middle of the streets
do the fish swim in the streets of miami at high tide as barack obama said in paris
i was in miami last month and fish from the ocean were swimming on some of the streets on a sunny day because it was a high tide
jeb bush was among the skeptics obama said today the streets of miami are flooded and fish are falling on them
so is it a tall tale that fish swim in the streets of miami it s certainly not a regular occurrence
