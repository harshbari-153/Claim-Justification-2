"Pete Buttigieg claims Bible says babies can be aborted ‘up to their first breath.’"
the story includes this context but the headline overreaches by saying pete buttigieg claims bible says babies can be aborted up to their first breath
no pete buttigieg didn t claim the bible says babies can be aborted up to their first breath
com strikes a similar note with a story bearing this headline about a democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg claims bible says babies can be aborted up to their first breath
then again there s a lot of parts of the bible that talk about how life begins with breath and so even that is something that we can interpret differently
we ve previously debunked claims that new york laws make it perfectly legal to murder a baby a minute before it would be born
