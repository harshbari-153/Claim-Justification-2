Michigan and Massachusetts raised their bottle deposit and "could no longer afford the program because the redemptions were so high there was no profit in there."
we have some unintended consequences that may come in with this increase to a dime i would point to a couple states michigan and massachusetts that increased their redemption value and what happened in both of those states is they could no longer afford the program because the redemptions were so high there was no profit in there he told his colleagues
the idea that the bottle redemption program was a way to raise funds and not to encourage recycling just didn t seem right
his reasoning as far as we could tell and he later confirmed was that those states had such high redemption rates the deposit money mostly got refunded and that left the states no money to run their programs
but michigan says that s not the case and massachusetts doesn t even have a higher deposit rate
does the high redemption cause problems is the michigan system going broke at first stanton didn t seem to understand what we were asking
