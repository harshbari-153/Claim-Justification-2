"In 2009, his first year as mayor," Juli√°n Castro "received a seven-figure referral fee" that smells like a dirty financial gift "from notorious personal injury lawyer Mikal Watts, a major Obama donor."
in his first year as mayor castro received a referral fee from notorious personal injury lawyer mikal watts a major obama donor
mackowiak wrote that as mayor castro received a referral fee that smells like a dirty gift from obama donor and lawyer mikal watts
what castro did to earn this fee which smells like a dirty financial gift from a wealthy trial lawyer to a sitting elected official will receive a lot of attention especially since watts was indicted on federal fraud charges in
next we found coverage of the described fee in news stories indicating that castro indeed accepted a sizable referral fee from watts about two years before castro won his first term as mayor
it does say the seed money for castro time in the mayor office he was first elected in was a controversial referral fee that castro a lawyer received from a trial lawyer and democratic donor in a personal injury lawsuit in which castro may or may not have played a major role
