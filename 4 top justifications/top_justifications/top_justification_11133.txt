In February, John McCain "suggested" the Bergdahl-Taliban swap that he now calls "outrageous and dangerous."
maddow mccain was for the bergdahl swap before he was against it
mccain did not propose the swap but said he was ready to entertain it if it led to bergdahl s release
mccain said his opinion back then hinged on details related to guarantees that the taliban officials would not return quickly to the battlefield
mccain well at that time the proposal was that they would release taliban some of them really particularly five really taliban leaders as a measure
it is a mistake and it is putting the lives of american servicemen and women at risk and that to me is unacceptable mccain said at a republican news conference june
