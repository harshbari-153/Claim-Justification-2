"People think AIDS is done -- it’s not done."
people think aids is done it s not done
bono said that the public thinks aids is done it s not done
there an obvious bit of rhetorical flourish in bono comments but independent polling does show that the public sees aids as less of a threat both at home and overseas than it once did
in anthony fauci the head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases said many people think it hiv is no longer a problem
it was not intended to be a literal global comment that all people think the aids crisis is over
