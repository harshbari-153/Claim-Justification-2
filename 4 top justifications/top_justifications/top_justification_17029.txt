vukmir says baldwin is more worried about the mastermind of than supporting trump s nominee for cia director
tammy baldwin have so much more concern for a terrorist compared to the president s nominee to run the cia that she would vote against the nominee
she provided no information to back up an extreme claim that baldwin has serious concern for a terrorist that it is motivating her not to support the nominee
tammy and her party are more interested and they re more worried about the mastermind of the individual that plotted and ultimately killed over americans on our soil
and she s more worried about those individuals than to support a very strong woman with a track record to be the head of the cia
