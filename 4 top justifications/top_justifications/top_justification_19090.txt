The Department of Veterans Affairs has "a manual out there telling our veterans stuff like, 'Are you really of value to your community?' You know, encouraging them to commit suicide."
if you want an example of bad public policy just look at the situation with our veterans where you have a manual out there telling our veterans stuff like you really of value to your community you know encouraging them to commit suicide steele said in a fox news interview on aug
here however we are focusing on steele claim that the manual encourages veterans to commit suicide
in which they state that the your life your choices pamphlet developed by the va more than years ago helps veterans consider the types of health care they would want to receive if they were unable to make decisions for themselves and encourages them to discuss their views with their loved ones and their health care providers and if they so desire to complete an advance directive
rnc chairman michael steele says va has a manual that encourages vets to commit suicide
and we certainly can see how some might think it insensitive to disabled or aged veterans to have a pamphlet with an exercise that poses scenarios such as being in a wheelchair or living in a nursing home and then to even include the option to check a box saying that life like this would be not worth living
