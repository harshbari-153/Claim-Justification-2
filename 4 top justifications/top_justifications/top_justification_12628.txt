Under Obamacare, people who "have a doctor they’ve been seeing for the last 15 or 20 years, they won’t be able to keep going to that doctor."
rubio said that for people who currently have health insurance they have a doctor they ve been seeing for the last or years they won t be able to keep going to that doctor due to obamacare
even without obamacare patients sometimes have to switch doctors
they have a doctor they ve been seeing for the last or years they won t be able to keep going to that doctor he said
rubio ignores the fact that without obamacare patients can lose access to their doctor when their employer switches plans or they switch or lose jobs
will some people find they can t keep their current doctor yes
