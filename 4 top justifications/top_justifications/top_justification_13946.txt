"President Obama . . . wants to mandate circumcision."
he says obama wants to mandate circumcision
z it is president obama who wants to mandate circumcision
given the fact the cdc was pondering the idea back then it is no more accurate to say obama wants to mandate circumcision than to say bush did
limbaugh wrong that obama is mandating circumcision
from what we found obama has not used the word circumcision in any public statement as a candidate or as president
