Air travelers "canâ€™t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check" on them.
i can t get on a plane in the united states without someone doing a background check on me but i could go places in this country and buy a weapon and not have that done
malloy said he can t get on a plane in the united states without someone doing a background check on me while less oversight exists for gun purchases
so what s required of air travelers
we wondered if that s true that air travelers are subject to background checks and how it compares with the requirements on gun purchases
air travelers get background checks but some gun buyers don t says connecticut gov dan malloy
