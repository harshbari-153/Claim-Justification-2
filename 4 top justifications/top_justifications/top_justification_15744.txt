News networks covered Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing live but not Ketanji Brown Jackson’s hearing.
comparing news coverage of confirmation hearings for ketanji brown jackson and brett kavanaugh
we didn t find evidence that coverage of jackson s hearing is wildly out of step with coverage of the usual days of kavanaugh s hearing and it s not true that no news networks are covering her hearing live
day three of supreme court justice brett kavanaugh s confirmation hearing
but comparing jackson s hearing to this day of kavanaugh s is not
but online news coverage from that day is similar to how outlets have reported on jackson s hearing
