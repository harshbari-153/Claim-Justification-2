An increase in Medicare Part B premiums means "America’s seniors are paying the price for Biden’s inflation crisis."
scott said in a press release about the increase in medicare part b premiums that america s seniors are paying the price for biden s inflation crisis
was the climbing annual inflation rate over the past several months to blame for the increase in medicare part b premiums
suggesting that rising general inflation was behind the large increase in next year s standard premiums for medicare part b which covers physician and some drug costs and other outpatient services
medicare part b premiums he said reflect changes in the amount of health services delivered and a more expensive mix of drugs
that measure protects people from seeing a reduction in social security payments caused by higher medicare premiums in years when the adjustment to social security is not enough to cover the premium hike
