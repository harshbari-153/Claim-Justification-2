"Diane Black voted to fund Obamacare."
diane black voted to fund obamacare then she voted to repeal it
but was black really very specifically voting to fund obamacare or was she voting to keep the government from shutting down black has strongly opposed the laws and zelenik s claim is a distortion designed to deliberately mislead voters about black s record
yet zelenik is leaving voters with the impression that diane black has actively voted to fund obamacare said baker who calls such a claim ridiculous
in claiming black has actually voted to fund the health reforms zelenik and her aides point to black s votes on spending measures that continue funding at current levels for all government programs
black is one of cosponsors of that legislation which has not yet received a vote on the house floor
