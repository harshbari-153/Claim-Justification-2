"Mitt Romney has been asked to lead Health and Human Services in Biden administration."
mitt romney has been asked to lead health and human services in biden administration the headline said
mitt romney as his secretary of health and human services is wrong according to a spokesperson for the republican
no joe biden hasn t asked mitt romney to be his health and human services secretary
but searching online we found nothing to corroborate the claims in the post except for a headline from a cbs news affiliate in salt lake city that said mitt romney may be nominated by presumed joe biden to head the hhs
the story went on to say romney is discussing the nomination with his family and is expected to accept the appointment
