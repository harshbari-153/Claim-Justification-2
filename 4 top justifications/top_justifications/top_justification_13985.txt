The federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act bill would create "special protection for pedophiles."
steve king claims federal hate crime law would provide special protection to pedophiles and other sexual deviants
said brian levin director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university san bernardino the assertion that the law is designed in an effort to protect pedophiles is not only without merit it is an affront to anyone who has been a victim of a hate crime
and the hate crime prevention act passed the house
with the federal hate crimes prevention act moving swiftly through congress and president barack obama committed to sign it opponents have ratcheted up their rhetoric and complained about a provision that would add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of hate crime categories
and so i do want special protective status for a pedophile when a regular person would get less lesser protection under this law
