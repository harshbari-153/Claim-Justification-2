"During his tenure in Washington and in the Illinois State Senate, Barack Obama has accumulated a record of bipartisan success."
say obama has been around washington long enough to gain much of a reputation as a legislator
but if it is difficult to evaluate obama work as a senator it is possible to examine his voting record
his record on bipartisanship is split
obama wants voters to believe that he a bipartisan legislator in washington
and while it true that he has bills with gop members and republicans may count him among their friends obama certainly is a loyal democrat when it comes to voting on legislation
