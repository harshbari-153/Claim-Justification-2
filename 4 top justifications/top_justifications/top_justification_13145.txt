"Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument."
paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office
dillon a lawyer for trump said under the constitution paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office
so paying a hotel to offer standard hotel services is not an emolument because the service provided is not associated with the office of a president
it s not about business deals like staying in hotels when the price is fixed
what that means is someone holding a government position can not take an emolument meaning payment or salary from a foreign government
