Says Mitt Romney supports cap and trade.
rick santorum ad says mitt romney favors cap and trade
it is consistent with what we said in our original story above that romney had expressed some support for cap and trade but backed away from it when he declined to sign on to a regional cap and trade pact
while romney appears to have favored cap and trade in the past his actions as governor better prove his skepticism of the policy than his support for it
we think that s good evidence that romney once held at least cautious support for cap and trade
romney s campaign sent us several of his past statements on cap and trade
