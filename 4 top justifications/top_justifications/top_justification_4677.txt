"Ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV."
the problem is partly the result of another one she said ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the bmv
ohio clearly in some cases is using address updates to its driver license database to update voter registration addresses
ohio rate of registrations and registration updates from bmv transactions is far lower than the national average
instead she said the statement was based on the proof that voter registration updating is not offered during online bmv transactions
rather she said ohio is not meeting a legal obligation
