Says Joe Biden and Gretchen Whitmer were maskless at the Detroit Athletic Club "while OUR children are being mandated to wear a mask while playing outdoor sports."
while our children are being mandated to wear a mask while playing outdoor sports these hypocrites are at the detroit athletic club yesterday maskless reads the description of an image that shows biden and whitmer standing in close proximity to other people and not wearing masks
biden and whitmer are wearing the same outfits in that photo as they were photographed in during a campaign rally in detroit that same day
archer doesn t say in the post when or where the photo was taken but they re at the detroit athletic club where biden attended a fundraiser on march
on april more than a month after biden s campaign rally whitmer signed an executive order requiring people to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces
photo of biden and whitmer was taken before cases emerged in michigan
