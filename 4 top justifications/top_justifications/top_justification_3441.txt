"(President Barack Obama) said unemployment was never gonna go over 8 percent if we passed the stimulus plan."
our ruling during his face the nation interview christie repeated the gop talking point that obama said unemployment was never gon na go over percent if we passed the stimulus plan
chris christie claims obama said unemployment would never top percent if the stimulus was passed
but with one of those answers christie rehashed an old and mostly inaccurate gop talking point about president barack obama guaranteeing that the stimulus program would keep unemployment below percent
he said unemployment was never gon na go over percent if we passed the stimulus plan christie told schieffer
but politifact has never found evidence of an administration official making a public pledge to hold unemployment below percent
