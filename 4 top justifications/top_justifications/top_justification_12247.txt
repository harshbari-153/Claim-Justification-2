A new Republican litmus test "would have resulted in (the GOP) kicking out Ronald Reagan."
olbermann says proposed gop litmus test would freeze out reagan
olbermann told viewers that the resolution which invoked the name of former president ronald reagan six times in its preamble would have effectively blackballed reagan himself had it been in place during his political career
so on this item too both sides can pick and choose their evidence to show that reagan did or did adhere to republican fiscal orthodoxy
that leaves three issues to determine whether olbermann is right that reagan would have been denied gop funding
so during the remainder of his political career reagan used his bully pulpit aggressively to oppose abortion
