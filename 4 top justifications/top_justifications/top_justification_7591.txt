Says Goldman Sachs CEO said Congress would "have to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations."
two years ago the ceo of goldman sachs who himself is a billionaire came to washington and said you know what you in congress are going to have to cut social security medicare and medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations sanders said
democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders told an audience in keene that the ceo of goldman sachs said that congress would have to cut social security medicare and medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations
goldman s ceo lloyd blankfein did call for slowing the growth of entitlement spending which may or may not legitimately be called a cut
but what about the senator s claim that the executive warned of the need for entitlement program cuts and tax breaks for the wealthy
the ceo also supported lowering corporate taxes though sanders leaves out that he also said taxes would likely need to be raised on the wealthiest people to create more revenue
