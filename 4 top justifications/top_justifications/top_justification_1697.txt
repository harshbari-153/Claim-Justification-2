"The Republican governor who stood up and cut spending instead of raising taxes."
we find his claim that he cut spending instead of raising taxes to be only half of the story about how he dealt with the state financial crisisas governor of massachusetts elected in romney inherited a state budget shortfall
and it true that the budget problem was fixed without raising state income taxes
this claim depends on your definition of a tax increase
but romney closed loopholes in the corporate income tax which effectively increased taxes for some companies
