Obama ad contends that John McCain endorses Rush Limbaugh's comments about immigration.
limbaugh took some time to discuss the obama campaign ad and it sure didn t sound like he d forgotten mccain s previous efforts
limbaugh and other conservatives derided mccain s efforts to forge a compromise immigration plan in the senate that combined border security and enforcement to root out undocumented employees with a guest worker program for most of the illegal immigrants in the country
limbaugh called the plan amnesty as did some of mccain s opponents during the republican primary
anyway these relatively minor points raised by the obama campaign are overshadowed by the larger import of the tv ad which attempts to link mccain to seemingly racially insensitive remarks by rush limbaugh
the whole thing raises the question what are quotes from limbaugh doing in an attack ad against mccain especially one that highlights immigration
