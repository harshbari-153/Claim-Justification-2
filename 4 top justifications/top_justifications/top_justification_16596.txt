"According to The Book of Revelations the anti-christ ... will be a man, in his 40s, of MUSLIM descent ... is it OBAMA??"
not to mention the fact that obama is not a muslim
so it this part of the where it says the antichrist will be a man of muslim descent that our religious scholars find particularly ridiculous
the reads according to the book of revelations the is the will be a man in his of muslim descent who will deceive the nations with persuasive language and have a massive appeal
the prophecy says that people will flock to him and he will promise false hope and world peace and when he is in power will destroy everything is it obama
and judging by hits on a google search for obama antichrist the suggestion certainly has spread
