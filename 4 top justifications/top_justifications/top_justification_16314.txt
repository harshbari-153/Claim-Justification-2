"House Republicans pledged to introduce a bill to reform Americaâ€™s health care system," but "the 'party of no' has . . . failed to produce legislation."
he contends that the republicans pledged to introduce a bill to reform america s health care system but have failed to do so
the latest complaint from house democratic leaders is that republicans have failed to produce an alternative to the five major health care bills circulating in congress
but neither that bill nor the others from republicans has emerged as the republican alternative
when we say that the republicans do have a bill it because they said they would have an alternative bill backed by the party
but he right that the republicans have not rallied behind a single bill the way they suggested back in june
