As a senator, Barack Obama supported "an amendment that basically gutted the legal temporary worker program."
he said that barack obama supported an amendment that basically gutted the legal temporary worker program
mccain phrases his statement a little awkwardly but we wanted to know if it was true that obama supported amendments that would have derailed the temporary worker program
clearly obama did vote for a bill that would have curtailed the legal temporary worker program an important part of comprehensive immigration package
why have you backed away from comprehensive immigration reform which you spoke so passionately about in and mccain responded i do enjoy bringing this up but the fact is obama supported amendments which would have gutted the proposal that we had before the united states senate which he said he would propose an amendment that basically gutted the legal temporary worker program
back then he said obama voted for and even sponsored amendments that were intended to kill the immigration overhaul legislation
