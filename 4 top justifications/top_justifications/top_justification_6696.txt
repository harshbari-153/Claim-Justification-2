"Another one he should veto is the SCHIP program, which he should say 'Take the C out of, because now it's for everybody, like every other entitlement program.'"
the schip bill that bush vetoed would cover more people than before but it certainly would cover everybodyargues that president bush was correct to veto legislation to expand the state children health insurance program because it would allow everybody to enroll
if everybody qualified for schip and mccain says there would be no need for private health insurance americans would be taking home more money in their paychecks because they would have to pay premiums and the federal government would be bankrupt
mccain trips on word everybody
the american heritage dictionary defines everybody as every person
