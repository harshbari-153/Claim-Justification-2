Says television host Steve Harvey authored a pro-Trump rant about raccoons and exterminators.
a viral facebook rant that likens president donald trump to an exterminator and undocumented immigrants to raccoons is being attributed to radio personality and television host steve harvey
best we can tell the attribution to harvey started in when a different man named you guessed it steve harvey posted it on his facebook page
no tv host steve harvey didn t write a viral raccoon analogy
the rant talks about a man finding an infestation of raccoons in his basement
we recently came across one post that s been shared over times titled how i feel about trump with a large photo of harvey
