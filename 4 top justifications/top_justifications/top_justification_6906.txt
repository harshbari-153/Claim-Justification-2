"The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they're in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they're in saltwater."
then there my favorite example the interior department is in charge of salmon while they in freshwater but the commerce department handles them when they in saltwater
but fish and wildlife in the interior department does have authority over fish when they in freshwater and the national marine fisheries service in the department of commerce regulates them in saltwater
obama says the one department regulates salmon in freshwater and another regulates them in saltwater
but broadly speaking they a organization in terms of sustainability in ruling on obama statement we found that he right about the regulatory division on salmon with different agencies responsible for the fish when they in freshwater versus when they in saltwater
it is a stretch to say that salmon in freshwater are regulated by the interior department said ray hilborn a professor at the university of washington school of aquatic and fishery sciences
