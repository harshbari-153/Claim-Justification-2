An Environmental Protection Agency regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, regulates dust.
the epa does regulate dust under the clean air act
dust the epa will start regulating dust in january we contacted the cain camp for evidence but they didn t reply
we found that the epa has long regulated a category of air pollution called particulate matter which includes dust
so to sum up the epa has been regulating large particulate matter including dust for four decades but does not single out farm dust or require monitoring in more rural areas
house committee on agriculture in march that it was a mischaracterization that the epa is trying to expand regulation of dust from farms
