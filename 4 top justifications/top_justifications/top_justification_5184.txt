"A construction worker who’s making $50 or $60 grand a year shouldn’t be paying higher tax rates than the guy who’s making $50 million a year. And that’s how it’s working right now."
during the speech obama said that a construction worker who s making or grand a year shouldn t be paying higher tax rates than the guy who s making million a year
so it s certainly possible that a given construction worker pays a higher effective tax rate than a given million earner but it s also not a guarantee
it is wrong that in the united states of america a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker who earns should pay higher tax rates than somebody pulling in million
our ruling obama has made a sweeping statement that it s common even typical for a construction worker to pay a higher tax rate than someone earning million a year
adding these to the percentages we previously found for the income tax alone produces a new final rate of to percent for the construction worker and to percent for the million earner
