"There's no real evidence in the last 20 years that" growth from tax cuts has made up lost revenue.
foroohar said there no real evidence in the last years that growth from tax cuts has made up lost revenue
neither the modern historical record using fair benchmarks nor government analyses we looked at supported the claim that tax cuts create enough growth to eventually offset lost revenue
on the contrary there s evidence that tax cuts may actually hinder economic growth
while tax cuts don t pay for themselves fully tax cuts can generate some growth
do tax cuts pay for themselves evidence is thin
