"I never called for a partition" of Iraq.
joe biden says he never called for partition of iraq
biden responded by taking issue with the word partition which was often used to describe biden plan at the time saying it was never about breaking iraq into three separate countries
and so we decided to check his claim that he never called for a partition
i do want to debate history here but i never called for a partition biden said
and that was never biden plan
