"(Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee."
he obama did accept donations from lobbyists and pacs and he spent money in this campaign from that through his political action committee bill clinton said
but we checking clinton claim that obama did accept donations from lobbyists and pacs and he spent money in this campaign from that through his political action committee
and obama leadership pac did accept from lobbyists and another from pacs even though it was collected before obama was an announced candidate
so obama leadership pac did raise money from lobbyists and pacs though it amounted to just a fraction of the total fundraising
politifact has already weighed in on obama campaign pledge not to take money from lobbyists or pacs finding that while he has eschewed money from federally registered lobbyists he has accepted thousands from people who work for lobbying firms
