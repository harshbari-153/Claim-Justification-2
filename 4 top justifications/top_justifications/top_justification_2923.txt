the firefighters the policemen and others who supported him in his election bid well guess what they do have to worry about their collective bargaining rights
our next question was are these the groups who supported him in his election bid during the campaign last november leaders of the milwaukee professional firefighters association and milwaukee police association appeared in an ad supporting walker and blasting his opponent democrat tom barrett
brazile said the firefighters the policemen and others who supported wisconsin gov
it s true that walker won the endorsement of milwaukee police and firefighter organizations and they won t lose collective bargaining rights if walker s proposal succeeds
but not all unions supported walker
