Says Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez "declared that she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes."
abbott said hernandez declared that she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes
still did hernandez declare that she wouldn t detain known criminals accused of violent crimes as abbott said
let s look at the wording of the policy then gauge whether as abbott said hernandez was saying she wouldn t detain known criminals charged with violent acts
you could read the governor to have said that hernandez who was sworn in as sheriff in january put in place rules against keeping convicts accused of violent crimes behind bars a broad unsupported charge given that the county continues to prosecute crimes of all kinds
three days earlier the referenced sheriff sally hernandez issued a statement suggesting that while sb wouldn t enhance public safety she go along while i hate seeing a state law like this come to pass hernandez said i have always followed the law and that will not change
