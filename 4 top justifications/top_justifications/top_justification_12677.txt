"The Wawa Welcome America festival (features) . . . America's largest free concert."
wawa welcome america the largest free concert in the usa really
the original claim in wawa and welcome america s press release stated wawa welcome america features america s largest free concert
however none of these criteria were included in the original statement which just claimed wawa welcome america features the largest free concert in the country not just on the fourth of july and not based on the diversity of performers or the length of the live concert or whether the view of the stage is continually unobstructed
in a separate email sole added quite a few more qualifiers to the initial statement asserting that the wawa welcome america concert is the longest diverse inclusive free live concert event on july day
philadelphia can certainly claim it has a pretty huge independence day celebration but wawa welcome america is definitely not the largest free concert in the united states
