"As long as I have served . . . This is the first time every single solitary decision has required 60 senators."
this is the first time every single solitary decision has required senators

we going to check the second part of biden statement that this is the first time in his political career that every decision in the senate has required votes
biden says every senate decision now requires votes
but first some senate history
