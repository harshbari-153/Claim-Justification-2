More Hispanics "have been elected statewide (in Texas) on the Republican ticket than on the Democratic ticket."
email blast that the court seems to fail to take into account the fact that more hispanics have been elected statewide on the republican ticket than on the democratic ticket
texas gop chair says more hispanics have won statewide office on the republican ticket than as democratic nominees
so have republicans elected more hispanics to statewide office refresher there are statewide elected posts two u
also texas democrats have nominated multiple latinos for statewide posts who went on to lose in great part because republicans have won every statewide contest since
conversely democrats weren t electing many hispanics when they dominated texas politics either
