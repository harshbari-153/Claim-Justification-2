Says Ady Barkan asked Joe Biden, "Do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding for police?"
scalise s video spliced barkan s words to make it seem like he asked if biden agreed that we can redirect some of the funding for police
as biden continued explaining his proposals for police reform barkan interjected but do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding
scalise shared a video that said barkan asked biden do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding for police
it also shows that despite what scalise s video suggests barkan never asked do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding for police scalise s video which can be viewed via the internet archive spliced two of barkan s questions together
the questions came as barkan proposed redirecting some police funds to social services
