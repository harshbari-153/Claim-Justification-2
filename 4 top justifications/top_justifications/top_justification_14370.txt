atlanta streetcar projected to be jobs boon
under the header new jobs created by the streetcar project it said the line would generate jobs to build and run it and an additional when it spurs economic development in surrounding neighborhoods
so you could say running the streetcar would create jobs that would last years
so even though the newsletter said that running the streetcar would create jobs that doesn t mean transit officials plan to fill positions to run it
but that doesn t mean people are projected to build the streetcar line and they won t all be jobs for atlantans
