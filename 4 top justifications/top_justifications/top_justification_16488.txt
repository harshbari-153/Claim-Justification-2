Says John Boehner "admits 'we are not going to be any different than weâ€™ve been' " by returning to "the same failed economic policies" that "wrecked our economy."
but it a gross mischaracterization to make that point by touting boehner comment and saying that he was referring to economic policy
the post included an video clip in which boehner says and the point we make in this preamble to our pledge is that we not going to be any different than we been
post on pelosi gavel blog said answering a question this morning about the preamble to the gop s pledge to america house republican leader john boehner admitted to american workers their families and small businesses are not going to be any different than we ve been
nancy pelosi cites john boehner in saying gop plans return to old economic policies
so boehner was not in fact talking about the party economic policies
