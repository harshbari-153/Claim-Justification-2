The Senate version of the health care reform bill "allows taxpayer money to pay directly for abortion in federal community health centers funded in the bill."
lipinski says senate bill allows money to pay directly for abortion at community health centers
family research council president tony perkins said the senate bill includes federal funding for community health centers that could be used directly to kill unborn babies
in the senate health bill however the additional billion for community health centers would be dedicated read guaranteed funding for five years and would be administered directly through hhs
given all that and the public pronouncements from the white house the congressional caucus and sebelius that the money could not be used to provide abortions we think it highly misleading to state definitively as lipinski did that if the senate bill passes then federal dollars will start flowing to community health centers to provide abortions
could the money be used for abortions it does seem likely based on the comments from the white house sebelius the congressional caucus and the umbrella organization for community health centers
