Says that "you canâ€™t destroy the guns purchased in a (gun) buyback program as the city (of Memphis) wants to do."
as i recalled you can t destroy the guns purchased in a gun buy program as the city wants to do
i don t think they can do that campfield wrote in his first blog post on the gas for guns program adding that point of this post is that the city is saying they intend on destroying the guns they buy
i may be wrong but didn t we change the law to say they have to resell the guns now the senator cited the tennessee legislature passing a bill in regarding what local law enforcement can do with guns but acknowledged he might be wrong with exactly whether it applied to gun buyback programs similar to the memphis initiative
campfield claimed memphis can t destroy guns from buyback program
the law goes on to say how the gun must be sold a public auction or through a private gun dealer
