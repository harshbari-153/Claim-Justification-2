"Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President ObamaÂ took his oath of office less than eight years ago."
two million more latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office less than eight years ago
trump said two million more latinos are in poverty today than when the president took his oath of office less than eight years ago
literally about two million more hispanic people are living in poverty than in the year leading up to obama s inauguration
there s a lot to unpack there but given trump s attention to immigration from mexico we decided to focus on his claim that million more latinos are in poverty than when obama took office
so the implication of trump s statement that poverty among hispanics has grown significantly under obama is incorrect
