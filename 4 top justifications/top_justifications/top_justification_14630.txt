Says it’s "an old wives’ story" that Margaret Thatcher told George H.W. Bush not to go wobbly.
and never ever will it be said that margaret thatcher went wobbly
but the popular account of her admonition that this is no time to go wobbly has taken on a life of its own one doesn t match bush and thatcher s accounts
dick cheney disputes margaret thatcher s famous no time to go wobbly quote
van susteren but there that famous quote where apparently she told president bush not to go wobbly
but bush and thatcher themselves recount a phone call near the end of august in which thatcher admonishes this is no time to go wobbly
