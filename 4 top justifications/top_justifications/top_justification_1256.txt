a facebook post claimed biden s order stopping the keystone xl pipeline made oil more expensive for us to use
it just made oil more expensive for us to use

but what about the impact over time we talked to several experts to gauge what effect biden s order might have on future prices consumers pay for refined oil products like gasoline diesel or heating oil
does his executive order also make oil more costly for average americans
