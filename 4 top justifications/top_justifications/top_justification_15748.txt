Inside the stimulus package "is anti-Christian legislation that will stop churches from using public schools for meeting on Sundays, as well as Boy Scouts and student Bible study groups."
in fact buried inside obama stimulus package is legislation that will stop churches from using public schools for meeting on sundays as well as boy scouts and student bible study groups gingrich wrote
in short we have seen anything that supports gingrich claim that the stimulus will stop church groups from meeting at public schools nor boy scouts or bible study groups
the new aspect of gingrich claim is that the stimulus language would affect church groups that meet in public schools and that the boy scouts would be considered an excluded religious group
jim demint of south carolina that the language would stop students from having prayer groups or bible studies in their dorms
her group opposes allowing church groups to meet in public schools but it is legal she said
