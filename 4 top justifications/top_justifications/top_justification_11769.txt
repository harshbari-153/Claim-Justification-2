People who "have recovered (from COVID-19) have very strong immunity."
the ones that have recovered have very strong immunity desantis said sept
the studies are preliminary but they do find that surviving leaves people with robust immunity even stronger than immunity gained through vaccination
but for now there s reasonable evidence that someone who recovered from the virus has protection that s at least as good as that from a vaccine
we lack a clear picture on the variation among people in the strength of natural immunity and how long it lasts especially as variants emerge
but researchers also see some signs that the best protection comes from a punch of natural immunity plus one dose of vaccine
