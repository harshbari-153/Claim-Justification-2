Baby boomers didnâ€™t have autism, seizures, allergies and other ailments when they were kids.
autism allergies and other diseases and disorders afflicted baby boomers too
autism is being diagnosed more today than in previous generations but it wasn t foreign to the baby boomers
cancer did not skip the baby boomer generation when they were children
we accepted a challenge put forth by a recent facebook post suggesting that children today suffer from more diseases than baby boomers did when they were kids
this post wrongly suggests that baby boomers only suffered measles mumps and chickenpox while children today endure a slew of new ailments
