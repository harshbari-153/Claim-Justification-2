Microsoft and Bill Gates created a 1999 video game called "Omikron."
social media posts claim microsoft and bill gates created a video game called omikron
now social media posts claim that microsoft bill gates created a video game named you guessed it omikron back in
no microsoft and bill gates didn t develop a video game called omikron in
a real game called omikron was available on microsoft in but neither gates nor microsoft created it and it had nothing to do with the pandemic as these posts suggest
omikron was the name of a video game by microsoft and bill gates about demons pretending to be humans and harvesting their souls
