joe i keep hearing you every morning talking about the biggest tax increase in history but you do mention it also the biggest tax cut in history durbin responded we have almost billion in tax cuts
in this one we tackle durbin claim that the bill is also the biggest tax cut in history
to sum up when durbin said the bill is also the biggest tax cut in history it based first on the contentious assumption that tax credits to help lower income people buy insurance on the exchange can be called tax cuts
but more than that if you look at the net effect the bill is a tax increase
it wrong in both directions ahern said of claims that the health care bill is either the largest tax cut or tax increase in history
