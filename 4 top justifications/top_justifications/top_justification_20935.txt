"California State Assembly bill would ban the (sale of the) Bible!"
the oath keepers group said that a california law would ban the sale of the bible
california state assembly bill would ban the bible said the april headline on the oath keepers website
but in the video interview that went along with the post the oath keeper host asked would this prohibit the sale of the bible we re checking whether the law would ban the sale of the holy book
it is virtually impossible that california will immediately attempt to ban the sale of the bible itself wrote robert gagnon in the federalist
no california bill would not ban bible sales
