Says Romney wrote in the first edition of his book that his health care plan should be expanded nationwide and then, "You took it out of your book."
rick perry attacked romney saying that in his book no apology romney called the massachusetts health care reform he enacted a model for the nation and said that he deleted the passage from the paperback version
now santorum has said it was in your book that it should be for everybody and added that romney took the assertion out in a later edition
as a matter of fact between books your hard copy book you said it was exactly what the american people needed to have that romneycare given to them as you had in massachusetts
his hardcover was written when the national health care policy supported by president barack obama included a public insurance option
when poliltifact looked at the section of the hardback from which the quote came we found that romney was not really saying it was exactly what the american people needed to have that romneycare given to them
