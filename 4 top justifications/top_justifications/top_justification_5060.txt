The Obama administration is "cutting back on defense"
hannity says obama is cutting back on defense
for this item we focus on just one of hannity assertions that obama is cutting back on defense
by some measurements including defense spending as a percentage of gdp hannity is right that obama is cutting defense
again using this factor hannity would be wrong to say that obama is cutting defense
in our view the cutting of specific weapons programs does count as cutting back on defense as long as the defense budget is increasing as a whole
