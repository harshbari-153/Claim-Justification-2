no you can t get free baby formula from your state by calling these numbers

the post gives genuine customer services numbers for enfamil and similac two baby formula brands but a spokesperson for abbott the maker of similac told us this isn t true
while the infant formula shortage persists in the united states some parents may be looking for alternative means to get food for their babies
but don t waste your time in a customer service phone tree to try to get free formula from your state
