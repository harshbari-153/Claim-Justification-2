Rhode Island spends less than 10 percent of what the average state spends promoting tourism.
the rhode island spends is in fact less than percent of that
when brodeur says that rhode island spends less than percent of what the average state spends promoting tourism that true only if you ignore each state population
tourism director says rhode island spends just percent of average to promote tourism
but in the end brodeur broader point that compared with other states rhode island spends very little promoting tourism is correct especially when you take into consideration the fact that rhode island tourism office had a budget of nearly million in
it reports that rhode island ranked out of states when it came to spending money on tourism promotion
