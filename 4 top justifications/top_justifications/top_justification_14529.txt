Says President Donald Trump is "talking about exterminating Latinos."
donald trump did talk about exterminating latinos
wallace said trump is talking about exterminating latinos
while trump hasn t called for exterminating latinos he has made frequent use of the words invasion and infestation to decry the flow of immigrants across the southern border
but while trump has spoken often of an invasion at the border he has not been talking about exterminating latinos as msnbc anchor nicolle wallace falsely claimed aug
i misspoke about trump calling for an extermination of latinos
