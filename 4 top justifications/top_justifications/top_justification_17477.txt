Gina Raimondo "paid 70 million in taxpayer dollars to millionaire hedge fund managers."
allan fung says gina raimondo paid millionaire hedge fund managers million in taxpayer money
she paid million in taxpayer dollars to millionaire hedge fund managers the commercial states
a tv commercial for allan fung says that gina raimondo paid million in taxpayer money to cover fees to hedge fund managers
the commercial cites contributions raimondo received from donors in the financial services industry and also says she used state pension money to invest heavily and the commercial suggests unwisely in hedge funds
finally the commercial s claim that raimondo herself paid taxpayer money to hedge fund managers is misleading at best
