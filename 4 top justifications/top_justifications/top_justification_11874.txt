"We've doubled our use of renewable energy."
our ruling in his two speeches obama said we doubled our use of renewable energy
we wondered whether obama was correct that we ve doubled our use of renewable energy
barack obama says we doubled our use of renewable energy

so to use obama s words did renewable energy not just electricity double between and no
