Says the Ohio Consumersâ€™ Council office employs 74 lawyers and that the funding them is wasteful duplication.
is that duplicative is it wasteful and i think since the legislature was busy with an axe on everything else it makes it pretty hard to sell having the duplication or having lawyers
furthermore his complaint about duplication of services and wasteful spending when the state is busy with an axe on everything is misleading because funding for the ohio consumers counsel doesn t come from general tax revenues
ohio house speaker william batchelder says the consumers council office has lawyers on staff
and the number itself is so overstated that it ecllipses the total staffing level of the consumers counsel office
absent a dramatic reversal the office of the ohio consumers counsel will be classified a budget loser once lawmakers finalize the state s spending plan in the coming weeks
