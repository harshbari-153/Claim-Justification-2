our ruling gary sasse said that among six rhode island programs worth about million three companies got percent of that cvs and two companies not even located in the state of rhode island
ninety percent of the tax credits were going to cvs and two california companies we went to the division of taxation website and found the report sasse was talking about
the credit can help production companies reduce their rhode island taxes
more often those companies can raise money by selling unused tax credits typically through brokers to companies or individuals that owe rhode island taxes but have nothing to do with the entertainment business
