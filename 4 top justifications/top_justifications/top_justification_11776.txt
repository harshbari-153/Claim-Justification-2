Obama "wants a windfall profits tax on oil to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas."
he wants a windfall profits tax on oil to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas mccain said in a june speech in houston
yes obama wants to tax windfall profits
as for the other part of mccain claim that obama wants new taxes for coal and natural gas the details are more sketchy
indeed mccain is right that obama supports a windfall profits tax which would be levied on oil companies to capture some of their profits from rising prices
but regardless obama said what he said what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas
