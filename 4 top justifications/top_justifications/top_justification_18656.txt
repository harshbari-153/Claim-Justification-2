"Across the state the rejection rate for ballots went way down" in the Nov. 3 election.

across the state the rejection rate for ballots went way down because so much work and so much care was taken both by voters themselves and clerks around the state wikler said
is his claim that the rejection rate for ballots is down correct let s take a look
by looking at the rejected ballot rate compared with the improved april rate there is a possibility the rejection will also be down for november but there is no data yet to confirm that
however there is an indication that the number of rejected absentee ballots could drop
