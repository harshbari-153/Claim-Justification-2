"We can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47."
it amazing but true we can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane but the fbi does have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an bloomberg wrote in an for the huffington post the same day
but unless or until the proposed law is enacted there is no dispute that the fbi currently does not have the power to block suspected terrorists from buying dynamite or an as bloomberg said unless they have some other disqualifying factor such as a felony conviction on their record
under the law the fbi would be given the latitude to deny firearms and explosives sales to people on the suspected terrorist lists
echoed the claim in a senate hearing the stark fact is that the united states department of justice has no authority to block the sale of firearms to suspected terrorists even when the department knows they are about to purchase guns
government accountability office shows bloomberg is right membership in a terrorist organization does not prohibit a person from possessing firearms or explosives under current federal law
