carson said on twitter there are more than american citizens waiting for public housing in houston tx
there are more than people waiting for public housing or public housing vouchers in houston but this waitlist doesn t exist because individuals in the country illegally are taking up spots in public housing
he is right when he says there are more than people waiting for public housing opportunities in houston but the delay is not because people who are not legal residents are taking up space in public housing
in there were more than people waiting for housing and in there were nearly on the waitlist
