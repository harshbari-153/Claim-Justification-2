HR 1 "automatically registers every welfare recipient to vote."
automatically registers every welfare recipient to vote
including that it automatically registers every welfare recipient to vote
but trump s statement creates a misleading impression that people on welfare will have a special path to voter registration regardless of eligibility
under the law public assistance applicants essentially opt in by choosing to register to vote
trump misleads about hr and voter registration for welfare recipients
