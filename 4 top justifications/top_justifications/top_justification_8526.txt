the bill also states that the attorney general and defense secretary submit a plan to congress about how to proceed with each individual detained at guantanamo bay
the house bill directs officials to write a plan about how to proceed with the detainees
but that doesn t mean that the existing detainees will be sent to facilities in the united states
