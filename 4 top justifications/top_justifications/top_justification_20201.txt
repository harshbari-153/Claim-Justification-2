dnc chair says fourth circuit court used pizza analogy to uphold health care law
wasserman schultz said the fourth circuit court in its ruling wrote if you ask for ham and pepperoni on your pizza hut pizza but then i actually go get your pizza from domino s it s implied if i bring back a pepperoni and ham pizza then that s what you asked for
the language in the fourth circuit actually compared if you buy a pizza from pizza hut to a pizza from dominoes wasserman schultz said
wasserman schultz said that if you order a pizza from pizza hut it doesn t matter where it comes from as long as you get the toppings ham and pepperoni on the pizza you ordered
what does cheap pizza have to do with health care other than if you eat too much you might need to see a doctor
