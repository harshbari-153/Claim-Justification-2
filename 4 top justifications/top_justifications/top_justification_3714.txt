Scott Maddox has run "losing campaigns for 3 of Florida's 4 available cabinet positions."
in trying to cast maddox as a politician who will run for anything he think he might win the putnam campaign said maddox has run losing campaigns for of florida available cabinet positions
as a result of his multiple losing campaigns for of florida s available cabinet positions scott maddox has confused job descriptions for the one he s running for this time
sifting out the rhetoric we wondered if maddox had already lost campaigns for three florida cabinet posts
maddox lost a campaign for attorney general and pulled out of a run for governor
we checked the state division of elections to see if maddox ran for a cabinet position or governor and lost a third time but came up empty
