although we have twice the population of greece the state of florida employs three times fewer government employees
atwater said the state of florida employs three times fewer government employees than greece
florida does directly employ about as many state government workers as greece does
but a more reasonable comparison should also include government workers at the federal and local levels which means florida s overall total of government workers would outnumber greece s employees
greece employs three times as many government workers as florida atwater says
