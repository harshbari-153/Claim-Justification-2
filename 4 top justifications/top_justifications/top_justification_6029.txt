"... in 2013 Obama determined Social Security would not send checks through the USPS, because it was not secure"
did you know in obama determined social security would not send checks through the usps because it was not secure the post reads
a facebook post said in obama determined social security would not send checks through the usps because it was not secure
although officials referenced lost and stolen checks as a potential benefit of the switch to direct deposit payments politifact found no evidence the obama administration enacted the rule because of concerns with the security of the postal service as the post claims
officials also said direct deposit payments would prevent checks from being lost or stolen but we found no evidence anyone argued the postal service was not a secure way to deliver checks
during the obama administration social security payments did largely shift to electronic delivery
