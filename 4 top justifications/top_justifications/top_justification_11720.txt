Says Adam Hasner "gives the wealthy tax breaks worth $250,000 a year but hikes middle class taxes $2,000."
lois frankel says adam hasner gives the rich a hefty tax break while hiking taxes for middle class
our ruling frankel s ad says hasner gives the wealthy tax breaks worth a year but hikes middle class taxes
here we will look at a claim from a frankel ad called real hasner gives the wealthy tax breaks worth a year but hikes middle class taxes
hasner wrote on his campaign website reducing marginal rates while broadening the tax base through the elimination of loopholes and exemptions will produce enough revenue to pay for cutting everyone s tax rates and would not require any middle class tax increase nor would it produce a net windfall for high income taxpayers
but the tax policy center report also showed that ryan s plan would mean a net tax cut for every income group over a year not a tax hike for the middle class as frankel claims
