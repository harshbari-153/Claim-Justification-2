"Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly weâ€™re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing."
lightfoot said illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing
illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing because of the availability lightfoot said on april
at the time lightfoot made her statement illinois did lag a majority of states nationally in terms of the share of its population that had been tested for according to data compiled by an independent reporting project
but illinois is not unique in the testing challenges it is facing so we wondered whether the state was really as far behind as lightfoot suggested
its database shows lightfoot was partly right and partly wrong when she said illinois was testing at a rate that put it behind all its neighbors as well as in the bottom tier nationwide
