valencia said do you know that statistically when you take the sat a second time one third of the people that take the sat even if they been studying will get a lower score than they did the first time around
changes in scores on the second sat are typically driven by a specific effect students who score low the first time are more likely to score higher the second students who have high scores the first time are statistically more likely to see a drop the second time
so we wondered whether valencia was right that a third roughly percent of students who take the sat fare worse on their second try
larry valencia says a third of students who take sat for second time do worse than first time
