"Rand Paulâ€™s speech ... on 'Gattaca' was totally ripped off of Wikipedia."
rachel maddow says rand paul speech totally ripped off of wikipedia
it s at that point maddow said he got into trouble claiming paul s comments about the movie were totally ripped off of wikipedia
maddow was dead on paul recited gattaca s wikipedia page nearly
but right now he s just lifting whole sections of this wikipedia entry hoping that nobody s going to notice and he can call it his speech
paul s speech is a more serious offense than that of obama s gaffe said jonathan bailey the creator of plagiarism today an online resource for writers to combat plagiarism
