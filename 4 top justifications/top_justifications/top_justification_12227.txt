Says President Richard Nixon held meetings with heads of state without an American interpreter.
but richard nixon was also known to hold meetings with foreign dignitaries without an american interpreter bremmer said
bremmer said apparently president nixon used to do it hold meetings with heads of state without an american interpreter because he felt did really trust the state department at that point providing the translators and did want information getting out leaking that he would want to keep private
nixon sometimes met with leaders without his own translator
