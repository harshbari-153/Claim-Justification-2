An investigation of a racist photo "confirmed what I said all along, that Iâ€™m not in the picture."
i think it confirmed what i said all along that i m not in that offensive picture northam said about an investigation into how a racist picture appeared on his page in his medical school yearbook
ralph northam says an investigation has confirmed he didn t appear in a racist photo on his personal page in his medical school yearbook
earlier today a website published a photograph of me from my medical school yearbook in a costume that is clearly racist and offensive he said on his gubernatorial website
northam wrongly says report confirms he was in racist photo
northam tweeted that photo and the racist and offensive attitudes it represents does not reflect that person i am today or the way that i have conducted myself as a soldier a doctor and a public servant
