Says Mike Bloomberg "opposed modest proposals during Barack Obamaâ€™s presidency to raise taxes on the wealthy, while advocating for cuts to Medicare and Social Security."
sanders said bloomberg opposed modest increases in taxes on the wealthy while advocating cuts in medicare and social security
did bloomberg oppose tax hikes on the wealthy while supporting cuts to medicare and social security it s not quite the way sanders presented it
bloomberg had opposed higher taxes on the wealthiest new yorkers since at least
the sanders campaign pointed to two moments in when bloomberg opposed a tax hike on wealthy new yorkers and supported cuts in medicare and social security
after we published the sanders campaign sent us additional examples of bloomberg rejecting tax hikes at the national level and advocating for cuts in entitlements
