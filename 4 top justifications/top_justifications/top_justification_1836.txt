Says Facebook is now a "public entity" that will be able to "use your photos" and "information" unless you post a statement declining your permission.
note facebook is now a public entity
anyone who uses facebook owns and controls the content and information they post as stated in our terms
there is a rumor circulating that facebook is making a change related to ownership of users information or the content they post to the site
this means for example that if you share a photo on facebook you give us permission to store copy and share it with others again consistent with your settings such as service providers that support our service or other facebook products you use
you can visit facebook s data policy page for more information
