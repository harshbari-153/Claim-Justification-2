In the Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire, none of the candidates mentioned the "middle class" or "education."
democrats say republican presidential candidates did not mention middle class or education in debate
our ruling carney was technically correct that education and the middle class were not mentioned in the debate
to illustrate that the republican presidential candidates are out of touch with ordinary americans white house press secretary jay carney cited two things that he said the candidates failed to mention during a cnn debate from new hampshire education and the middle class
so were carney and the dnc right we checked the debate transcript and found that carney is technically correct that the words middle class and education did not appear in the debate
they chose not to ask about education
