former nc gov says state has really repealed controversial bathroom bill
it might seem like house bill the controversial law that regulated transgender bathroom access has been repealed and tossed into the annals of north carolina s political history
mccrory said was really never repealed
rather than allow transgender people to use the bathroom matching their gender identity north carolina rejoined other states that have no explicit law about bathroom access for transgender people
but since the state steered clear of creating new regulations the new bill creates widespread uncertainty about whether and where transgender people can use restrooms in government buildings said chris brook legal director for the aclu of north carolina
