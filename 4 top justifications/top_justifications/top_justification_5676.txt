"The IRS is already planning on 19,500 new employees to administer" Obamaâ€™s health care mandate.
the irs is already planning on new employees to administer that mandate
that the irs estimated it must hire agents at a cost of billion to the taxpayer to enforce the federal health care overhaul got a false
but huntsman exaggerates when he says the irs plans for almost employees to administer the mandate
huntsman s claim estimates the irs employees rather than irs agents that will be tied to the health care bill
finally if we turn to huntsman s assertion during the debate that employees will be needed to administer obama s health care mandate we find it contains problems similar to previous claims we checked
