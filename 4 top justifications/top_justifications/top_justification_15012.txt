Obama's dog has his "own plane"
bo the portuguese water dog that senator ted kennedy gave to the obama family as a present apparently flies in his own private jet
arriving in a small jet before the obamas was the first dog bo a portuguese water dog given as a present by the late u
today story about the arrival of the obamas said the obamas dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the first family but there were other occupants on the plane including several other staffers
so bo did indeed arrive in a separate jet but it ridiculous to claim that he has his own airplane
is bo really commanding his own jet we decided to look into it
