Says President Barack Obama could "basically" legalize all immigrants here illegally "by the sign of a pen."
marco rubio fears obama could legalize all undocumented immigrants the sign of a pen
could obama essentially legalize million people by the sign of a pen like the dream act population
but it s a stretch to say he could legally offer all undocumented immigrants that deal
to rubio obama s policy basically legalized this group of illegal immigrants and was improper and he s not alone in this perspective
it s easy to interpret rubio s statement as obama conceivably granting citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants via an executive order
