Says he opposes statewide mask order because it would require him to "wear a mask in my house, or walking my dog."
wanggaard said he opposes statewide mask order because it would require him to wear a mask in my house or walking my dog
given the context wanggaard is suggesting the governor s mandate requires masks while walking a dog or in one s house
the july mask order generally requires all wisconsin residents to wear face coverings in public spaces indoors starting aug
but no one is going to make me wear a mask in my house or walking my dog
no order doesn t require masks in your house or walking your dog
