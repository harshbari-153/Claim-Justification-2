crozier but we re saying if this was the case and was found to have down syndrome karen handel is ok with that life being exterminated
and when palin announced her endorsement of handel on july grtl issued a press release to say they were stunned because handel views on abortion showed she did not cherish the lives of children with genetic disorders as much as she should
