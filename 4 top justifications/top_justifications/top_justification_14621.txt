evers detert and dean got a failing grade from conservatives
the clearest example of a conservative vote scorecard in florida comes from the american conservative union which gave detert dean and evers each a score of percent on nine issues that included pension reform medical malpractice reform and the parent trigger bill
in the videos americans for prosperity said that each of the three legislators got a failing grade from conservatives
jeb bush gave detert and evers percent and dean percent
when we looked into other conservative or groups that had rated florida legislators we found that only afp issued a failing grade to any of these three senators
