The proposed state budget contains "an additional tax cut for the middle class."
cuomo said he s proposing an additional tax cut for the middle class in this year s budget
i also propose in my budget a middle income tax cut
but cuomo s proposed budget legislation does contain any additional cuts
the additional tax bracket was created under former gov
so which is it are there new tax cuts in cuomo s budget or were they already passed last year
