Medicaid "is contributing to 70 percent of our budget deficit right now. Itâ€™s the one that is in our lap because of Obamacare."
medicaid is the one that is growing most rapidly and is contributing to percent of our budget deficit right now
toomey said that medicaid is contributing to percent of our budget deficit
the truth is medicaid spending annually is about percent of the size of the federal budget deficit
when we asked toomey s office for evidence that medicaid is contributing up to percent of the deficit they pointed out that spending on medicaid is equal to percent of the deficit
is medicaid driving the budget deficit as pat toomey said
