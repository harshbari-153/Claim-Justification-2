"Illegal border crossings are up 173% from 1 year ago and 28% since January when President Biden stopped the wall & deportations and started catch & release."
the facts back it up illegal border crossings are up from year ago and since january when president biden stopped the wall deportations and started catch release he said
hudson said illegal border crossings are up from year ago and since january when president biden stopped the wall deportations and started catch release
did biden stop deportations and is that part of the reason for the rise in border crossings this is a gross mischaracterization
border crossings are up but not because biden stopped the wall or deportations
however experts say the reasons for the rise in border crossings are complex and not fairly summarized by pinning the blame on border wall construction and biden s deportation policies
