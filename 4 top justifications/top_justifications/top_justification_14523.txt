"The only two (Donald Trump tax returns) we have show that he hasn't paid a penny in taxes."
clinton said the only two donald trump tax returns we have show that he has paid a penny in taxes
we decided to see whether the only two tax returns made public show that trump did pay a penny
the only two we have show that he has paid a penny in taxes
public records show that trump did not pay federal income taxes in two years and which is what clinton was referencing
the report says trump paid no federal income tax in and because according to the tax rules he lost money
