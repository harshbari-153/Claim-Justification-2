The loan guarantee program that helped Solyndra "was a program that was supported by President Bush."
plouffe said that the loan guarantee program that awarded half a billion dollars in guarantees to solyndra was supported by president bush
the program grew under the obama administration which ultimately awarded solyndra loan guarantee under a new section of the law created by the stimulus
did the program that funded the solyndra loan start under george bush david plouffe says so
org took issue with a similar statement by obama that the loan guarantee program predated him pointing out that the bush administration created while solyndra won funding under
is it fair to say the loan guarantee program was supported by president bush when it was updated under obama factcheck
