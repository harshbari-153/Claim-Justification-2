"The race will tighten, just because that's what happens at the end of campaigns. They always have."
i mean i we think that the race will tighten just because that what happens at the end of campaigns
and the fact is out of the last elections have tightened in the final few weeks of the campaign
so yes that election did tighten at the end
that is out of the past elections tightened at least somewhat in the last few weeks
so obama claim that elections tighten at the end is mostly true
