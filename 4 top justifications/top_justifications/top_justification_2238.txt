Says military commanders have said that if Donald Trump were elected, "they would not follow his orders."
biden said military commanders have said that if trump were elected they would not follow his orders
however biden s remark suggests that active military commanders have already said before the election that they would not follow certain orders issued by trump
we could find no evidence and biden s staff couldn t point to any showing active military commanders saying they would not follow certain orders from a president trump
bottom line in his scranton comments biden exaggerated by saying that current military commanders have publicly said they would not follow illegal orders from trump
when can you think of ever in history where military commanders have said before a man or woman is elected that they would not follow his orders
