Education Week says Obama 'hasn't made a significant mark on education,' is 'elusive' on accountability, and a 'staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly.'
education week says obama made a significant mark on education that he on accountability a defender of the existing public school monopoly
education week did write that obama has made a significant mark on education but the phrase is plucked out of its original context
the audio portion of the ad is misleading because education week did not say obama was elusive or a staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly
obama has made a significant mark on education policy
the charge that obama is a staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly comes from a chicago tribune opinion piece by steve chapman
