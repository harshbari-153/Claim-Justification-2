As written, the (Illinois school funding) bill includes a bailout of Chicagoâ€™s broken teacher pension system.
as written the bill includes a bailout of chicago s broken teacher pension system rauner said arguing that the measure rewarded chicago at the expense of suburban and downstate districts
the provision is designed to remedy an historical quirk in which the state subsidized the costs of teacher pensions for every school district in illinois except chicago
the chicago based center for tax and budget accountability estimates that in fiscal year about million in individual income taxes collected in chicago were used for suburban and downstate teacher pension payments
mayor rahm emanuel complained the arrangement meant chicago taxpayers were first to pay for teacher pensions in the city and then to contribute to the cost of teacher pensions everywhere else in illinois
nor has he addressed the inconsistency in arguing that the chicago pension system is undeserving of state help because it is broken when it is still in healthier financial shape than the pension system for all other teachers in illinois
