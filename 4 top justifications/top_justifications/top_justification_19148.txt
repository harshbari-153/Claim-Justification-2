Says Rand Paul thinks drug-dealing, theft, burglary and prostitution should be decriminalized.
but for the conway campaign to splice that with comments from law enforcement officials listing crime such as dealing drugs to kids promoting prostitution theft burglary and financial crime suggests paul wants to decriminalize those acts

senate takes things one step further in a campaign video using a quote from republican opponent rand paul to suggest paul wants to decriminalize everything from drug dealing and burglary to prostitution

those may be controversial positions but they are a far cry from paul saying he believes that drug dealing and burglary ought not to be against the law
