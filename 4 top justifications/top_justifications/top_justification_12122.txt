Says Joe Biden has "written a letter of apology" for calling Trumpâ€™s travel restrictions from China "xenophobic."
without evidence trump claims biden sent him apology letter over china travel ban
trump said biden called the ban on travel coming in from china xenophobic and that he actually apologized with a letter on a friday night saying he made the right move
biden has now written a letter of apology because i did the right thing trump said during a may virtual town hall with fox news
biden has used the word xenophobic several times in reference to trump but not directly in reference to the china travel policy
president donald trump repeated the misleading claim that former vice president joe biden called him xenophobic for banning travel from china in response to the coronavirus outbreak
