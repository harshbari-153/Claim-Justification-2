Says bus riders subsidize the "expensive, romanticized" Leander-to-Austin train.
basically what we re having is people riding a bus subsidizing this expensive romanticized train that really doesn t qualify or fit the needs of austin said dafoe a tax preparer in the debate televised by austin s channel
so if anybody s subsidizing the trains it s shoppers though that group likely overlaps with bus riders
updated clay dafoe says austin bus riders subsidize commuter rail
are bus riders subsidizing the trains in any sense not by the usual definition of subsidy which is a grant of money
our ruling cap metro s buses pull more of their weight so to speak than its trains
