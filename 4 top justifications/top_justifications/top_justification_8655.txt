"I have seen crime increase in every major metropolitan area (in California) â€¦ Crime is on the rise in every major market."
republican candidate for california governor travis allen recently claimed he s seen crime increase in every major metropolitan area and that crime is on the rise in every major market
was allen right has crime really increased in all california metros and is it on the rise in every major market as he claimed
she pointed us to several news articles that describe increases in crime from to both statewide and in large cities
a majority of cities saw increases in crime but not every city said brandon martin who researches crime trends for ppic who the report
that contradicts the portion of allen s statement that says crime is on the rise in every major market
