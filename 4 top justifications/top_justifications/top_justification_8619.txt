but huge numbers of people with degrees going to technical college wisconsin gov
the republican governor went on to say in fact the largest category of people coming into the technical schools in wisconsin are people with degrees because the jobs that they re looking for with their degrees aren t there and so instead they re going back to school to get more technical training
so we wondered if those groups are now being outnumbered in wisconsin s technical schools by people with bachelor s degrees
so are an increasing number of graduates heading to technical college too as of the number of degree holders transferring into one of wisconsin s technical colleges had grown percent in the last decade according to a publication from the wisconsin technical college system
