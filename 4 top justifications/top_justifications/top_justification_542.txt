"We got to almost universal coverage in health care in Colorado."
in an interview on msnbc s meet the press hickenlooper said we got to almost universal coverage in health care in colorado
hickenlooper said we got to almost universal coverage in health care in colorado
on health care he supports universal coverage and boasts about colorado s uninsured rate
though colorado is much closer to universal health care coverage than before the affordable care act hundreds of thousands of coloradans remain uninsured and other states have even lower uninsured rates
uninsured rate counts as almost universal coverage then how many other states can tout that accomplishment
