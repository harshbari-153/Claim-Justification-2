Says President Donald Trump's travel ban could ban SomalisÂ "from getting relief (from famine) through coming to the United States."
i can t see how the travel ban would affect relief efforts in and around somalia
ellison says travel ban will hurt somalis fleeing famine
so ellison is right that somalis can be banned from entering the country
they could be banned from getting relief through coming to the united states because of this ban
ellison said that people threatened by famine in somalia could be banned from getting relief through coming to the united states due to trump administration visa and refugee restrictions
