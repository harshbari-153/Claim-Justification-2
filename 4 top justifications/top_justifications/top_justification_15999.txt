"Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no federal elected office experience."
every signer of the declaration of independence had no elected office experience
it now reads every signer of the declaration of independence had no federal elected office experience emphasis added
either way carson s original claim that every signer of the declaration of independence had no elected office experience is way way off
many of the signers of the declaration of independence had held elective office before joining the continental congress which produced the declaration
as for his later addition of federal to the comment this makes the claim nonsensical since there was no federal government prior to the signing of the declaration
