"We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before."
we now sell more products made in america to the rest of the world than ever before obama said
president obama said the united states is selling more products made here to other countries than ever before
it s worth noting that the president specifically referred to products made in america in contrast to a broader view on trade that blends both goods and services
when president obama cheered the record level of sales for american products that didn t address the country s trade deficit
generally speaking strong economies sell more to others than they buy in return
