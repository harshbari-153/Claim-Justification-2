Says Ronald Reagan "got the Saudis to flood the market with cheap oil."
michael reagan said his father got saudi arabia to flood the market with oil in order to drive down prices and undermine the soviet economy
since selling oil was the source of the kremlin wealth my father got the saudis to flood the market with cheap oil
ronald reagan son says his father got the saudis to pump more oil to undercut ussr
we have no public documents to confirm that reagan asked the saudis to use oil as an economic weapon against the ussr
another bit of information from saudi arabia also undercuts the reagan claim
