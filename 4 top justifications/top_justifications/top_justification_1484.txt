Says an alternative to Social Security that operates in Galveston County, Texas, has meant that participants will "retire with a whole lot more money" than under Social Security.
instead we ll cut to the bottom line has the program meant that participants retire with a whole lot more money than they would under social security first some background on the galveston program which is an oddity in american policy
the takeaway from the gao and ssa studies is that the galveston plan can be better than social security if you re better off and if you fall into certain specific demographic categories
on the specific question cain raised whether participants in galveston will retire with a whole lot more money than if they were in social security the answer is it depends
but if you are on the low end of the income scale social security will give you a relatively better payout at retirement compared with the alternate plan
but workers with lower earnings and more dependents tend to receive more money under social security
