bowman said more white legacy students get admitted to top universities than black latinx students admitted through affirmative action
more white legacy students get admitted to top universities than black latinx students admitted through affirmative action bowman tweeted on jan
in reality the paper s analysis estimated that collectively the number of blacks and latino admitted as a result of affirmative action was higher than the number of white legacy admissions
however he added that many top universities do enroll more legacy students than they do black or latino students
it also hard to say what share of white legacy admits and black and latino admits received preferences from their legacy status or from affirmative action respectively
