Video shows the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was a "completely peaceful protest."
new video shows completely peaceful protest inside us capitol on jan
no the riot at the capitol on wasn t a completely peaceful protest
just because this wasn t shown in the footage shared by the gateway pundit does not mean that the events of that amounted to a completely peaceful protest
when rioters breached the capitol by forcing past barricades and law enforcement
the footage shows people milling around the capitol some carrying trump flags
