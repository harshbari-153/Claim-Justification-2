so when the test is to the kids the second and third time those harder questions are taken out
seniors who retake the necap should find that the second test is just as difficult as the first because it the same test that juniors are taking
mancuso said it was important to note that the second and third necap test that given is not the same necap test that they given originally
krieger said although questions on the necap change from year to year as they do for most standardized tests the test is not if students need to retake it in the beginning of their senior year
