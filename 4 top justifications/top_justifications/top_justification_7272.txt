After hearing "the frustrations parents and teachers have with the FCAT," next year "we begin improving our testing system."
next year we begin improving our testing system
so is scott taking action to improve testing and end teaching to the test actually we found new education standards and assessments were in the works before he took office
i listened to the frustrations parents and teachers have with the fcat scott said
she pointed to other examples of the state s progression toward the new testing system under scott including the department training education professionals over the summer and the state college system being the first in the country to work common core into its curriculum
a fear of teachers teaching to the test has not dissipated for some school advocates
