New carbon regulations will increase electric bills by "$17 billion every year" and "potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."
boehner said the epa s plan to regulate carbon emissions in existing power plants will increase electric bills by billion every year and potentially put an average of more people out of work every year
a large chunk of the chamber s estimated costs of the carbon rules comes from the assumption that new natural gas plants will require carbon capture technology which they say is percent more expensive to build and also more expensive to operate
on his website house speaker john boehner put it in more direct terms the president s plan would indeed cause a surge in electricity bills costs stand to go up billion every year
for its part the epa says that the new rules will save consumers money on their electric bills and will spur economic growth that will surpass the expense
but it would also shut down plants and potentially put an average of more people out of work every year
