"As chairman of the City Colleges, I cut millions in waste and we cut property taxes."
as chairman of the city colleges i cut millions in waste and we cut property taxes
chico said as chairman of the city colleges i cut millions in waste and we cut property taxes
waste is a subjective term so we reached out to chico s campaign to ask what he meant by saying he cut millions of it
did chico cut waste and slash taxes during his city colleges stint
cutting millions in spending and slashing property taxes sounded like a tall order especially given that chico s tenure at city colleges began in and lasted less than seven months
