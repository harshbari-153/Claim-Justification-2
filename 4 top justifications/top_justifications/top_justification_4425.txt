"I never considered myself a maverick."
so it came as a surprise to us when mccain was quoted on newsweek magazine website on april saying i never considered myself a maverick
so we rate his statement that i never considered myself a maverick to be pants on firei a maverick
he the original maverick
finally worth the fighting for the education of an american maverick and the heroes who inspired him book by john mccain and mark salter published mccain slight defense we should say that he has on a number of occasions expressed a degree of ambivalence about the title maverick including his use of the word in his republican national convention acceptance speech
