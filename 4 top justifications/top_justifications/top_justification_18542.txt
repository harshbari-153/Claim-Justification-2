"The Republican candidate [John Loughlin] has talked about privatizing Social Security ... so we know where he stands on the issue."
cicilline says loughlin has talked about privatizing social security
speaking quite literally it true that loughlin has talked about the concept of privatization
though loughlin does support the concept of allowing people to make choices about parts of their contribution money that is not the same by any stretch of the imagination as privatizing social security he argues
taking it point by point cicilline is correct when he says loughlin has talked about privatization
moving on to the next part of his claim we asked cicilline for examples of where loughlin stands on the issue of privatization
