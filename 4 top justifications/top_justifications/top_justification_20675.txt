"Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget."
we rate kasich s claim that ted strickland destroyed ohio jobs when he busted the budget as false
he says ted strickland destroyed ohio jobs when he busted the budget and raised our taxes to help pay for his mistakes
how did the governor destroy ohio jobs what does busted the budget mean and what were strickland mistakes we asked the kasich campaign
finally the claim that strickland destroyed ohio jobs amounts to political hyperbole
that still didn t tell us what busted the budget means or how strickland busted it
