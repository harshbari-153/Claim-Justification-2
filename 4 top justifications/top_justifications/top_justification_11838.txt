"I'm calling into question the accuracy of the ruling. The district judge in Seattle said there was no indication of terrorism from these seven countries in our country."
for instance the district judge in seattle said that there was no indication of terrorism from these seven countries and our country
the district judge in seattle said there was no indication of terrorism from these seven countries in our country
the district judge in seattle said there was no indication of terrorism from these seven countries in our country
did court find no indication of terrorism from seven nations in trump order
these passages did affirmatively state that there was no indication of terrorism as miller said but rather that the government did present any such evidence
