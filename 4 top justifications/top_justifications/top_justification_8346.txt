"We get 30 percent of our oil from the Gulf (of Mexico)."
what caught our eye was hatch comment that we get percent of our oil from the gulf
now you could use that statistic to justify hatch statement that we get percent of our oil from the gulf
in other words percent of the crude oil produced in the united states in came from the gulf
hatch says percent of our oil comes from the gulf
instead we think that an equally fair if not more fair reading of his statement is that percent of the oil used in the united states comes from the gulf
