"Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating at least 100 patients under the age of two."
blue cross blue shield pays your doctor a bonus for fully vaccinating at least patients under the age of two an instagram post claimed
no blue cross blue shield physicians are paid a bonus to meet a vaccine quota
misleading claims that blue cross blue shield is paying doctors to meet child vaccination quotas have been spreading across social media
under blue cross blue shield rules pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least of patients are fully vaccinated and that includes the flu vaccine
blue cross blue shield chief medical officer vincent nelson told lead stories physicians and providers can be incentivized through their work with independent blue cross and blue shield companies but the implication in this post that physicians and providers pursue childhood vaccinations solely for financial reasons is false
