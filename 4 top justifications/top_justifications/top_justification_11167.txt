"15 years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now itâ€™s $10,000 a month."
fifteen years ago cancer drugs cost an average of a year
the report reads the average cancer drug price for approximately one year of therapy or a total treatment duration was less than before
maher said years ago cancer drugs cost an average of a year
because many cancer drugs are not administered to patients for a full year it s difficult to determine an average annual cost so the first half of maher s statement that they cost about a year years ago is hard to nail down
the average annual cost of a drug isn t easy to calculate given the way cancer drugs are scheduled many drugs aren t used every month for an entire year
