"The owner of Taco Bell said them animals need to be shot (black ppl)!"
the owner of taco bell said them animals need to be shot black ppl so stp spending money there
taco bell seemed to confirm that some threatening statement of this type had been made but by a former employee of one of its franchised restaurants not an owner
we confirmed with the franchisee that this individual no longer works for them and hasn t in some time taco bell said in a statement to politifact
com that said facebook posters had identified the same man as the owner of a taco bell in louisiana and as the one who made the statement
but a post by the user gave a man s name and referred to him as the taco bell owner
