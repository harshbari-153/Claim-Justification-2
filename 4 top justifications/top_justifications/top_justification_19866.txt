"On the personal tax side, middle-income people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts or, in certain cases, increases" under the Republican tax bills.
mnuchin said on the personal tax side people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts or in certain cases increases under the republican tax bills
instead mnuchin said if you look at this simply and people just look at are their personal taxes going up or down on the personal tax side middle income people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts or in certain cases increases
and the same thing with the corporate tax cuts
it s worth emphasizing that these other analyses show that many americans would indeed see a tax cut under the gop bills
so the very same report shows that the bill as a whole not just the personal tax changes is tilted a lot more heavily towards wealthier americans than mnuchin indicated
