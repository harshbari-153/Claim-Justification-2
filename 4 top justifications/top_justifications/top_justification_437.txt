Says he "opposed $716 billion cut to Medicare."
bill young says he opposed billion medicare cut
our ruling young s ad says he voted against the controversial billion medicare cut
does that mean he rejected the billion cut to medicare we also checked a dueling medicare claim from his challenger democratic lawyer jessica ehrlich over whether he voted for the ryan budgets that end the current medicare system
what he voted against was the affordable care act which implements an estimated billion reduction in payments to hospitals and private insurers in effort to reduce the program s costs
it s worth pointing out young could not have known he was specifically voting against billion in medicare cuts as that had not been tabulated in time for the health care vote that happened two years earlier
