"PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES that manufacture vaccines have IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION!"
one part of his website that caught our eye is a statement that pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines have immunity from prosecution
west said pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines have immunity from prosecution
while west is correct that manufacturers of vaccines have certain legal immunities his use of the term prosecution implies criminal activity and civil protections carry caveats
vaccine manufacturers have to properly manufacture the vaccines and could be found liable if they knowingly released a tainted vaccine
this program shields the vaccine manufacturing companies from liability while paying for vaccine related injuries or deaths
