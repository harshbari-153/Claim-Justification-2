"I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in."
president i still live in the same neighborhood i grew up in
rubio said he still lives in the same neighborhood he grew up in
it s all a neighborhood he said
but it pretty brazen to put your residence there in a nationally televised speech when you are actively trying to leave that neighborhood and you stand to make more than a bucks by doing so
and two at a listing price of the home on a cul de sac is not what some may consider working class
