"Janice Hahn hired hard-core gang members with taxpayer money to be 'gang-intervention specialists.' She even helped them get out of jail, so they could rape and kill again."
still it a stretch to say janice hahn hired gang members with taxpayer money to be specialists
the issue though is whether hahn hired these specialists with taxpayer money and even helped get some of them out of jail
video accuses janice hahn of hiring gang members with taxpayer money as specialists
so what about the charge that hahn even helped them get out of jail so they could rape and kill again
it comes via a voiceover at the start of the video in an insane effort to reduce gang violence janice hahn hired hardcore gang members with taxpayer money to be specialists
