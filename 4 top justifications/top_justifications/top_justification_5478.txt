The ACLU didn't call for an investigation (of the Newark police department), they called for an immediate federal monitor.
to review the mayor tried to downplay the controversy by saying the aclu called for a federal monitor of the newark police department instead of requesting an investigation
newark mayor cory booker says aclu sought monitor for police rather than investigation
booker now says that what he was really resistant to in september was that the aclu didn t call for an investigation they called for an immediate federal monitor according to his may interview with jami floyd on the brian lehrer radio show at
booker responded well actually what we were specifically resistant to is the aclu didn t call for an investigation they called for an immediate federal monitor which was almost to the point of being ridiculous so we immediately reached out to the doj and asked them to help us to get this cloud off of our police department but more importantly when i started talking to tom perez s team we realized very quickly that the doj had worked with many police departments around the country helping them to improve their practices
use of a federal monitor is mentioned as an option in addition to an investigation in the final pages of the petition for all of the foregoing reasons the petitioners respectfully ask the united states department of justice special litigation section to forthwith commence an investigation into the newark new jersey police department
