Under a proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, people on Medicare will only have $15,000 from the federal government to spend on their health care.
people who turn in or later would not enroll in the current medicare program but instead would be entitled to a premium support payment to help them purchase private health insurance
this ryan plan for medicare is to get rid of medicare as we have known it give seniors a voucher to buy medicare which probably does not cover the health costs for a lot of seniors
the average medicare beneficiary in wouldn t have to spend on all expenses
that plan might have limits and and deductibles as current medicare does but the money the plan could spend on any given beneficiary s health expenses would not be capped at per year
and according to cbo the typical would be responsible for a bigger share of costs including premiums deductibles and under ryan s plan than under traditional medicare due to such factors as higher administrative costs including profits for private plans and a slower increase in the government s contribution over time than the rate at which medical costs increase
