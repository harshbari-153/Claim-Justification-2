The Wisconsin school voucher program "has no research that shows that itâ€™s going to improve student learning."
burke said the wisconsin voucher program has no research that shows that it s going to improve student learning
what i want to see is initiatives and programs that are actually based on research and success that s going to improve education instead of saying that well our answer is just to roll out a voucher program that actually has no research that shows that it s going to improve student learning
wolf said that while there is no overall evidence that voucher schools improved learning in milwaukee for burke to say there is no evidence is a bit of a stretch given what the arkansas research found
wisconsin does not require voucher schools to publicly disclose measures such as retention rates graduation rates or exam scores
burke goes too far in saying there is no evidence that vouchers improve student learning but the evidence is thin
