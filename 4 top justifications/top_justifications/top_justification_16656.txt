"Our economy (in Louisiana) has grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession."
we wondered whether it s correct that louisiana has grown percent faster than the national gdp even since the national recession
jindal said our economy in louisiana has grown percent faster than the national gdp even since the national recession
our economy has grown percent faster than the national gdp even since the national recession
if you look at it this way the united states economy has grown faster or shrunk less in three of these years compared to two years when the louisiana economy did better which undercuts jindal s claim
so when the economy is in a recession we tend to do better than average
