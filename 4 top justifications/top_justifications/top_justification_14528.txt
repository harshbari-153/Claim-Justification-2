"Matt Patten kicked off his dirty campaign with thousands in dirty cash from guess who? (Frank) Russo and (Jimmy) Dimora."
in patten s case the link to dimora as well as former cuyahoga county auditor frank russo was the thousands in dirty cash from the pair that the democrat received during a january event according to the ad
house republicans also note that russo and dimora were two of the main sponsors of the event in january in arguing that patten was close to the pair
the ad states very explicitly russo and dimora were the ones giving the thousands to patten
additionally the dimora boosters club gave patten and the friends of frank russo gave him in july
for his part patten acknowledges that dimora and russo were sponsors of the fundraiser but says that neither man actually attended the event
