Says President Obama said of the national debt, "If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition."
did obama say of the national debt if i do have this done in three years then there going to be a proposition
obama wasn t talking about the deficit or the debt when he said if i do have this done in three years then there going to be a proposition
if i do have this done in three years then there going to be a proposition
did obama say he would be held accountable for not halving the deficit in three years when we went to the tape we found americans for prosperity was pulling together two different interviews and on two different topics
obama is then heard saying i will be held accountable before appearing in a video and continuing if i do have this done in three years then there going to be a proposition
