"Jane Norton supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history."
americans for job security said that jane norton supported the largest tax hike in colorado history
colorado families and workers need relief yet jane norton supported the largest tax hike in colorado history costing us billions
what americans for job security calls the largest tax hike in colorado history is actually subject to debate some people contend it was a tax increase at all
still it was fairly easy for us to reach the president of americans for job security stephen demaura and ask him about the group claims specifically that norton supported the largest tax hike in colorado history costing us billions
but there are a number of qualifiers to that yes the evidence is not conclusive that it the largest tax increase in colorado history though certainly it the largest in recent years
