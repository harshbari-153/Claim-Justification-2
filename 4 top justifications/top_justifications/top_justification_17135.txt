"(Barack Obama) says he’s going to reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn’t say how he's going to do it."
he says he s going to reduce the debt and deficit by trillion doesn t say how he s going to do it christie a republican told gregory
our ruling in an interview on nbc s meet the press christie claimed obama says he s gon na reduce the debt and deficit by trillion doesn t say how he gon na do it
the governor repeated that claim later in the interview saying obama puts out a nice ad that says he s going to reduce the debt by four trillion but never tells us how
but the president has outlined in extensive detail how he would achieve more than trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade
ok governor let s be fair you re wrong to claim obama has not outlined his deficit reduction plan
