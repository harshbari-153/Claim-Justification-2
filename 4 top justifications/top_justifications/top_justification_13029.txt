The Atlanta shooting suspect wrote an anti-China post on Facebook prior to the shootings.
post supposedly written by atlanta shooting suspect is fake
but as details about the shooting continue to unfold it appears that some on social media are reaching conclusions based on what looks like a facebook post made by long
facebook also told politifact that the screenshot does not show a real post
the post was flagged as part of facebook s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed
while the origins of the screenshot aren t known we do know that the post was manufactured using an online tool and didn t come from an authentic facebook account
