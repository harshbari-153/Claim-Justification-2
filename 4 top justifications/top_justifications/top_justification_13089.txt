"If Bezos has 200 billion dollas, and there’s 7 billion people on earth, why can’t we each get a billion and (he’d) be left with 193 billion dollas?"
if bezos has billion dollas and there s billion people on earth why can t we each get a billion and he d be left with billion dollas left the oct
in order to provide billion to each person on earth bezos would have to have more money than even he has
looked at a different way if you rounded up bezos fortune to the even billion stated in the post and apportioned it evenly among the world s
billion people
a claim about distributing jeff bezos billions gets the math wrong
