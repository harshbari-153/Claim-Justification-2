Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was right that President Barack Obamaâ€™s health care bill created what "would, in effect, be death panels."
health care bill opponents could make a case that palin is justified in fearing that the current reform could one day transform into such a board but that s not what she said
during the republican primary debate in new hampshire gingrich reused an old gem of a claim that president barack obama s health care reform created death panels
i think candidly governor palin got attacked unfairly for describing what would in effect be death panels he said
she said seniors and the disabled will have to stand in front of obama panel so his bureaucrats can decide based on a subjective judgment of their of productivity in society whether they are worthy of health care
politifact national traced the controversy to a post on palin s facebook page aug
