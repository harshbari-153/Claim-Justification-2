Olive Garden employees are allowed to wear Black Lives Matter masks "but NOT the American flag."
i find it odd that olive garden employees are allowed to wear blm mask but not the american flag
olive garden hasn t banned american flag masks
team members may wear either if they choose to do so
we ve previously debunked claims about businesses banning the american flag and a new one about olive garden home of unlimited soup salad and breadsticks is also wrong
that is not true olive garden replied on sept
