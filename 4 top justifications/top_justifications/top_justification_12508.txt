"When President Obama was running for re-election â€¦ Senator Sanders was trying to find someone to primary him."
sanders was trying to find someone to primary him
sanders was trying to find someone to primary him o malley said on nov
that doesn t mean sanders was actively searching for a candidate to actually run against obama
so it s clear that sanders was suggesting a primary challenge to move obama to the left experts said but not exactly the way o malley phrased it
as a sitting senator sanders comments at a minimum were provocative he think it was a bad idea for a candidate to run against obama in the primary
