"The fact is voter fraud is rampant."
but generally the prevalence of voter fraud has widely been doubted
by phone clark told us that under no definition of rampant is voter fraud rampant in texas and the united states though she said that doesn t mean it doesn t happen
that s not a lot of fire but it was sufficient for us to find false a democrat s claim that studies had shown voter fraud to be in texas
abbott the former longtime state attorney general went on the fact is voter fraud is rampant and in texas unlike some other states and unlike some other leaders we are committed to cracking down on voter fraud
could there have been a fresh surge in fraud
