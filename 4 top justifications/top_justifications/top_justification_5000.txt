can you drive the length of a football field in the time it takes to check a text
when you take your eyes off the road for up to just to look at a text for five seconds you may have covered the distance of a football field walden said while shooting a commercial for the campaign
multiply that by and the person would drive feet over seconds or more than the feet or feet length of a football field
walden didn t specify speed in his statement but he hedged it to say that the driver may have covered the length of a football field while texting
at mph that like driving the length of an entire football field blindfolded
