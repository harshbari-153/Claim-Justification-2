Edwards says if Congress won't pass universal health care, he'll tell Congress: "I'm going to use my power as president to take your health care away from you."
but if you do pass universal health care by july of in six months i going to use my power as president to take your health care away from you
when i president i going to say to members of congress and members of my administration including my cabinet i glad that you have health care coverage and your family has health care coverage edwards says
the problem with this statement is that the president ca just take away health care from congress
during that speech he explained that his plan was to submit legislation that ends health care coverage for the president all members of congress and all senior political appointees in both branches of government on july unless we have passed universal health care reform
health care for congress and the administration is passed by statute
