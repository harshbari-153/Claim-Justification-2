Darryl Hicks had seven ethics violations and didn't pay most of the fines.
hicks paid in fines last week to clear up other late disclosure reports
i like for you to tell the people of georgia about your seven ethics violations and your seven ethics fines most of which you have not paid dating all the way back to butler said referring to hicks failed bid for secretary of state
state records show some fines were paid in when hicks said he received invoices from the state that he had not paid the late fees
you either had ethics fines or not
butler is technically correct that hicks violated the ethics act
