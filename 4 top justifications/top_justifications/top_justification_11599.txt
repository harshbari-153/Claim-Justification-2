a facebook post shared by a dallas area school said that the state is allowing online learning with attendance stipulations but will not fund school districts if they do not open their schools and if schools do not open and are not funded there will be no more teachers or school at all
the texas education agency is allowing online learning with attendance stipulations but will not fund school districts if they do not open their schools reads the post from wilmer hutchins elementary school
if schools do not open and are not funded there will be no more teachers or school at all
tea officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment about how much state funding would be affected if a school does not follow these guidelines
there has been nothing in tea guidelines or other communications that has suggested that schools that lose funding will stop operating
