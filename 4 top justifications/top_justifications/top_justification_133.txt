Democrats in the 1930s wanted President Franklin Roosevelt "to be more conservative."
george will says democrats in wanted fdr be more conservative
before the election and after the election in which roosevelt carried of states democrats said they wanted him to be more conservative and only about percent of democrats said they wanted to increase spending
and asked should president roosevelt second administration be more liberal more conservative or about the same as his first exactly percent of democratic respondents said more conservative while percent said more liberal and percent said about the same
we were even aware that scientific public opinion polling existed in the so we decided will claim that democrats wanted roosevelt to become more conservative was worth closer look
so democrats were once again likelier to say that fdr was too liberal than that he was too conservative but both groups of respondents were far outnumbered by those who said fdr approach was about right
