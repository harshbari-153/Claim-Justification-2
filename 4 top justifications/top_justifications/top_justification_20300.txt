Says McCain "supported George Bush's policies 95 percent of the time."
he is right that mccain voted with the bush administration percent of the time in according to an analysis by congressional quarterly
mccain percent score was the mark of his presidential support during president bush tenure and was partly a reflection of the new political calculus in the congress
he supported bush as infrequently as percent of the time in and backed the president position an average of percent of the time since
but he did and gave a misleading picture of mccain support for bush
you ca change america when you supported george bush policies percent of the time biden said of mccain
