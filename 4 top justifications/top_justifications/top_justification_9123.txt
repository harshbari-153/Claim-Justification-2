Says the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction proposal went from President Barack Obama's desk to "the garbage can."
jon huntsman says president barack obama threw deficit reduction plan the garbage can
they found that the president did not fully embrace the commission s recommendations at the outset but that obama later outlined deficit reduction measures similar to those proposed by the commission
and the bipartisan proposal lands right on the desk of barack obama and it lands in the garbage can
our ruling huntsman used a metaphor to describe what happened to the deficit reduction proposal
we wondered did obama discard the policy proposals suggested by the the deficit commission we checked similar claims before and think there better evidence they landed in a desk file than a round file
