Says he didn't support the lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
mike supports a lawsuit that would end the affordable care act that would end conditions
he stressed that he was opposed to any replacement of obamacare that does not cover conditions
in his response braun criticized the affordable care act saying that it was doomed to fail because you had big government get in cahoots with big health care specifically big health insurance
this led a group of states to challenge obamacare in court again arguing that as the individual mandate could not be enforced the entire law had become unconstitutional
did donnelly falsely assume that braun as a republican would support the lawsuit to end obamacare
