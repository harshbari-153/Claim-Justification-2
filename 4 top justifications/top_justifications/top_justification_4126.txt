this decision is an unfortunate example of why those of us in montpelier need to work together to make vermont a more affordable place to do business and make sure our policies help businesses thrive rather than creating unique burdens and barriers to growth that make us less competitive with other states scott wrote in a statement last week

we wondered are vermont s policymakers to blame for energizer s pending departure
but rebecca kelley a spokesperson for scott said that it was that energizer is moving out of state because vermont s business environment isn t competitive
