"The top 1 percent pay over half of the entire revenue for this country."
we wo take sides in the argument over the best tax policy but we do think it worth checking his statistic that the top percent pay over half of the entire revenue for this country
he makes it sound as if the top percent of the country is shouldering more than half of the burden of funding the federal government when in fact it about half that
we also acknowledge that the top percent of taxpayers does pay a disproportionate share of taxes generally
that is the top percent of american earners paid for percent of all federal taxes that year according to the tax policy center
a big reason for the difference is that the top percent pay percent or less of payroll and excise taxes
