Says that President Obama said, "Nobody made these guys go to war. ... Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice?"
did you get this it says president barack obama said the troops whine about bearing the costs of their choice and that nobody made these guys go to war
did barack obama say the troops and made these guys go to war pants on fire
nobody made these guys go to war
in fact the chain is pretty much the opposite of obama actual comments about the troops
look it an all volunteer force obama complained
