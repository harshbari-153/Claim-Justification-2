"If the Republicans were the majority, (Rep. Barton) would have actually the gavel and the chairmanship."
if republicans were in the majority right now then barton would be chair
the fact is even if republicans were to win a majority in the house it appears unlikely barton would have assumed chairmanship of the energy and commerce committee next year anyway
a literal reading of emanuel comments leaves ambiguous whether he is saying if the republicans were the majority right now then barton would be chair or if he predicting what could happen if republicans were to regain control of the house in the midterm elections
given the republican leadership s rebuke of barton s comment and the fact that democrats have clearly seized on it as a potential wedge issue in the upcoming elections emanuel called it a political gift it s hard to imagine barton would be likely to win such an exception
white house chief of staff rahm emanuel alluded to that on abc this week on june when he warned the ranking republican barton would have oversight into the energy industry and if the republicans were the majority would have actually the gavel and the chairmanship
