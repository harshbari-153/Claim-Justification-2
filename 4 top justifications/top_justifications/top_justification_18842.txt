The fiscal cliff deal "increased spending."
as we said above the fiscal cliff deal is a spending increase if you use this baseline
they compared spending under the fiscal cliff deal with the former law
thanks to the fiscal cliff deal passed by congress on new year s day a series of automatic spending cuts and tax hikes designed to pressure legislators into acting on the federal budget won t go into effect until march
compared with what would have happened without a deal it s a spending increase
the heritage foundation found that the deal increased spending by billion over years
