"Tim Pawlenty has cut education funding in Minnesota. Classrooms are overcrowded. Districts have gone to four-day school weeks."
behind sunny images of children in classrooms and on school buses smiling or talking with dayton a voice intones tim pawlenty has cut education funding in minnesota
but dayton s claim that pawlenty cut education funding is misleading
mark dayton says gov tim pawlenty cut education spending
but his allegation that pawlenty cut education funding is complicated by the fact that actual dollars went up while pawlenty was in office
in dollars education funding increased though perhaps not quickly enough to keep up with the cost of education in minnesota
