"The Congressional Budget Office most recently came out and analyzed the current (health care) plan and said that it was not only deficit-neutral, but also that over 10 years it would create a $6 billion surplus."
the congressional budget office most recently came out and analyzed the current plan and said that it was not only which has been one of the important factors for the president and congressional leaders but also that over years it would create a billion surplus carnahan told an audience on july at forest park community college in st
still the bill would create a billion deficit according to cbo
it a claim that been repeated by many democrats since the congressional budget office a nonpartisan group that does all the number crunching for congress released its cost estimate for the health care bill on july
we were perplexed how could carnahan proclaim a billion surplus if the budget office was projecting a deficit the confusion comes down to an accounting question about how to treat billion in the house bill that would cover the cost of adjusting medicare reimbursement rates so doctors do face the potential of a percent cut in fees
the budget office did not say there would be a billion surplus it said there would be a billion deficit
