Five JetBlue pilots died from the COVID-19 vaccine.
a post that s being shared on facebook suggests that five jetblue pilots died in connection to the vaccine but there s no evidence to support that
deaths of jetblue pilots falsely connected to vaccine
jetblue told politifact that it was aware of a report that mentions four of our pilots and one inflight crew member who have passed away this year but said there is no connection in their deaths or to the vaccine
the post shares a video of a talk show in which a guest says that a jetblue pilot came forward to say that five jetblue pilots passed away between february of this year and may
we previously a similar claim that the death of four british airways pilots was connected to the vaccine
