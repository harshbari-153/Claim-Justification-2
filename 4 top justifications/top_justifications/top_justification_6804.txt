Say "Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country."
an article on facebook claimed pope says that the rights of muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country
did pope francis say that the rights of muslim migrants are more important than any country s safety concerns about them
the pope discussed ensuring all migrants personal safety over national security
it turns out that a large part of the article is copied from a reuters article titled pope says migrants rights should override national security concerns
rather it mentions that the pope called for broader options for migrants and refugees to enter destination countries safely and legally
