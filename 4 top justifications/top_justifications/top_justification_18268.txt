a tweet said countless southwest airlines employees have walked out of their jobs to oppose the vaccine mandate causing operations to effectively shut down
in separate statements to the press southwest airlines and the union representing its pilots denied the widespread internet rumors that claimed the airline canceled thousands of flights because crew members walked off the job or called in sick to protest the company s vaccine mandate
but the cancellations occurred shortly after the southwest airlines pilots association petitioned a court to temporarily block the company s vaccine mandate prompting speculation among some social media users that the flights were dropped not because of bad weather or other issues but because southwest pilots staged a walkout or sickout in a protest against the mandate
southwest is canceling flights and blaming the weather because their employees are saying no to the authoritarian vaccine mandate said another post on instagram
