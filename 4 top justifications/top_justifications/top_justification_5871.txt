"For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days."
for the first time in the modern political era we have confirmed a new justice in the first days
trump said for the first time in the modern political era we have confirmed a new justice in the first days
he is indeed the first modern president to fill an open supreme court seat within the first days
however trump s statement leaves out the important fact that it s rare for a president to have the opportunity to nominate a justice in those first days
the reality is that very few presidents are presented with the opportunity to appoint and confirm a new supreme court justice within their first days
