"McDonaldâ€™s and Coke have both announced no whites will be hired in top positions."
mcdonald s and coke have both announced no whites will be hired in top positions one facebook post says
no mcdonald s and didn t say they aren t hiring white people
there is no mention in the article or in the company s statement of not hiring white people to leadership roles nor is there anything to suggest that would happen
a bold allegation being shared on social media claims that two big companies mcdonald s and have sworn off white executives
but there s no evidence of the claim in this facebook post not in mcdonald s or s press releases not in their twitter accounts and not in any news coverage
