"Beto O’Rourke wants to confiscate guns because he can’t buy one himself due to his criminal record."
in the post in question the first phrase is beto o rourke wants to confiscate the guns because he s a liberal
a facebook post circulating after the democratic debate said that o rourke can t buy a gun due to his criminal record
the second which drake seems to signal his approval of reads beto o rourke wants to confiscate guns because he can t buy one himself due to his criminal record
o rourke could purchase a gun
we ve looked at o rourke s arrest record in the past but is he ineligible to purchase a gun as the post suggests
