"Since I took office, Michigan has added more than 25,000 auto jobs."
since i took office michigan has added more than auto jobs whitmer wrote in a june tweet
whitmer claimed that since she entered office michigan has added more than auto jobs
using that measure whitmer s claim that michigan has added more than new auto jobs isn t borne out by employment data from the bureau of labor statistics
the number of auto jobs in michigan as of may the most recently available data was slightly lower than it was in january when whitmer took office
publicly available employment data does not show that michigan has gained additional jobs in the auto industry since january when whitmer entered office
