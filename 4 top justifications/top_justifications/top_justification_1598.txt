Says that before Rick Perry became governor, "only 4 percent of our total labor force was a minimum wage job ... Today, that number has more than doubled (to) 9.5 percent."
before he took office only percent of our total labor force was a minimum wage job percent
he said that if he d said the percentage of hourly workers earning the minimum wage or less in texas has doubled since perry first full year as governor his point would have been the same the audience would have understood the same idea and the statement would be snagged on any technicalities

asked why the governor is responsible for changes in the state s share of hourly workers villarreal replied that perry has taken credit for job creation in the state so all jobs should be taken into account
percent of texas hourly workers were paid at or below the minimum wage
