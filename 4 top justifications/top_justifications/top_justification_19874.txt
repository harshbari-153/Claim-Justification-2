one of the interesting things about the recovery act was most of the projects came in under budget faster than expected because there just not a lot of work there obama said in an interview on minutes on nov
we break this into two parts whether most stimulus projects came in under budget and whether they were faster than expected
but he stretched the facts at least what is actually known when he claimed most projects have come in under budget and faster than expected
as a result many projects in and prime time for the stimulus came in well under budget
while outlays may be a good measure of the progress of stimulus spending we also think most people would interpret obama comment to mean that projects were actually being done faster than expected
