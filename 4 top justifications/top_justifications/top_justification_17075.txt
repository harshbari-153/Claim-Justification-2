Says U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan attacked the president for "the same amount of Medicare savings that (Ryan) had in his own budget."
our ruling clinton said that ryan attacked the president for the same amount of medicare savings that ryan had in his own budget
and the democratic response to that well ryan s plan cuts that amount too for this check we re looking at clinton s claim that ryan attacked the president for the same amount of medicare savings that ryan had in his own budget
clinton says ryan attacked obama for medicare cuts reflected in ryan own budget
when congressman paul ryan looked into that tv camera and attacked president obama medicare savings as quote the biggest coldest power play i did know whether to laugh or cry clinton said in his sept
so ryan confirmed his budget includes the medicare savings
