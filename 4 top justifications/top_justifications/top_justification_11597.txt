in fact if we choose obamacare expansion will lose eligibility for their subsidies of which would be forced into medicaid
crisafulli said if we choose obamacare expansion will lose eligibility for their subsidies of which would be forced into medicaid

many of the very poor would likely see becoming eligible for medicaid as a benefit
his office confirmed he meant they will be left without subsidies and will not make enough money to buy policies so medicaid will be their only option
