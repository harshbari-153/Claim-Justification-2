Says Condoleezza Rice said, "If you are taught bitterness and anger, then you will believe you are a victim. You will feel aggrieved and the twin brother of aggrievement is entitlement. So now you think you are owed something and you don’t have to work for it and now you’re on a really bad road to nowhere because there are people who will play to that sense of victimhood, aggrievement and entitlement, and you still won’t have a job."

condoieezza rice sums up the democratic party in words the post says misspelling her name before launching into the quote if you are taught bitterness and anger then you will believe you are a victim
you will feel aggrieved and the twin brother of aggrievement is entitlement
condoleezza rice once spoke about entitlement but this isn t a direct quote
the moment we begin to believe that we are doing badly because someone else is doing well that moment that aggrievement takes over it s not long before his twin brother comes behind and that would be entitlement
