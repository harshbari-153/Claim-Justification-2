in an april press release wu warned that seniors in his district would face in higher annual health care costs if a republican budget proposal is passed
cbo says that the most generous voucher provided by ryan s plan would cover percent of the cost of the average private plan for a in
ryan wanted instead a subsidy that will pay part but probably not all the cost of a person s health care insurance
that s why our budget saves medicare by using competition to weed out inefficient providers improve the quality of health care for seniors and drive costs down
