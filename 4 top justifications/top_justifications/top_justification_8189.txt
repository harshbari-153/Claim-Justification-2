Says New START, passed while Clinton was secretary of state, is a "treaty cutting Russiaâ€™s nuclear arms."
clinton said new start passed while she was secretary of state was a treaty cutting russia s nuclear arms
clinton is referring to the new strategic arms reduction treaty or new start an agreement between russia and the united states designed to limit both countries deployed strategic nuclear weapons
we wanted to look at the treaty cutting russia s nuclear arms which led us to clinton s foreign policy record while secretary of state from through early
clinton s claim that new start cut russia s nuclear arms is imprecise and overstates the treaty s impact
i would say that new start does reduce and limit russian strategic arms but i would not overly hype the depth of the reduction said pifer a clinton supporter who testified before congress in favor of new start
