Says Sen. Sherrod Brown voted to keep "an extreme, job-killing Internal Revenue Service paperwork mandate."
brown the nrsc said in a news release voted to keep an extreme internal revenue service paperwork mandate
but by saying brown voted in favor of an extreme paperwork mandate the nrsc exaggerates that single vote distorts its context and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression
brown and other democrats voted against it brown s objection was according to discussions we had with him and his communications director
about minutes after voting no brown voted yes on a different amendment to do the same thing kill the paperwork requirement
sherrod brown is up for to another term
