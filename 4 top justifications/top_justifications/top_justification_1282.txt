"You see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States, and you don't see any American cars in Korea."
overall though we found little dispute that obama statement you see a whole bunch of korean cars here in the united states and you do see any american cars in korea is largely correct if you account for the complexity of international trade
for one thing there are not clear categories of american cars and korean cars
part of the reason i want to pass this trade deal is you see a whole bunch of korean cars here in the united states and you do see any american cars in korea
finally we wanted to address the point of whether american made cars are rarely seen in korea
it possible that some of the cars the united states sold to korea could be cars
