Democrats compare the infrastructure programs in the stimulus to the Eisenhower interstate program, "but he proposed a $500 billion highway system, and they're going to put $30 billion" into roads and bridges.
they keep comparing this to eisenhower but he proposed a billion highway system and they going to put billion in roads and bridges mica said
in making their case for the economic stimulus bill president obama and democrats in congress have been saying the bill will make an investment in the nation infrastructure similar to president eisenhower creation of the interstate highway system in the
so mica is right on the billion for the current stimulus bill but the billion interstate cost he cites is the ultimate cost not the original proposal from eisenhower
first mica is correct that the highway portion of the stimulus is billion according to the house appropriations committee summary of the bill
eisenhower estimated the interstate portion of his plan would cost billion over years billion in today dollars
