Says Raz Simone "conquered" part of Seattle, handed out guns to form a paramilitary force that murdered three people, robbed the locals and walked away without being questioned.
a facebook post says raz simone conquered part of seattle handed out guns to form a paramilitary force that murdered three people robbed the locals and walked away without being questioned
the claim says simone handed out guns to form a paramilitary force that murdered three people but there s little evidence for that description of events
one such viral facebook post has a photo of a man with the words remember me i conquered part of seattle handed out guns to form a paramilitary force that murdered three people including a child robbed the locals and i walked away without being questioned
however we did not find evidence to support the claim that the gun simone gave out was linked to shootings that occured in and near chop or that a paramilitary force carried out the shootings
some of the protesters served as armed guards within chop and washington state allows the open carry of guns
