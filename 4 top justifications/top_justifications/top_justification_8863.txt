Says a pro-Democratic ad is "false" for saying that he allowed two disgraced staffers in 2012 to "resign."
tillis ad called a ad false for saying that he allowed two disgraced staffers in to resign
the ad also specified that the staffers charles thomas and amy hobbs resigned
org and the washington post fact checker expressed skepticism about tillis ad his office now appears to be backing off the term fired
but the news coverage at the time painted a different picture he accepted their resignations
and in any case tillis response ad was not aired with the forced resignations terminology that tillis office began using after the fact
