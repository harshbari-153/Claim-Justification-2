a greater wisconsin committee ad said sheriff david clarke advised citizens to point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger because is not our best option
specifically has clarke advised citizens to point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger because is not our best option
the other clarke quote in the ad point the barrel center mass and pull the trigger is in fact clarke s advice to citizens
after clarke s radio spot milwaukee mayor tom barrett criticized him saying if there s an emergency i want people to call but sheriff clarke is discouraging people from calling it s just wrong
but sheriff david clarke says is not our best option
