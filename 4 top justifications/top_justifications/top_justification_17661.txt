In Russia "all people are absolutely equal regardless of their religion, sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation," while "70 countries of the world have criminal liability for homosexuality."
but putin also was far too rosy in his depiction of how the country treats gays and lesbians when he said all people are absolutely equal regardless of their religion sex ethnicity or sexual orientation
in our country all people are absolutely equal regardless of their religion sex ethnicity or sexual orientation
putin said countries criminalize homosexuality and russia isn t one of them
however while homosexuality is not outright criminal in russia there are many elements of de facto criminalization
while criminalization is the most blatant form of homophobia the report says countries which decriminalized homosexuality in the recent past such as russia are sadly seeking to discrimination based on sexual orientation both at the national level by way of laws against lgbti activism preposterously defined as homosexual propaganda and at the international level in the name of tradition
