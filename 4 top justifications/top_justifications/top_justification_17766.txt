Michigan used a mathematical "key" to manipulate vote totals in 2020 election.
no michigan did use an algorithm to manipulate election results
in a youtube video frank claims his analysis of michigan s election results shows that the election outcome was decided at the ahead of time using a mathematical key to manipulate vote totals
but voters in michigan can register to vote right up through and on election day and thousands took advantage of this right in the november election
while the analysis is new it boils down to a familiar falsehood that michigan s election was tainted by widespread misconduct and fraud
in an email to politifact michigan becker explained that such a conspiracy would have had to be carried out by thousands of people and leave behind a mountain of evidence meddling with the voter file extra ballots that couldn t be explained voters who tried to vote but couldn t because someone else had cast their ballots and audits confirming tabulators were tampered
