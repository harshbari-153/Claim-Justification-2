Half of children struck by cars near schools are hit by parents driving children to school.
safety group says percent of children hit by vehicles near schools are struck by parents of other schoolchildren
a good example is this tantalizing statistic posted on the city of portland s safe routes to school program summary page nationally of children who are hit by cars near schools are hit by cars driven by parents of other students
and while the number on its face seems to make sense who is most likely to be driving near schools than parents the figure begged even more questions how many children are hit by cars each year what is the sample size and how did they track the numbers to figure that parents of other children were involved in half of those cases in short is this percentage accurate politifact oregon set to find out
reducing the need for children to be driven to and from school means fewer cars on the road and fewer opportunities for crashes
anderson said the city doesn t track the number of children hit by cars near schools so we have no idea whether the national number is true in portland
