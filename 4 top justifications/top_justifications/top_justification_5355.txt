Georgiaâ€™s CRCT "set some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation."
there s ample evidence that for years georgia s crct set some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation as research has repeatedly shown and state superintendent richard woods stated last week
our previous assessment the crct set some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation and that can not continue woods said in the press release announcing the results
but it said a comparison with national tests showed that georgia set a low bar for proficiency on the crct and still ranked in the bottom half of national comparisons on naep
with all that said did the crct really set some of the nation s lowest expectations for student proficiency as woods suggests keep in mind that an easy test can still be failed
georgia had the lowest numeric grade reading expectations in the nation proficiency by naep standards was a scale score equivalent of or better
