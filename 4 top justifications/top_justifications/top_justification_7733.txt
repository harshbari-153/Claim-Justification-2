"In this bill that I’ve just signed, we don’t cut anybody’s salary. We don’t take away their pension. And we don’t destroy their health care."
so kasich is correct to say the bill does not take away any worker s pension
in this bill that i ve just signed we don t cut anybody s salary
we don t take away their pension
impact on pensions kasich was correct when he said the bill does not take away worker pensions
the governor is correct here too because the bill does not change health care benefits
