despite what video implies joe biden didn t confuse son with grandson
a usa today story said joe biden s reference was to his grandson hunter and a new york post story said the grandson accompanied biden at the service
biden has a son named hunter but despite the impression the video might leave biden was referring in that speech to his grandson who goes by the name hunter biden not to his son
the grandson s full name is robert hunter biden ii and he was named after his uncle according to hunter biden and media reports
