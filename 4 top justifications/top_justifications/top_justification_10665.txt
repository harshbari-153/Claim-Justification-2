cannabis may stop coronavirus from infecting people study finds
the headline of an article shared on facebook said cannabis may stop coronavirus from infecting people study finds
a preliminary study supported researchers theory that certain cannabis extracts could be used as part of a treatment to prevent coronavirus infections
in short the researchers theorize that cannabis extracts could interfere with the virus process of infection in cells but this is based on laboratory testing on specially engineered tissue to fully mimic human organs not testing on humans
in other words despite the headline on the article the study isn t saying cannabis alone could prevent infection
