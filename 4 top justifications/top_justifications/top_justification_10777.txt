"Washington politicians are paid over $200,000 an hour for speeches."
capitol that washington politicians are paid over an hour for speeches
and while washington politicians are paid over an hour for speeches they oppose raising the living wage to an hour
but the language of the ad is much broader than that making three references to washington politicians in general and twice linking them to a per hour payment
politicians trying to get to washington or those who have come from washington certainly can earn such fees but members of the house and senate and top officials in the executive branch are not permitted to accept payment for speeches
can they really accept more than an hour for speeches
