In 2011, Alabama and Massachusetts passed legislation allowing non-citizens who are legal residents to vote in state and local elections.
anastasia williams says two states alabama and massachusetts allow who are living in those states legally to vote in state and local elections
citizens can vote in federal state and local elections in rhode island
if in massachusetts were eligible to vote in state and local elections we thought we would have heard about it
so not only did the two pieces of legislation not become law neither sought to give holders the right to vote in statewide elections
both confirmed that only citizens can vote in their states and both said an amendment to the state constitution would be required to change that
