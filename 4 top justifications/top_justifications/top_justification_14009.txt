"The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois."
the causation standard in indiana is exactly the same as it is in illinois said david menchetti a labor attorney with the chicago firm cullen haskins nicholson menchetti
attorney david menchetti testified before the illinois house labor and commerce committee that the causation standard in indiana is exactly the same as it is in illinois
in legal terms illinois has standard of causation
if indiana is attracting businesses away from illinois because of its low workers compensation insurance premiums and if illinois causation standard is the cause of its high insurance rates could indiana really have the same legal standard as illinois we decided to check
but if indiana and illinois have identical causation standards in their workers compensation statutes why are indiana s insurance premiums so much cheaper than those paid by businesses in illinois
