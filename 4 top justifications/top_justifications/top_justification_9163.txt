Toledo Mayor "Mike Bell (once) lost his job as a firefighter because his city ran out of money."
he starts the discussion saying years ago i lost my job as a firefighter because my city ran out of money
bell was one of toledo firefighters and total city workers laid off in a budget crisis in not long after he went on the job
building a better ohio says toledo once laid off mike bell when the city was out of money
did bell really lose his job in a budget crunch and was it at all related to labor issues so politifact ohio looked deeper into the record
but the claim that bell was once laid off as a firefighter is accurate
