Says Ruth Bader Ginsburg tweeted, "I have information that will lead to the arrest of Hillary Clinton."
don t believe this faked ruth bader ginsburg tweet about hillary clinton
i have information that will lead to the arrest of hillary clinton the tweet says
the late supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg did not run a personal twitter account
one fake post shared the day after ginsburg died evoked a conspiracy linking former democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton to various deaths of former staffers and associates
the person who posted this added touches of flair to make the post look legitimate adding a photo of ginsburg as the avatar and a blue checkmark to indicate a verified twitter account
