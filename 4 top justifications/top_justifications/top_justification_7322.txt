"There currently are 825,000 student stations sitting empty across Florida in every district and at every grade level."
we wanted to check are there empty student stations in every district and at every grade level
so how does the yes on group claim stack up the group claimed there currently are student stations sitting empty across florida in every district and at every grade level based on data cited in february
as part of the argument in favor of changing the rules the yes on group points out that there are hundreds of thousands of empty student stations statewide meaning desks raising the question of why districts should need to make changes to limit class sizes
we asked the yes on group if they actually meant student stations in total across the state of florida rather than the way they wrote it as in every district and at every grade level
but the number of additional student stations statewide is the full story
