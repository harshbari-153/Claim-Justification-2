"U.S. military holding White House for Trumpâ€™s return."
military holding white house for trump s return
that s all wrong and unfounded and so is the claim that the military is controlling the white house awaiting trump s return
no the military doesn t control the white house
the video shows an image of former president donald trump and someone in uniform standing together as a narrator reads the text of a story published on july on a website called real raw news
this particular story contains a number of falsehoods including that president joe biden has never set foot in the white house and that biden has been using director tyler perry s production company to film white house events
