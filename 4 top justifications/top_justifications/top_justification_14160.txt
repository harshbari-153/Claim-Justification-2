"Every child born today inherits a $30,000 share in a national debt that stands at more than $13 trillion."
every child born today pawlenty wrote inherits a share in a national debt that stands at more than trillion
tim pawlenty says every child is born with a share of the debt
remember pawlenty wrote that the national debt stands at more than trillion
if pawlenty wants to stick with the figure he should have said that debt stands at more than trillion
gross federal debt stood at just over trillion which works out to for every american
