"Fewer than 10 percent of those in the House are what anyone would classify as wealthy."
under either measure duncan s claim that fewer than percent of house members are wealthy is way off base
it may be hard for some to believe duncan wrote but fewer than percent of those in the house are what anyone would classify as wealthy
congressman duncan says fewer than percent of house members are wealthy
we ll look first at roll call s list of the wealthiest members of congress since duncan said that is the primary basis for his claim that fewer than percent of house members are wealthy
if one uses this list as a benchmark for deciding which lawmakers are wealthy as duncan apparently did then just percent of the house members would be considered wealthy
