"We never had an earthquake in Youngstown until John Kasich was elected Governor,"
robert hagan says youngstown never had an earthquake until john kasich was elected governor
we never had an earthquake in youngstown until john kasich was elected governor hagan said
was youngstown really until john kasich became the state chief executive on jan
john kasich administration did not react more quickly to smaller earthquakes which had struck the youngstown area in the months preceding the new year s eve
indeed it looks like hagan is right that earthquakes have come to youngstown before march when kasich was governor
