Says JoAnne Kloppenburg’s side had a "3-to-1 money advantage" in the Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign.
charlie sykes says joanne kloppenburg had a advantage in spending over justice david prosser for a seat on the wisconsin supreme court
this is a small category but kloppenburg had a decided edge according to state government accountability board reports of spending through april
amid criticism of politifact wisconsin sykes said it was his good faith impression from about two weeks prior to the election that the kloppenburg side was outspending the prosser side
his assertion may have become an article of faith in some circles on the right but we could find no basis for any spending advantage by kloppenburg much less a to edge
this is the big outside money that came in record amounts for a state judicial race
