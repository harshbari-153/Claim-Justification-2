Says his GOP challenger, Doug MacGinnitie, "hadnâ€™t voted in a Republican primary for almost 20 years until 2008.
during the cobb breakfast kemp could have told voters that macginnitie did not vote in a state republican primary for years
instead he said his opponent did not vote in a republican primary
it correct that primaries often decide elections in areas that lean heavily toward one political party and macginnitie did not vote in state and local races that were important to the republican party
kemp said in a speech posted on youtube that macginnitie failed to vote in republican primaries for two decades
they said that while macginnitie did vote in presidential republican primaries he did start voting in state republican primaries until when he was gearing up to run for higher office
