"The Travis County propositions will not raise your taxes! If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen."
travis forward said in a mailer the travis county propositions will not raise your taxes if you are or older your property taxes are frozen
travis forward a pac said in an october mailer the travis county propositions will not raise your taxes if you are or older your property taxes are frozen
readers asked us to check if the propositions won t raise their taxes and also whether property taxes are frozen for homeowners or older
neither claim holds up we found in that the propositions pose future tax costs for property owners with specific projected amounts driven by the assessed value of properties and the county doesn t freeze taxes for homeowners or older
the freeze claim is inaccurate travis county officials quickly said to our inquiries and it s inaccurate to say the propositions won t cost taxpayers anything extra
