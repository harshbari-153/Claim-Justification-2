no stacey abrams did dismiss agriculture because people can buy food at groceries
she did not ever appear to clarify a statement on who needs agriculture when you can just get food at the store because as best we can tell she never said it
among the salvos lobbed at abrams in the hours after both addresses was the charge that she dismissed agriculture claiming people can buy their food from the grocery instead
agriculture and hospitality are vital sectors of our economy in georgia but we can do more and lead in new sectors as well
