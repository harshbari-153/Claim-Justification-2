Milwaukee has less taxing power than most similar cities and is the only U.S. city of 400,000 or more "that does not have a sales tax or local income tax."
this brings us to barrett s more specific claim that milwaukee is the only city of or more in the nation without a local sales or income tax
barrett said milwaukee faces unusual taxing challenges and is the only city in this country with a population of over that does not have a sales tax or local income tax
we ll assume barrett was referring to cities that don t levy their own local sales tax since otherwise milwaukee wouldn t meet his criteria given that city residents are subject to the county s local sales tax
the first element of barrett s claim is that milwaukee doesn t have the same options for raising tax revenue as other large cities
so barrett is making the general case that milwaukee has less flexibility than its peers while specifically claiming no other city of its size gets by without a local tax of some kind
