rnc chairman says gop convention a super bowl times four
this is a super bowl times four
but is it true politifact florida decided to priebus claim about national political conventions to see if they are indeed four times a super bowl an event tampa is more familiar with having hosted it several times as recently as
the only measure that comes close when considering priebus claim is the number of event days the super bowl is one night the convention is four
that would put the convention on par with super bowls according to pricewaterhousecoopers but below a super bowl according to the more boosterish figures being created by the nfl and the local host committees
