"Sen. Hutchison abandoned Republicans and stood with Democrats to ensure health care legislation would pass quickly."
hutchison abandoned republicans and stood with democrats to ensure health care legislation would pass quickly
did hutchison procedural vote in any way ensure the democrats health care legislation would pass quickly we do see how
significantly hutchison later joined fellow republicans and voted against passage of the democratic health plan
by perry analysis hutchison vote eased the democrats passage of the health care bill she opposed
in claiming that hutchison paved the way for the democratic health bill the perry campaign leaped to a conclusion not supported by the facts
