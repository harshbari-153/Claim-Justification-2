If the Trans-Pacific Partnership "is fast-tracked through the Senate, it won't receive a committee assignment" and the consideration will include "no debate."
the chain email said that if the treaty the partnership is through the senate it wo receive a committee assignment and the agreement will have no debate
the email goes on to say if this treaty is through the senate it wo receive a committee assignment and it will be subjected to a straight vote with no debate
while these rules do curb lawmakers ability to shape the agreement s terms the email is simply wrong to claim that legislation stemming from a trade agreement wo receive a committee assignment and that the agreement will have no debate
first whatever comes out of the partnership negotiation won t be a treaty as the email claims
chain email says major pacific trade deal could be taken up in senate without committee review or debate
