"Iâ€™ve got 15 days from my announcement to file paperwork with the FEC!"
kid rock said i ve got days from my announcement to file paperwork with the fec
first of all i ve got days from my announcement to file paperwork with the fec he wrote without mentioning a specific report that he was refuting
if a person has announced or is acting like a candidate and has passed that threshold becomes a candidate and the requirement to register with and report to the fec kicks in ingram told us via email
the fec website notes in its quick answers to candidate questions that how much money a potential candidate gets for or spends on a campaign determines the deadline for when they must file paperwork not simply announcing an intention to run for office
ten days after that the committee must register a statement of organization
