Says Republican Rep. Charlie Dent wants to kick the Freedom Caucus out of the Republican conference "for voting our conscience."
brat said republicans like dent want to kick the freedom caucus out of the republican conference for voting our conscience
but that s not the same thing as dent saying on the record that he wants to kick the freedom caucus out of the conference for voting their conscience or that they need to be punished
we were curious about brat s claim that dent wants to give the freedom caucus the boot
that doesn t mean dent is a fan of the freedom caucus
dent is critical of the freedom caucus but he told us he does not want to excommunicate them nor could we find evidence that he s expressed the desire to in the past
