Paul Ryanâ€™s budget "keeps the Obamacare taxes and spending cuts that paid for Obamacare, but then cuts all of the benefits."
scott said the house budget keeps the obamacare taxes and spending cuts that paid for obamacare but then cuts all of the benefits
he keeps all of the obamacare taxes and spending cuts that paid for obamacare but then cuts all of the benefits scott said
ryan s budget which also would end obamacare passed without a single supportive democratic
so scott is correct that ryan in writing the house budget calls for the end of obamacare but relies on revenue estimates that include obamacare
but the ryan budget does not name even one loophole or deduction it would axe to pay for reducing rates and make up for trillion in lost obamacare revenue
