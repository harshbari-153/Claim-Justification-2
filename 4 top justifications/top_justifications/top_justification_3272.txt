If the voting bill H.R. 1 is passed, "absentee ballots would be mailed out to anyone without proof of the voterâ€™s identity."
but here we will focus on the statement that if the bill is passed absentee ballots would be mailed out to anyone without proof of the voter s identity
is passed absentee ballots would be mailed out to anyone without proof of the voter s identity
absentee ballots would be mailed out to anyone without proof of the voter s identity
and under the bill those mail ballots would be sent to registered voters who want them not anyone
but this provision doesn t support the claim in the video that absentee ballots are being mailed out
