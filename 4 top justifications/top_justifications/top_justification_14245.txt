Photo shows Angela Merkel, Theresa May and Dalia Grybauskaitė as teenagers.
the woman on the left in the photo is angela merkel when she was years old
a photo of a cozy trio is being shared on social media and characterized as a snapshot of three world leaders as teenagers german chancellor angela merkel theresa may the former british prime minister and dalia grybauskaitė the former president of lithuania
photo shows angela merkel but not other leaders
we didn t find any photos of grybauskaitė as a teenager but photos of may around the time this photo was taken do not resemble the person pictured next to merkel
it s extremely unlikely that two public figures like may and grybauskaitė would not also be identified in the photo alongside merkel if in fact they were in the photo alongside merkel
