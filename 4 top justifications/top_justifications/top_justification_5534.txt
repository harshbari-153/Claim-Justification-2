"The FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton ... and discovered another 650,000 emails."
as you know the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clinton and discovered you heard this yesterday it s hard to believe and discovered another emails
trump said the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clinton
trump and other republicans have said the fbi has reopened the investigation into clinton while the clinton camp and others reject that characterization pointing out neither comey s letter to congress nor a memo he sent to fbi employees uses the word
the emails were discovered in a separate investigation and it is not clear just how many are related to clinton and how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the fbi
trump is less accurate when he suggests the fbi has discovered hundreds of thousands of new emails relevant to the clinton case
