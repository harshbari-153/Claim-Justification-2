SaysÂ Joe Manchin displayed an "unwillingness to change the failed Obamacare."
morrisey said manchin displayed an unwillingness to change the failed obamacare
however it is wrong to say that manchin was unwilling to change the affordable care act
manchin did oppose the various repeal efforts but he has worked actively to promote incremental changes to obamacare not only rhetorically but also by backing bipartisan bills intended as efforts to modify obamacare without scuttling it
patrick morrisey says joe manchin wo budge on obamacare ignoring bipartisan efforts
but he isn t really right about manchin s positions on gorsuch and modifying obamacare officially known as the affordable care act
