Says House Republicans "tried to change the definition of rape."
our rating moore said house republicans tried to change the definition of rape
did house republicans try to redefine what constitutes rape and as the claim suggests thus affect what would put a perpetrator in prison definition evolves we begin by noting that the definition of rape has not been constant
in other legislation they have even tried to change the definition of rape
so although moore s statement was broad house republicans tried to change the definition of rape what she cites as evidence is much narrower having to do with how rape is defined when federal money is used to pay for abortions
but the claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression the house republicans effort was not to change the definition of rape per se but rather to restrict the use of federal funds in abortions
