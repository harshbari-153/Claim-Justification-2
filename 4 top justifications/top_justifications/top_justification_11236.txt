Drilling in ANWR would have minimal impact, covering only "2,000 out of 20-million acres."
anwr comprises about acres
in the house endorsed the limited anwr drilling plan but it died during negotiations with the senate on a broader energy bill
palin and other lawmakers now say new technologies including directional drilling would probably make viable energy development possible on a footprint even smaller than acres
palin is technically correct that viable drilling operations could be confined to a small portion of the refuge
but to take full advantage of the oil resources in anwr would almost certainly require an extensive network of roads pipelines and related infrastructure that could possibly be contained on such a footprint
