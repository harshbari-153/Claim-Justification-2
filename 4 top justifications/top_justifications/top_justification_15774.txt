opponents of section complain of state expense yet their only cost is the paper postage and manpower required to send copies of legislation to the federal government for reviews hardly a punishment lewis wrote
lewis said that opponents of section of the voting rights act which requires certain jurisdictions to obtain preclearance from the federal government to implement elections changes are wrong when they say adhering to the requirements can be expensive
they also cite the high cost for adhering to section requirements when states or jurisdictions want to make changes to their elections processes
costs associated with voting rights act can vary by case
it involves jurisdictions submitting proposed voting changes to the civil rights division of the department of justice for review
