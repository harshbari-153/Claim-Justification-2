"Head of Pfizer research: Covid vaccine is female sterilization."
the blog post says head of pfizer research covid vaccine is female sterilization
head of pfizer research covid vaccine is female sterilization reads an inaccurate headline on a blog called health and money news
a doctor whose linkedin profile says he worked at pfizer nine years ago as a chief scientific officer has raised concerns that a vaccine could make women infertile if their immune systems target a certain protein
no pfizer s head of research didn t say the vaccine will make women infertile
while the headline refers to sterilization the post uses softer language referring to the possibility of infertility caused by the vaccine
