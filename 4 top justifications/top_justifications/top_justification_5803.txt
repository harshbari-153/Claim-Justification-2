"Every person on death row was a foster kid."
every person on death row was a foster care kid
stephen wise says everybody on death row was in foster care
perhaps wise was just repeating dunlavy comment from or perhaps he is privy to other information that every person on death row was a foster kid
trying to maintain my wit i answered i research that but you all might find it interesting that recent research shows that every person currently on death row in florida spent time in foster care
i can assure you not everyone on death row has been in the foster care system lenamon said in a phone interview
