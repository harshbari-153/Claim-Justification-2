The Dow Jones Industrial Average "jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history."
trump said the dow jones industrial average jumped points in last weeks record fastest point move in history
jumped points in last weeks record fastest point move in history
jumped points in last weeks record fastest point move in history
we wondered whether trump was accurate that the dow s move in five weeks was a jump of record proportions
