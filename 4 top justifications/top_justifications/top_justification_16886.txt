a facebook post claims to show a photo of a white man smiling while holding a black man with a bloody face
but you want us to forget about this said text above a photo that shows a black man with a bloody face being grabbed up by a white man who appears to be looking at the photographer and either smiling or grimacing
a facebook post gives wrong impression of photo of black man with bloody face and two white men
there are two white men in the photo one has a stern look on his face
