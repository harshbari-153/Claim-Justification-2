"Obama has maintained a friendship with a now convicted felon."
the first line reads obama has maintained a friendship with a now convicted felon
but the gop says it only meant that obama had in the past maintained a friendship with rezko which he certainly did
although the gop support material for its claim that obama has maintained a friendship with rezko relates much of this prior relationship the words has maintained suggests that obama has an ongoing friendship with rezko
any implication that obama continues to maintain a friendship with rezko getting together even speaking on the phone is misleading
in a lengthy interview with the chicago published march obama detailed a relationship that dated back to when obama was finishing law school at harvard and rezko approached him about coming to work for his development company
