One-third of the economic stimulus package was tax cuts.
for instance even in the stimulus plan a full third of that was tax cuts
is stewart right that tax cuts account for a third of the stimulus plan
stewart claims that the stimulus bill is tax cuts
but calculating the cost of the true tax cuts in the stimulus is a bit more complicated
so tax cuts at least the way they been defined by the obama administration make up for slightly more than of the bill
