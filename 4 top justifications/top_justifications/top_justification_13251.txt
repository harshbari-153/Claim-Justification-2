Says that Rick Santorum "voted for the unions over FedEx."
but in fact he was a big labor republican in pennsylvania and i suspect when you get to memphis and you say to people gee this is a guy who wanted to guarantee that fedex give in to the unions santorum won t be as popular the following morning
rick santorum as a big labor republican the kind of apparent oxymoron that tends to catch our attention
asked specifically about santorum s votes in favor of the ruling of the senate chair and on cloture which seemed to side with the faction caldwell said the question is whether he was with labor or with fedex rival ups as a corporation
however santorum voted for the entire faa reauthorization act and the union with the most to gain in the procedural brouhaha with fedex does not believe santorum s vote had anything to do with supporting the labor cause
specifically gingrich said he voted for the unions over fedex
