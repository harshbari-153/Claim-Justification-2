As a result of climate change, ice fishermen in Wisconsin "are already noticing fewer days they can be out on our ice covered lakes."
this claim caught our attention ice fishermen are already noticing fewer days they can be out on our ice covered lakes
the number of days that the lakes have ice on them making them safe for ice fishing has declined
is he right about climate change and fewer days on lakes
overall the average number of days of ice cover on the madison lakes has decreased by around days over the past years
with climate change models predicting warmer temperatures we can expect to see a trend towards fewer days of lakes as each year passes
