we have seized more currency more drugs more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country s history napolitano said
to sum up the data dhs gave us is not enough to prove definitively that napolitano s claim that the agency has seized more currency more drugs more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country s history
it s extremely difficult to calculate the total amount of drugs entering the country
has the country s haul of contraband really reached such historic highs we asked the department of homeland security for proof
also the seized contraband is likely such a small percentage of what crosses the border that the increase s impact on the illegal drug trade is slight
