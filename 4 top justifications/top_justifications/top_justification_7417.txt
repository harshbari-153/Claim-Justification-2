"Martin Luther King was a Republican."
republican travis rowley says martin luther king was a republican
but in king son martin luther king iii said it was disingenuous to imply that my father was a republican
it seems like a fitting moment to remind everyone that martin luther king was a republican and if alive would probably have come to his own party defense by telling harpootlian to stop being such a whiny little weasel wrote rowley
martin luther king sr
martin luther king jr
