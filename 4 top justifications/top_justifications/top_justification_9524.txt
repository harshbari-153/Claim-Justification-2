we all get that magazine governing and they ve estimated that in the states that don t expand medicaid a minimum they said of percent of rural hospitals will close in those states
we asked the association if it s made any predictions on the percentage of rural hospitals that will close in states that don t expand medicaid
saslaw says governing magazine has estimated that percent of rural hospitals will close in states that don t expand their medicaid rolls
but contrary to saslaw s assertion the story didn t estimate that percent of the rural hospitals would shut down in states that don t expand medicaid
saslaw says percent of rural hospitals will close in states that do expand medicaid
