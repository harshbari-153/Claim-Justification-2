Says Donald Trump thinks "a grown man pretending to be a woman (should) be allowed to use the women's restroom."
a cruz ad said trump thinks a grown man pretending to be a woman should be allowed to use the women restroom
should a grown man pretending to be a woman be allowed to use the women restroom the same restroom used by your daughter your wife donald trump thinks so reads the ad which first aired april and includes a clip of trump suggesting people use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate
but trump did not say he supports a man pretending to be a woman using a woman restroom
the ad quotes trump as saying on april people go they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate
here s one if donald trump dresses up as hillary clinton he still can t go to the girls bathroom
