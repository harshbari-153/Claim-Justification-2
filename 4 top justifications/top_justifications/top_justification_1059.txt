Says Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has "ties to the Muslim Brotherhood."
duffy says clinton aide huma abedin has ties to the muslim brotherhood
no evidence to back claim that top hillary clinton aide huma abedin has ties to muslim brotherhood
duffy asked why the alleged muslim brotherhood connections to huma abedin are not being talked about
and when we asked for backup duffy s office cited to us only a new york post column that didn t directly allege any ties between abedin and the muslim brotherhood
the piece said abedin s father syed zaynul abedin founded the institute for muslim minority affairs that the institute was supported by the muslim world league and that the league has been called perhaps the most significant muslim brotherhood organization in the world
