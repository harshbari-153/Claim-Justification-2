"We are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin."
to that end walker declared we are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of wisconsin
walker said in his budget address and in the weeks and months since that wisconsin is investing more in education than ever in the history of the state
more money than ever before
for starters we took walker s statement to mean education not a picture that would include colleges and universities and the we to refer to money directly from the state
in wisconsin state aid doesn t tell the full story in terms of how much money is going to schools
