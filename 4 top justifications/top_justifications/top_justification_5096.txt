"Eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending."
it the last part the notion that eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending that caught our eye
critics say that focusing on earmarks is a symbolic action that obscures the harder choices that will be needed to reduce the federal deficit and cut into the national debt
providing the obama administration with greater authority to direct spending does not accomplish this goal and eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending
under the status quo however our experts agreed that lugar is largely correct ending earmarks wo directly reduce spending only it
made a stark point cutting earmarks wo actually save money
