"From a standpoint of the county government, neither school system has received an increase in funding over the past six years."
from a standpoint of the county government jones said neither school system has received an increase in funding over the past six years
they point out that even while the county has stopped increasing school funding revenues for county government have been steadily increased
but jones is right because the county has not increased schools funding since the fiscal year this fiscal year marks a sixth straight year the county has declined to increase its funding of schools
some recent changes in the state s funding formula have increased state funding for larger school districts like those in shelby davidson hamilton and knox county
so education funding as a percentage of the county budget has actually dropped
