GM has "repaid our government loan, in full, with interest, five years ahead of the original schedule."
ceo says gm has repaid government loans in full
gm had until to pay back those loans
that why i here to announce we have repaid our government loan in full with interest five years ahead of the original schedule
at the end of the day it shows that gm found itself with enough of a surplus to pay back this piece of government support
so the loan portion of the gm bailout was in fact settled with interest five years ahead of schedule
