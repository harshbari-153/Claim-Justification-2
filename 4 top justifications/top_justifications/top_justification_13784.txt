"Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence."
since the sandy hook tragedy more than seven children per day have died from gun violence
do seven children per day die from guns
if considering only elementary school aged children the total who die in connection with guns would be roughly one every four days still a tragic number but not close to seven per day
but we found a similar statistic on the organization s website every day children and teens die from gun violence
it notes that children and teens are included in the seven deaths per day
