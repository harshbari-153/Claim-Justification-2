On the day the House voted on the climate change bill, "there was not even a copy of the bill in the well of the House, which is standard. It wasn't even written."
then came this lament from rush limbaugh on the day the house voted on the climate change bill there was not even a copy of the bill in the well of the house which is standard
so we found it hard to believe that there was not one complete copy of the plan in the chamber the day the house passed the bill
limbaugh claimed that there was not even a copy of the bill in the well of the house
but the congressional record and our interview with the parliamentarian show that limbaugh is wrong to say that there was no copy of the bill in the chamber during the vote
limbaugh claims the climate bill was written when it came up for a vote
