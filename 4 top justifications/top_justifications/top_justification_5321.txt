Paul Ryan "is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy's bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees."
the constitutional rights pac said ryan is one of only six house republicans who voted for teddy kennedy bill to force christian employers to hire lgbt employees
he is one of only six house republicans who voted for teddy kennedy s bill to force christian employers to hire lgbt employees
paul ryan one of few in gop to vote force christian employers to hire gay people pac says
so it s a stretch to say the enda bill ryan voted for would force christian employers or any employers for that matter to hire lesbian gay or bisexual people
the thrust of the pac s claim is that the bill ryan backed would have forced christian employers to hire people who are lesbian gay bisexual or transgender
