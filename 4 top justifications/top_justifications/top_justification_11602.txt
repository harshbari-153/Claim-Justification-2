"Since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event where you don't have to pay admission or be on an approved list."
ross said since scott walker has not done a public event where you do have to pay an admission or be on an approved list
no i mean since scott walker has not done a public event where you do have to pay admission or be on an approved list
but in terms of events walker himself holds his campaign team cited campaign events at which registration is requested but not required a ceremony that the governor office and a news event that had not been announced to the general public
even walker events have all been held at private businesses that do not allow the public to attend
but these events held by walker rather than him attending events staged by others were not open to the public or to the press only to people who were invited
