"We lost more jobs in this great recession than the last four recessions combined."
during the april edition of abc s this week with christiane amanpour columnist george will said during the show s roundtable segment that we lost more jobs in this great recession than the last four recessions combined
but we thought we d at least see whether the recession registered more jobs lost on a percentage basis than any of the prior ones
to june jobs lost so the numbers show that will is right about more jobs were lost during the great recession than in the previous four recessions combined
george will says most recent recession killed more jobs than previous four recessions combined
we knew the most recent recession was bad but we hadn t realized it was so bad in comparison to other recent recessions
