Charges on the Republican Party of Florida credit card were made with "my money."
what we know rubio was among a group of at least a florida lawmakers given gop credit cards in recent years allowing them to use party money for certain expenses
but the fact that there were purchases that appear to be personal and were paid for by the republican party undercuts his claim
if it was a question between party expenses or personal expenses i would err on the side of protecting party money by paying personally for those charges
some other party charges according to a miami
our ruling to recap rubio said the charges were made with my money
