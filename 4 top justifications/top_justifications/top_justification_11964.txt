Photo shows an electric car charging station that uses "12 gallons of diesel fuel per hour, and it takes three hours to fully charge a car to get 200 miles. That's 36 gallons for 200 miles. 5.6 mpg."
that generator uses gallons of diesel fuel per hour and it takes three hours to fully charge a car to get miles the text reads
a facebook post claims an electric car charging station in texas runs on a diesel generator and that a car has to charge for three hours and use gallons of diesel fuel to travel miles
the experiment involved using the charger to charge electric cars most of them teslas for one hour each and measuring how much energy was added to the battery during charging
the accompanying text claims electric cars are more inefficient because charging stations use diesel fuel generators to produce electricity
edwards experiment found that in most instances using the generator to charge a car consumed less fuel than a similarly sized diesel car would to travel the same distance
