"Non-essential people get to file for unemployment and make two to three times more than normal," but essential workers still on the job get no pay raise.
a facebook post said that people get to file for unemployment and make two to three times more than normal but essential workers still on the job get no pay raise
only a few get an unemployment pay raise
people get to file for unemployment and make two to three times more than normal
but even with the bonus workers who lose their jobs will receive less money on unemployment than they did on the job
it is possible for workers in that pay range to receive unemployment payments that are two or nearly three times higher than what they were paid on the job
