Social Security and other federal checks may not go out on Aug. 3 if the debt ceiling is not increased.
barack obama said social security and other federal checks may not go out on if the debt ceiling is not increased
the president is probably justified in saying that the possibility of an debt ceiling jeopardizes social security checks after all it has happened before so no one knows for sure
obama i can not guarantee that those checks go out on august if we have resolved this issue because there may simply not be the money in the coffers to do it
obama well this is not just a matter of social security checks
even if the government has the authority to prioritize payments such as social security checks doing so would still entail some downsides and some of these might be considered politically or practically untenable
