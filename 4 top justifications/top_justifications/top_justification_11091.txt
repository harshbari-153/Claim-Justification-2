Solar and wind energy are "both cheaper than nuclear right now."
instead we ll focus on his claim that solar and wind energy are both cheaper than nuclear right now
bill clinton says wind solar are already cheaper than nuclear energy
our ruling clinton was correct about wind energy being cheaper than nuclear right now at least the onshore kind
but for now nuclear beats the cheapest form of solar energy on price
for instance if the externalities were found to be sufficiently low for solar and sufficiently high for nuclear he said solar might end up being cheaper than nuclear
