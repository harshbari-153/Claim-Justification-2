"Twice as much (federal) money is going back to Hawaii, Virginia and Alaska than is coming home to Oregon."
it is correct that those states get twice as much as oregon per person
federal spending per person in oregon is according to the census bureau compared with in hawaii in virginia and in alaska
census bureau report that shows oregon fifth from the bottom on federal money spent per person in the state
it is insulting to oregonians that ron wyden keeps voting for deficit spending despite knowing that twice as much money is going back to hawaii virginia and alaska than is coming home to oregon
huffman is right that oregon lags behind other states but he stretches his point by singling out the three highest states for comparison and by saying that oregon was all but forgotten
