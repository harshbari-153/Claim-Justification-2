"We took Wisconsin from the Bottom 10 for business to the Top 10."
we took wisconsin from the bottom for business to the top
walker said wisconsin is now a top state for business when it used to be in the bottom
it is the only prominent national ranking to rank wisconsin in the top aside from an index that focuses narrowly on small businesses
what does it mean to be in the top for business and who decides that let s dig in
wisconsin is not one of the states to do business in but it is one that is now competitive where i think a decade ago wisconsin struggled with its tax structure and economic incentive programs
