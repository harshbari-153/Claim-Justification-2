Says Ann Kuster said the debate over Americaâ€™s debt limit is not an important issue of the day.
our ruling bass said that kuster said the debate over america s debt limit is not an important issue of the day
after filing to run democrat annie kuster stated that debate over america s debt limit is not an important issue of the day bass said in an email to the press
she ended with another statement about congress focus on other subjects that aren t issues of the day however kuster does not say the debt limit is one of them
her comments indicate she is unhappy with bickering over the debt but she does go so far as to say the debt is not an important issue
it skipped over the introductory part that says people s needs are not being met and they omitted the and which separates her two statements about bickering over debt limits and arguing over unimportant issues
