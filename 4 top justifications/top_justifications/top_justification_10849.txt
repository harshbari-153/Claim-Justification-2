as a general notion the idea that preventive care saves money for families for businesses for government for everybody is no more true today than it was in
it s been a staple of health care politics for years the claim that preventive care saves money
we fought for this because it saves lives and it saves money for families for businesses for government for everybody
article in the new england journal of medicine that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care
but while there s little doubt that preventive care saves lives the money is a different story
