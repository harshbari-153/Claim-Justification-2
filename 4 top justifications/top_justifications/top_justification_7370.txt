Says Barack Obama "acknowledged over 20 times" that his administrationâ€™s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans "immigration edict was a violation of law and the separation of powers."
paxton said obama acknowledged over times that his administration s dapa immigration edict was a violation of law and the separation of powers
here are a few of the times when obama seemed to say that he lacked independent legal authority to act on immigration
but obama had often said through march that absent congressional action he couldn t do more by himself to protect immigrants living in the country without legal permission
like mccaul we found abbott overstated the confirmed instances of obama indicating he couldn t independently do more to prevent deportations
greg abbott to the effect that obama had many times said he couldn t act to protect immigrants from deportation unless congress revised immigration laws
