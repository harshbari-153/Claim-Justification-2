Says Romney and Ryan "both backed proposals that would outlaw abortions even in cases of rape or incest."
our ruling barack obama said in a television ad that romney and ryan romney both backed proposals that would outlaw abortions even in cases of rape or incest
the ad is called dangerous and it says romney and running mate paul ryan both backed proposals that would outlaw abortions even in cases of rape or incest
recently the obama camp tweeted that ryan would ban all abortions even in cases of rape and incest
obama ties romney and ryan to abortion ban with no rape incest exceptions
correction we have corrected this item to note that mitt romney has said he would allow abortion when the life of the mother is in jeopardy
