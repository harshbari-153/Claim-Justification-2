"We have invested record funding in protecting our environment."
how we have invested record funding in protecting our environment
during his state of the state speech scott said we have invested record funding in protecting our environment
but we hadn t heard scott s claim that during his tenure we have invested record funding to protect the environment so we decided to that claim
we asked scott s spokesman to provide us with documentation to support his claim that during his tenure florida had invested record funding on environmental protection
we interviewed several environmentalists who pointed to scott s lack of investment in protecting the environment
