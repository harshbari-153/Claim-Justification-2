Florida teachers are "already paid $5,000 below the national average."
still gelber said paid which to most people means just salary and there enough for us to assess his claim that florida teachers are paid below the national average
the report shows that in the school year the average teacher salary in florida was slightly more than below the national average
the average teacher salary was in the u
gelber says florida teacher salaries lower than national average
so gelber could have used newer numbers that would better bolster his point that florida teachers are underpaid
