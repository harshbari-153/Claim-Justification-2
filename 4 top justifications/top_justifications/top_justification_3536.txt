Under the "cromnibus" law, taxpayers must guarantee "incredibly risky" derivatives deals made by the nation's largest banks.
pocan said that under the federal cromnibus law taxpayers must guarantee incredibly risky derivatives deals made by the nation largest banks
new law means taxpayers must back banks risky derivatives deals mark pocan says
so pocan is claiming that derivatives are incredibly risky financial ventures
and while it is true that taxpayers bear some risk given that the government guarantees banks as a whole the risk to taxpayers is much less than pocan wants you to think figlewski said
but not all derivatives are considered investments and there is disagreement over just how much risk the new provision poses for taxpayers
