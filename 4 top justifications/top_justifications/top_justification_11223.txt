"Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real."
sanders said not one republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real
he specifically said we do not have one republican candidate for president acknowledging this climate change reality
not one republican recognizes that climate change is real we decided to look at the positions of the gop candidates who were in the race when sanders made his statement
do you think there a reason why not one republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real and that we need to transform our energy system do you think it has anything to do with the koch brothers and exxonmobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system that is what goes on in america
when we asked the sanders campaign about the claim policy director warren gunnels said the reality is that none of the republicans have introduced a plan to solve climate change in a way that would transform our energy system
