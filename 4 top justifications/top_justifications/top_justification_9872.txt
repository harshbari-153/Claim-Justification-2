"We borrow a million dollars every minute."
paul said we borrow a million dollars every minute
there are minutes in a year so borrowing million a minute would mean the government borrows billion a year
of course though it s not as though the country is literally borrowing million every single minute
does the country really borrow a million a minute we decided to check it out
does anybody here think it s a good idea to borrow money from china to send it to pakistan we borrow a million dollars every minute
