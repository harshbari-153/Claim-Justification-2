"No other Northeastern state has passed a photo ID law"
in opposing the bill the rhode island affiliate of the american civil liberties union stated in a news release no other northeastern state has passed a photo id law
but the aclu is factually correct when it states that no other state in the northeast requires photo id
as far as i know there is no northeastern state that has photo id as a requirement agreed sean greene manager of research for the pew center on the states which tracks voter id legislation
now returning to the aclu s claim are there any states with photo id laws in the northeast since the aclu didn t say what it means by northeast we ll use the u
photo id laws differ on what s considered an acceptable form of id and who is exempted from showing one
