"Twitter has suspended the account of Afghanistan’s elected President… and have allowed the Taliban to keep their accounts."
an instagram post claimed that twitter has suspended the account of afghanistan s elected president and have allowed the taliban to keep their accounts
the instagram post implies that twitter suspended these accounts to legitimize the taliban as the rulers of afghanistan but there is no evidence of this
however there are two other accounts affiliated with afghanistan s president and saleh s political party that twitter has suspended
breaking twitter has suspended the account of afghanistan s elected
as the situation in afghanistan continues to evolve we ll have to see whether twitter will continue to allow the taliban on their platform or if their accounts break the website s rules
