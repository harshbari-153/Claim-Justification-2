"Three or four countries" out of roughly 60 in the anti-ISIS coalition "are providing military force."
rubio said that only three or four countries out of roughly in the coalition are providing military force
listen i mean there three or four countries that are providing military force
we decided to look at whether rubio is correct that only three or four countries out of more than in the coalition are providing military force
clearly the united states has been doing the vast majority of operations against isis in syria and the lion s share in iraq
allies taking a significant role in providing military force is tricky due to a lack of transparency among some of the countries that belong to the coalition
