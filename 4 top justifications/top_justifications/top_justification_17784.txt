David Jolly "has used money and power to try to â€¦ drill off our beaches."
crist said jolly has used money and power to try to drill off our beaches
david jolly worked to off our beaches charlie crist says in email
was jolly an advocate for offshore drilling as crist said
so where is crist getting the idea that jolly worked to open up more drilling his campaign s single piece of evidence was one of our own from
his campaign s argument is that jolly technically lobbied on a failed bill that would have potentially expanded offshore drilling
