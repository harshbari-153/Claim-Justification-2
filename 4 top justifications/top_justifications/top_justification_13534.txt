cassidy said in states that have legalized you see steady decreases in youth use if you do it right
indeed material included in the colorado survey characterizes as relatively unchanged the slight variations in teen marijuana use since legalization
as for preliminary state results caulkins said that making recreational marijuana legal for adults has done little to affect use by youth in large part because cannabis was already relatively easy for minors to obtain in those states
while state survey data show no spike in current marijuana use among teens they also fall short of suggesting the downward trajectory cassidy described
