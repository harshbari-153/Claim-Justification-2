Says John Raese said he wants "1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now."
but we were perplexed by his comment we need laser systems put in the sky and we need it right now
we need laser systems put in the sky and we need it right now
the web ad shows video of john raese the republican candidate making these statements we need laser systems put in the sky and we need it right now
getting back to the manchin video raese may have been speaking a little hyperbolically about putting lasers systems in the sky
we are sitting with the only technology in the world that works and it laser technology
