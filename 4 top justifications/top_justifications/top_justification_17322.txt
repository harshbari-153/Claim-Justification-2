"New Zealand let health experts" rather than politicians make decisions about how to deal with COVID-19, "and as of today they have zero COVID cases."
a facebook post claimed that new zealand let health experts rather than politicians make decisions about how to deal with and as of today they have zero covid cases
today i learned that new zealand let health experts make the decisions about how to deal w the pandemic rather than politicians and as of today they have covid cases
as for the whys of new zealand s success both health experts and politicians can be credited along with new zealanders willingness to abide by orders according to a number of news analyses
this isn t to say new zealand which has a population of million has had no cases
bloomfield effectively explained complex health issues and that made new zealanders more compliant in following orders the network reported
