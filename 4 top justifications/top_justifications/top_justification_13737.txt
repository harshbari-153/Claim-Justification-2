The Obama administration "spent more money on the Cash for Clunkers program than the space program."
rubio was quoted saying they spent more money on the cash for clunkers program than the space program
rubio says obama administration spent more on cash for clunkers than space program
spent more on cash for clunkers billion than the obama administration would spend on constellation
the point marco was making is that this president has shown he is willing to spend more money in programs like for clunkers than he is willing to spend on pursuing the next phase of a planned flight program
and the florida today article helps to back that up by noting that he ignored the fact that obama was proposing an increase in nasa overall spending
