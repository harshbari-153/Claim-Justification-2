Says Rick Perry is a 25-year incumbent.
bill white says perry is a incumbent
but describing perry as a incumbent in a critique focused on his governorship blurs the fact that most of the time perry held office he not been governor or in a single elected position
to white campaign the gop governor is perry
another white tactic bringing attention to perry many years as an elected official by calling him a career politician
also questionable is white use of the word incumbent which implies that perry was cemented into place a ago
