In labor negotiations with city employees, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett "demanded concessions that went beyond those mandated" by Gov. Scott Walkerâ€™s collective bargaining law
afscme says milwaukee mayor tom barrett demanded union concessions beyond those in gov scott walker s collective bargaining law
our conclusion afscme said that in labor negotiations barrett demanded concessions that went beyond those mandated by walker s bill severely curtailing collective bargaining
to learn how the union backs up its claim that barrett demanded concessions that went far beyond those mandated by act we turned to richard abelson the veteran head of afscme district council which represents many city employees
did barrett really oppose the bargaining changes and then use them to cut even deeper into union power that question gets to the heart of why many unions some of which sat out the election in which walker defeated barrett are opposed to the milwaukee mayor
when our members who work for the city of milwaukee tried to negotiate with him as walker was ramming through act barrett was interested in working with us
