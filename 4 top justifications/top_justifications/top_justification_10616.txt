"We now have our kids go to school about a month less than most other advanced countries."
we now have our kids go to school about a month less than most other advanced countries obama said
so it certainly accurate to say that kids in the united states go to school fewer days than most other advanced countries
we think obama has a solid argument about american kids going to school fewer days than many other kids but it a stretch to say they go about a month less than students in most other advanced countries
our children spend over a month less in school than children in south korea
students in only about a quarter of those countries go to school close to a month longer than american kids
