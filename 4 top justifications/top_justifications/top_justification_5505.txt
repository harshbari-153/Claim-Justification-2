"I didn't inherit money from my parents."
i did inherit money from my parents
mitt romney says he did inherit money from his parents
did romney the last of george and lenore four children receive no inheritance on his path to wealth romney words
so while he did ultimately benefit from an inheritance we wondered had romney parents wealth helped build his own fortune there no evidence we saw that romney parents helped buy him a business career
so in romney own words he did inherit some funds from his dad
