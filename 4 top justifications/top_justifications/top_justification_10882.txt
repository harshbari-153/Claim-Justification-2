"In the 1990s, the Biden Crime Bill added 100,000 cops to America's streets. As a result, murder and violent crime rates went down eight years in a row."
while it may seem intuitive that putting more cops on the beat would deter crime several government and independent studies have failed to prove a strong link between cops and the percent drop in violent crime rates from to
rather it was likely the result of a complex series of factors including population shifts an improving economy longer prison sentences for violent criminals better policing and changes in drug usecombined to contribute more to the reduction in crime than did cops expenditures
part biden claim that crime rates dropped as a result of those extra officers is in the words of several criminologists absurd simplistic and ridiculous
was indeed a leading advocate for community oriented police services or cops a key part of the crime bill
