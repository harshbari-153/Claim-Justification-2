In contrast to how a Black man who was shot by police was treated, Kenosha police officers "let an armed white supremacist walk right past them after shooting people."
in a tweet moore said in contrast to how a black man who was shot by police was treated kenosha police officers let an armed white supremacist walk right past them after shooting people
the same police department who shot an unarmed black man times in the back for walking away from them just let an armed white supremacist walk right past them after shooting people
a voice can be heard yelling hey he just shot them hey dude right here just shot them another voice on a police loudspeaker is heard saying someone injured straight ahead
he said officers were more focused on the injuries and what happened down the street
the violence came days after blake a black man was shot in the back seven times at range by a kenosha police officer
