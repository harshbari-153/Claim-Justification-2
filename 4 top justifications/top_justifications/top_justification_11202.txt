"Report finds increased risk of spontaneous abortion following COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy" after correcting "major error" in CDC study.
report finds increased risk of spontaneous abortion following vaccination during pregnancy reads the headline on a post from who seeks to summarize the report s findings
cdc study on vaccination and spontaneous abortions did not contain major error
a more precise assessment of whether vaccination before the third trimester increases miscarriage rates would require following these pregnancies to completion
those posts which we had excluded people vaccinated in the third trimester when fetuses are more developed and the risk of miscarriage is reduced
determining the effects of vaccination early in pregnancy means looking only at people who were vaccinated before weeks but it s misleading to apply the narrow denominator of to the preliminary data in the nejm paper
