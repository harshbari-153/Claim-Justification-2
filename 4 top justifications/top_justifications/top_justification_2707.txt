"I have always been focused on reining in the deficit."
let s return to the original statement i have always been focused on reining in the deficit
i have always been focused on reining in the deficit and this is a good place to start for next year s budget debate kohl said in the release
herb kohl says he s always been focused on reducing the federal deficit
always of course is a pretty high standard especially over a career
is he a to the deficit issue or a closet deficit hawk he s something in between based on the ideologically mixed reviews he gets from interest groups and or examination of his voting record
