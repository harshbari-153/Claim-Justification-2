it read congress shall make no law applicable to a citizen of the united states that is not equally applicable to congress
congress shall make no law that applies to its citizens of the united states that does not apply equally to the senators and representatives and congress shall make no law that applies to senators and representatives that does not apply equally to the citizens of the united states
