Says John James "wants to allow insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions."
the attack ad against james claims he wants to allow insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions
the ad features a woman with multiple sclerosis who claims that james wants to allow insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions
james claims that he would cover and protect individuals with preexisting conditions suggests he does not support letting insurance companies deny someone coverage based on their medical history as the afscme ad says
his critics have a legitimate point that he could provide more detail on how he d achieve that position but this ad goes too far in stating that james supports allowing insurance companies to deny coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions
james has said many times that he supports a health insurance system that covers and protects people with preexisting conditions
