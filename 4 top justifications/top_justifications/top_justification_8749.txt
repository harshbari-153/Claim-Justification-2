"Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support."
medicare passed with virtually no republican support
we wondered whether defazio was right that medicare passed with virtually no republican support
peter defazio says medicare passed with virtually no republican support
but many big opponents were conservative democrats and ultimately it s wrong to say as defazio does that medicare passed with virtually no republican support
and as the medicare bill progressed through the house republican support was scant
