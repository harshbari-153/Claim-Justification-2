an official with the conservative heritage foundation tweeted wow xavier becerra falsely claims twice i have never sued any nuns
i have taken on the federal government but i have never sued any affiliation of nuns and my actions have always been directed at the federal agencies because they have been trying to do things that are contrary to the law in california
but becerra did sue nuns
