Says guns are required to be registered.
hawaii and the district of columbia require the registration of all firearms and while california does not have a traditional gun registry it has a similarly functioning system the giffords law center said
only a few states require the registration of some or all firearms
the facebook post in its question form implies that guns are required to be registered but that s not the case nationally
however six states california connecticut hawaii maryland new jersey and new york require the registration of certain firearms such as assault weapons according to the giffords law center which favors laws requiring gun registration
gun owners don t have to catalog their firearms in a national register and the majority of states don t require firearm registration
