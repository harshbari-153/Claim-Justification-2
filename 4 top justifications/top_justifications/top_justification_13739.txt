Gov. McAuliffe's budget would "raid school, other $$ 4 Obamacare in VA."
virginia gop says mcauliffe budget would raid school funds to pay for obamacare
the state republican party tweeted that within mcauliffe s budget we found the part where you were going to raid school other obamacare in va
we asked garren shipley the state gop s communications director for evidence that mcauliffe plans to raid education and other services to pay for obamacare
the gop goes overboard in saying mcauliffe is going to raid schools and other state programs to help pay for medicaid expansion an endeavor that almost entirely would be supported by federal funds
mcauliffe invited some concern by submitting a budget amendment that can be interpreted as giving him authority to transfer money in and out of medicaid from other state programs
