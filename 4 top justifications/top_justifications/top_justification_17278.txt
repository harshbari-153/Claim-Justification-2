On average, college students "are taking six years to get a four-year degree."
johnson said that on average college students are taking six years to get a degree
it s more common for students to take four years to graduate than it is for them to take six years
and for students who started their college studies at a institution rather than a school the average was five years and eight months
so it is more common to earn a degree in four years than it is in five to six years
with the start of school right around the corner we wondered whether it really taking an average of six years to get from high school diploma to bachelor degree
