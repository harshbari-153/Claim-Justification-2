Until the new Iran deal, China and Russia "have never voted with us at the U.N. on any sanctions on Iran in the past."
pelosi wrongly says before nuclear deal russia china had never voted with on iran sanctions
some readers asked us to check whether russia and china have never endorsed sanctions against iran
that may be the case but pelosi statement was absolute china and russia have never voted with us at the u
russia and china often are aligned with the united states interests but they have in fact joined the united states in endorsing sanctions against iran at least eight times before the nuclear deal
frequently efforts to sanction iran were abandoned before a formal vote because any one nation on the un security council has a veto
