"The Senate Finance Committee approved a reform proposal that has both Democratic and Republican support."
just this week the senate finance committee approved a reform proposal that has both democratic and republican support he said
the senate finance committee voted to approve a version of the health care overhaul on a vote of on oct
so obama is technically correct that the proposal had democratic and republican support
but he did mention that it got only one republican vote which meant the nine other gop senators voted against it
health care reform bill not that bipartisan
