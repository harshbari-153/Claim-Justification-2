Says Sen. Ted Cruz used to be "in favor of birthright citizenship" but is now against it.
rubio said cruz used to be in favor of birthright citizenship but is now against it
now cruz didn t offer outright support for birthright citizenship
he was referring to a radio interview in which cruz said birthright citizenship was guaranteed by the amendment and it was better for conservatives to focus on border security instead of trying to change the constitution
i think birthright citizenship as a policy matter does make sense cruz said
rubio mischaracterizes cruz statement on birthright citizenship
