gop chairwoman horn says jeanne shaheen got behind the idea of using the irs to target american citizens for their political views
at a new hampshire republican party fundraiser in august horn told the audience that shaheen signed a letter to the irs asking them to look more closely at some of these c s and that shaheen got behind the idea of using the irs to target american citizens for their political views
shaheen however voiced her opinion about two years after the controversial irs efforts were already under way and there is no evidence that she was aware of alleged irs targeting of conservative groups before it became public in the inspector general s report
when we asked horn for the evidence behind her statement that shaheen got behind using the irs to target specific political groups she pointed to two sources a letter shaheen signed last year and the senator s comments on c organizations during floor speeches
