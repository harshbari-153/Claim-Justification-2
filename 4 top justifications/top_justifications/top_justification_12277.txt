Says Syrian refugees are not being vetted, and "the FBI is not even being told where they are."
mccrory said syrian refugees aren t being vetted and that the fbi doesn t know where they are
so when hillary clinton says they re doing a vetting process of these syrian refugees coming into our state the fbi is not even being told where they are
mccrory says syrian refugees not properly vetted or tracked by the fbi once in the us
the fbi does not continue automatically tracking the movements of all syrian refugees once they pass background checks and settle here but again most of the refugees are children or senior citizens
ted cruz that the head of the fbi has told congress they can not vet those refugees
