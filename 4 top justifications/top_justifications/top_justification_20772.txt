"Today, we (in Pennsylvania)Â have higher unemployment and lower job growth than most."
but his claim that pennsylvania has lower job growth than most gives the impression that most states are seeing stronger job creation
while it s accurate that pennsylvania s economy has not rebounded as quickly as some following the great recession is it true that its unemployment is higher and job growth lower than most

additionally it is also true that total employment in pennsylvania has dropped each month now over the last ten months as pennsylvania s economy continues to fall further behind other states
it s also important to note that some states with greater job growth suffered greater job losses than pennsylvania as davies also pointed out
