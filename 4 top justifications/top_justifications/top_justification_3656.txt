the post which was shared on april reads michigan governor says now is not the time to live by the constitution it s time to put that damn thing in a shredder
no evidence whitmer said it s time to put constitution in a shredder
whitmer s office also told us the statement isn t legitimate
this quote is bogus and only exists in unsourced social media posts
