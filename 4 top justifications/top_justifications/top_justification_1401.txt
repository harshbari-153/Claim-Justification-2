Barnes & Noble and Target have the book "If You Give a Pig the White House" in their childrenâ€™s sections.
boycott barnes and noble target for having this book in the children s section reads an oct
on the barnes noble website the book s title has been tweaked in the bookstore chain s listing emphasis ours if you give a pig the white house a parody for adults
but not everyone is appreciative of this presidential parody of the books especially since some people wrongly think that barnes noble and target are selling it to children
if you give a pig the white house begins a recently published book he ll ask to watch tv
certainly someone browsing in a store could pick up the book and leave it in a different section but there is no evidence this book is being marketed for sale as children s literature in the children s section
