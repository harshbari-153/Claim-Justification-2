Even though Chicago has "the most stringent gun laws on the books," it still "has the highest murder rate" in the country.
johnson said that even though chicago has the most stringent guns laws on the books it still has the highest murder rate in the country
the most stringent gun laws on the books are in places like chicago which has the highest murder rate
is johnson right that chicago has some of the nation s strictest gun laws as well as the highest murder rate and that the two are tied together
in his blog post johnson wrote that chicago has a much higher murder rate than racine and kenosha much smaller cities in wisconsin which the senator said has more reasonable gun laws
so on the first part of johnson s claim chicago has some of the most stringent laws in the united states but does not have the highest murder rate
