Providence has "the lowest crime rate in three decades."
cicilline says providence crime rate is the lowest in years
in addition the mayor website says under his leadership providence has seen crime drop to its lowest rate in years
in the end the number of incidents of crime in providence has declined since cicilline took office and the number of incidents reported in is the lowest in years which makes the mayor claim seem modest
so the decline in the number of crimes reported in providence coincides with a similar although much less steep decline nationally
he repeated it during the july debate with his three democratic challengers saying the city now has the lowest crime rate in three decades
