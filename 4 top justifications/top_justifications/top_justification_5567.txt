"If we just froze spending at 2007 levels ... by 2013 we would balance the budget ... and by 2020 we would cut the national debt in half."
if we just froze spending at levels
and by we would cut the national debt in half he said
by we would balance the budget
both agreed that freezing spending at the level would ultimately lead to erasing the deficit although gordon said it appeared that lemieux analysis omitted a few factors including calculating the debt service from extending the tax cuts provisions in the tax code that usually get extended every year and whether the tax cuts in the stimulus package that are set to expire would continue
so to recap lemieux math is correct if we lowered federal spending to levels and kept it there we could balance the budget and soon have a surplus that we could use to pay down the debt
