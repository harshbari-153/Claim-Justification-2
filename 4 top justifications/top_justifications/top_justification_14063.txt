"States run elections, not the federal government."
states run elections not the federal government
in a twitter retort wisconsin senate republicans claimed that the state runs elections not the federal government
so when it comes down to it saying that either the federal government or the state government runs elections isn t exactly right though they both play a role
so that in itself is at odds with the claim that it s the states that solely run an election
states meanwhile can set their own laws governing how elections are run within the parameters of federal laws
