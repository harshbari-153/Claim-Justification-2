Says he has engaged in the political process "only in the past decade."
it was only in the past decade that i realized the need to also engage in the political process
charles koch wrote that it was only in the past decade that i realized the need to also engage in the political process
we wondered whether koch was accurate when he said that it was only in the past decade that i realized the need to also engage in the political process
charles koch in says his political engagement began only in the last decade
however we don t think most people would naturally assume that s what koch meant when he said he had only recently engaged in the political process
