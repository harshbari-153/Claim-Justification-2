COVID-19â€™s "contagion probability" between two people is 70% if the carrier is not masked, 5% if the carrier is masked, and 1.5% if both parties are.
it gives its highest contagion probability a very precise to a person who has but interacts with others without wearing a mask
a viral social media image claims to show contagion probabilities in different scenarios depending on whether masks are worn
since we couldn t start with the source we reached out to the centers for disease control and prevention to ask if the agency could point to research that would support the graphic s contagion probability percentages
the lowest probability
but although this message has a hint of accuracy the image leaves out important details and context namely the source for the contagion probabilities it seeks to illustrate
