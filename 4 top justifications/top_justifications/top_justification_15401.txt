"There's no negative advertising in my campaign at all."
well look there no negative advertising in my campaign at all mccollum said
mccollum said there no negative advertising in my campaign at all
no negative advertising at all as slightly more than casual observers in the governor race we found mccollum statement puzzling
we should note that these are all advertisements by mccollum campaign and not the groups that are supporting his candidacy
slick or dressing him up in a fedora and trench coat meets a definition of negative advertising
