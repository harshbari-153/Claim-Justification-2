"Public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in Texas."
hashimoto wrote public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in texas
texas law permits long rifles to be toted in public
hashimoto kicked us into action with this factual claim public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in texas
from discussing this over the years with law enforcement officials my understanding is that rifles and shotguns therefore were legal for open carry in texas hashimoto said
up front we recognized numerous news accounts have said the same including a june austin story stating texas law allows owners to openly carry rifles but not sidearms in most situations
