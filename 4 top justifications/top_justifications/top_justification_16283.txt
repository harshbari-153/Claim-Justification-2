"The first slaves shipped to the American Colonies in 1619 were 100 white children from Ireland."
the first slaves shipped to the americans colonies in were white children from ireland reads the text of an image shared on facebook on june
no the first slaves shipped to the american colonies weren t white irish children
the post which features a photo of three children adds that the irish arrived in the colonies four months before the arrival of a the sic first shipment of black slaves
but there weren t really irish or english slaves in colonial america
in reality hogan adds thousands of irish people were sold as servants most voluntarily while approximately africans were shipped to the colonies as slaves always involuntarily
