Proposed fast-track legislation allows presidents to "easily use a future trade deal to override our domestic financial rules."
warren said proposed legislation would allow presidents to easily use a future trade deal to override our domestic financial rules
if passes a republican president could easily use a future trade deal to override our domestic financial rules
the president could bring to congress a trade agreement that requires scaling back to comply with the agreement parameters
and the rules would apply to all trade agreements before congress for the next six years
it s also important to keep in mind that future administrations could go after through the courts by passing domestic legislation or through regulatory discretion all of which would be more much more efficient than going through international negotiations hufbauer said
