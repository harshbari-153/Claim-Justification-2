"Paul Broun Jr. sides with sexual deviants to support sale of 'crush videos.' "
sides with sexual deviants to support sale of videos edwards said
we had a problem with edwards saying that broun supports the sale of the videos particularly since broun condemned them
edwards claim is based on broun vote against a resolution to prohibit the sale of crush videos
to say a congressman sides with sexual deviants is a hefty claim
whether those reasons trump pragmatic concerns about how best to crack down on distribution of the videos is another question
