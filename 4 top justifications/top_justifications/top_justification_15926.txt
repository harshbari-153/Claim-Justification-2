"The F-35 bombers, scheduled to arrive in Burlington this fall, have been designated with a nuclear mission."
the bombers scheduled to arrive in burlington this fall have been designated with a nuclear mission she wrote
and there s good reason to believe that the bombers in burlington could someday be given a nuclear mission

bombers are coming to burlington true
one of the organizations leading the resistance the peace and justice center has turned its focus in recent months to the possibility the jets in burlington could be equipped with nuclear bombs
