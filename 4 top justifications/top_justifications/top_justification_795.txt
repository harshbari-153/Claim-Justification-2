Members of Congress "receive full pay retirement after serving one term."
email message says members of congress get a full pension for serving just one term
so the email saying that members of congress can receive full pay retirement after serving one term is blatantly bogus
for a member of the house of representatives paid per year that would mean full pay for the rest of their lives after serving as little as two years
it goes on to say many citizens had no idea that members of congress could retire with the same pay after only one term
a congressman or senator who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of for six years of work
