no biden wasn t the only world leader to wear a mask during the virtual climate summit
though biden appears to be the only person wearing a mask in the image that s being shared on social media the photo shows only about a quarter of the world leaders in attendance
biden wore a mask on a video call with world leaders reads the text in a screenshot of one tweet showing a zoom grid of world leaders including president joe biden
and contrary to the suggestion that biden was wearing a mask alone in a room photos from the state department show he was joined at different points by secretary of state antony blinken special presidential envoy for climate john kerry treasury secretary janet yellen national economic council director brian deese and aides
other photos from the summit show both biden not wearing a mask and other officials donning them
