"Every single Petersburg (Va.) school was accredited when I left office."
since he said every petersburg school was accredited when he left office we looked at records from the school year
i m very proud to say by the end of our term with a lot of resources and a lot of help every single petersburg school was accredited when i left office he said
mcauliffe says every single petersburg school was accredited when i left office implying there was a turnaround in the city s scholastic performance during his time as governor
two of petersburg s six schools were fully accredited in while of schools across the state met that ideal
by saying all petersburg schools were accredited and deftly avoiding the distinction between fully and conditionally accredited he creates a misleading impression of the city s progress during his term
