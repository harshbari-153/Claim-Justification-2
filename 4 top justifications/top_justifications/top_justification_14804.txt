watts said the supreme court decided in that children must get a free education
by their illegal immigrant parents and that the supreme court said they must be given a free education
by their illegal immigrant parents must be given a free education
supreme court decision in texas case said public schools must educate children
they were within its jurisdiction as the amendment puts it and so effectively denying the children an education because of their illegal status was unconstitutional
