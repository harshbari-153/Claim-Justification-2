"Sheldon Whitehouse's failure of leadership, the adding of almost $8 trillion in debt in his first full term, is shameful..."
sheldon whitehouse failure of leadership the adding of almost trillion in debt in his first full term is shameful and shows he is unwilling to tackle the problem and go to work on behalf of our children
senate candidate barry hinckley says sheldon whitehouse will have added nearly trillion to the national debt during his first term
to suggest as hinckley statement does that rhode island junior senator is the leader who is destined to saddle the united states with an extra trillion in debt is to put it mildly a stretch
second is the increase a result of whitehouse failure of leadership when we asked the hinckley campaign how whitehouse could be held responsible for the increase he issued a statement through his spokeswoman he made no difference in terms of controlling our debt and has made a huge difference in compliantly increasing it
we ll check two parts of this claim whether the debt will increase by trillion by the time whitehouse completes his first term and the degree to which whitehouse is responsible
