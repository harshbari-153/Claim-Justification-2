Says Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett did not want a juvenile facility in Milwaukee, "has never been to a juvenile facility," and "didn't want it to be done."
taylor said tom barrett did not want a juvenile facility in milwaukee has never been to a juvenile facility and did want it to be done
is taylor right that barrett did not want a juvenile facility in milwaukee has never been to a juvenile facility and did want it to be done at all
the mayor who did want the children here in the first place who has never been to a juvenile facility who did want it to be done should not be the voice at all
has never been to a juvenile facility
in any case barrett was on the record for being in favor of having the youth moved closer though not specifically in milwaukee
