Marco Rubio controlled funds that "out of the $600,000 that were raised, only $4,000 went to candidates to try to improve their chances to be elected to office."
crist said that rubio had set up a slush fund that he used for personal expenses rather than political purposes
in december rubio created floridians for conservative leadership which raised in donations
according to the report rubio spent the biggest chunk of the committee money on political consultants in reimbursements to himself and more than in credit card expenses
but crist here is mixing rubio two political groups with a separate issue rubio had access to a credit card for the republican party of florida and that what he used to pay for the minivan and and hair bills
but he arrives at the number by conflating two separate funds one of which was not permitted to give to candidate campaigns
