Says Obama has never submitted a budget, and Congress has worked for two years without passing one.
you know congress has worked two years without passing a budget
he continued i am embarrassed that two and a half years into his president obama term in office he never submitted a budget
our ruling roemer erred in saying obama had not submitted a budget
obama submitted budgets but it is true that during and when democrats controlled the congress no budget was passed
taken in the context of his remarks roemer s assertion implies that obama and the democrats have been irresponsible and as a result there has been no budget for the last two years
