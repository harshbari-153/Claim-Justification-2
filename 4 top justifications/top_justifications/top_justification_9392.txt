Georgia is one of only five states where breweries canâ€™t sell you a pint of beer to drink on premise or sell you a six-pack to go.
georgia is one of only five states that do not allow beer factories or breweries to sell beer for neither consumption pints nor off premise consumption packaged beer nancy palmer executive director of the georgia craft brewers guild said monday
the group argues craft beer breweries in the state are at a disadvantage because georgia is one of only states where breweries can t sell you a pint of beer to drink or sell you any to go
she said her research showed that only four states besides georgia have laws prohibiting direct sales by breweries to consumers
in west virginia a brewer or resident brewer can not even sample or sell a pint for or consumption said brian arnett with mountain state brewing company
part of the argument for the law change in georgia is the relatively unique restrictions that exist here on beer brewers
