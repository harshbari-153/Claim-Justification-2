Anthony Bourdain and Chris Cornell were killed while working on a documentary about "widespread pedophilia."
no anthony bourdain and other celebrities weren t killed while working on a film about pedophilia
isn t is sic interesting that avicii chester bennington anthony bourdain chris cornell all committed suicide while working on a documentary called the silent children about widespread but the project was cancelled after cornell s death reads the text accompanying photos of the four men
there s no evidence that they were killed much less for their involvement in a movie about pedophilia as this post suggests
a recent facebook post spreading online falls in the latter category suggesting something untoward happened to tim bergling the swedish dj better known as avicii linkin park singer chester bennington chef anthony bourdain and soundgarden singer chris cornell
on social media the suicides of celebrities or public figures are sometimes exploited to advance a nefarious narrative whether that s to claim that the clinton family is murdering political enemies or that people trying to expose a child sex trafficking cabal are being killed
