Says the white man who wanted Rosa Parksâ€™ seat on the bus was suffering from ADHD and anxiety.
a social media post said that the white man who wanted rosa parks seat on the bus was suffering from adhd and anxiety
but a facebook post added an plot twist the rosa parks story gets more complicated when we acknowledge that the white man who wanted her seat was suffering from adhd and anxiety
i have adhd and anxiety one person replied
so the bus filled up and a white man got on and she had his seat and i told her to move back and she wouldn t do it
a social media post about a passenger on rosa parks bus is satire
