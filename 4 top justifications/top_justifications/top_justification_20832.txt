barack obama won this state for the second time and becomes i believe only the second democrat in the last years to win ohio twice with more than percent of the vote
before obama this year the last democrat to win ohio twice in a run for president was bill clinton in and
to make his argument redfern said obama was only the democrat to twice carry ohio with a majority in the last years
that a democrat got a second presidential win in ohio by a majority
while obama s victory in ohio was a big win for democrats republicans had won their share of down ballot races maintaining overwhelming majorities among ohio s congressional delegation at the statehouse as well as on the ohio supreme court
