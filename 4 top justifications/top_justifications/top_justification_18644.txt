"If Trump had just put his father’s money in a mutual fund ... he’d have $8 billion."
if trump had just put his father s money in a mutual fund that tracked the s p and spent his career he d have billion
the national journal has worked out that if trump had just put his father s money in a mutual fund that tracked the s p and spent his career he d have billion
occupy democrats shared an image that said if trump had taken the money he got from his father and simply put it in a fund that tracked the s p he d have billion today
but if you read the national journal story it doesn t directly tie whatever money trump got from his father to an eventual billion today
importantly if the million did not come from trump father then you ca say that the father money could have been worth billion today
