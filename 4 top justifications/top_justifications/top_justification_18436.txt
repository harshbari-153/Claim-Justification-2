The United States is "very energy independent."
trump said the united states is very energy independent
but overall the data cuts against the notion that the united states is very energy independent
it s somewhat premature to label the united states energy independent given that americans consumed more energy than the country produced for most of the last year that we have data
moments later trump declared we are very energy independent
some individual months have seen the united states achieve energy independence in the sense of producing more energy than americans consumed
