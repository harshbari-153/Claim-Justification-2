"When Winston Churchill was asked to cut arts funding in favour of the war effort, he simply replied, ‘then what are we fighting for?’ "
the post says when winston churchill was asked to cut arts funding in favour of the war effort he simply replied then what are we fighting for
no winston churchill didn t say are we fighting for about the arts
a warning to anyone inclined to post a winston churchill quote to social media
we asked david freeman publications director at the international churchill society about the quote
langworth instead points to a different authentic statement churchill made about painting and sculpture the arts are essential to any complete national life
