Says Texas wildfires are linked to climate change.
the texas state climatologist recently wrote that he believes climate change has had an effect in encouraging the current wildfires but only as a modest contributing factor
gulledge found it noteworthy that in a recent blog post john the texas state climatologist and a professor of atmospheric sciences at texas a m university suggested a connection between the wildfires and climate change even if it came with caveats and limitations
but jackson who went to college and taught in texas and continues to visit frequently to see family suggested that the scale of the texas wildfires is starting to change the minds of some scientists who have traditionally been hesitant to blame specific weather events on climate change
however the situation in texas that obama was referring to could be described as something broader than a specific weather event and there is evidence linking broader climate change in the american southwest with the incidence of wildfires in the region
as for the fires obama mentioned texas has been experiencing one of its most severe wildfire seasons in history
