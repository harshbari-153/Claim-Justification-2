Says pre-cut onion used to cook the following day "becomes highly poisonous for even a single night and creates toxic bacteria which may cause adverse stomach infections because of excess bile secretions and even food poisoning."
please remember it is dangerous to cut an onion and try to use it to cook the next day it becomes highly poisonous for even a single night and creates toxic bacteria which may cause adverse stomach infections because of excess bile secretions and even food poisoning
an old myth circulating online warns consumers that an onion to cook the following day is dangerous because it becomes highly poisonous and creates toxic bacteria
we all know the arduous practice of cutting onions makes us cry like babies but is consuming chopped onions actually poisonous
he goes on to explain that because a cut onion s surface dries out quickly it reduces the moisture needed for bacteria to multiply
and to have bacteria multiply there needs to be a source of bacteria on the onion in the first place
