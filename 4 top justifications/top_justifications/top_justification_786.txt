"Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, some of them just to pay the inheritance tax."
ohio is losing over family farms a year some of them just to pay the inheritance tax zehringer said at a nov
the tax has contributed to the declining number of family farms in ohio said state rep
ohio lost family farms in that span for an average of about farms a year
another point of clarity is needed for zehringer s assertion that the state s inheritance tax is causing the state to lose family farms
as for the estate tax s role in the decline it s difficult to say exactly how many family farms were lost for that reason
