"The CDC lowered the PCR threshold while no longer recording asymptomatic cases...but only for the vaccinated."
one such post on twitter which was also shared across facebook questioned why the cdc would deliberately lower the pcr test threshold while no longer recording asymptomatic cases for those who are vaccinated
the post claims that the cdc lowered the benchmark cycle threshold used to determine what s considered a positive covid case which is not true
widely shared social media posts wrongly claim that the centers for disease control and prevention changed its testing parameters for vaccinated individuals so that fewer cases of infections would be recorded
rather the cdc said the move was intended to provide a better means of zeroing in on more complete data on the most concerning cases since not all people with breakthrough infections can be identified particularly those with asymptomatic or mild illness who do not get tested
the agency said it would focus its monitoring of reported vaccine breakthrough cases only on those cases that involved patients who were hospitalized or died
