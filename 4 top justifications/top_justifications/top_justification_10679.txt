The U.S. Supreme Court has not traditionally asked a lot of questions during oral arguments.
the justices say in the century did not ask many questions
we wondered if thomas was accurate when he argued that the supreme court didn t traditionally ask many questions or badger lawyers arguing cases before them
thomas who s been on the bench since and is known for rarely asking questions during oral arguments went on

in the court limited oral arguments to two hours per side
