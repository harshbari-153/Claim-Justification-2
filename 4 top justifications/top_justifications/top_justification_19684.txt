Under Obama's tax plan, "95 percent of you will get a tax cut."
barack obama described his tax plan and said here what i can tell the american people percent of you will get a tax cut
but obama stretched things when he said that percent of you everyone would receive a tax cut
a detailed analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center found that if you look at all tax filers percent of tax filers would see reduced taxes under the obama plan
so obama statement at the debate glosses over a few important details about who would get tax cuts under his plan
we checked a similar claim of obama recently that percent of working families would get lower taxes under obama plan and found it to be true
