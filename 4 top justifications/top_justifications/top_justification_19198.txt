Says a federal judge in San Antonio "issued a ruling that … not only could the students not pray at their graduation, if they used the word ‘benediction,’ the word ‘invocation,’ the word ‘God,’ asked the audience to stand or asked for a moment of silence, he would put the superintendent in jail."
to recap gingrich s claim is that biery issued a ruling that not only could the students not pray at their graduation if they used the word benediction the word invocation the word god asked the audience to stand or asked for a moment of silence he would put the superintendent in jail
however his order prohibited students speaking at the graduation from leading the audience in prayer or delivering a message that would commonly be understood to be a prayer
the judge s ruling did not broadly say students could not pray
the lawsuit alleged that the graduation prayers violated the establishment clause of the first amendment congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion and included a request that the judge issue an emergency order prohibiting the district from including any prayer whether denominated an invocation benediction or otherwise at the graduation on june
the judge s order barred students from asking the audience to stand presumably in preparation for organized prayer but it did not forbid a moment of silence
