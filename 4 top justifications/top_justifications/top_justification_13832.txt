Says Bruce Springsteen "only had 8,000 tickets sold" for a Greensboro show and canceled after "they didnâ€™t get the ticket sales they wanted."
we would be quite surprised if springsteen had sold only half the tickets to his greensboro show just two days before the concert
it s too bad bruce springsteen actually canceled on nearly people at the last minute
the greensboro coliseum previously reported that springsteen s cancellation cost it
andrew brown the arena s pr director told us springsteen had sold more than tickets
what more he used that incorrect number to suggest that was why springsteen canceled
