Says Hillary Clinton "has been saying lately that she thinks that I am, 'not qualified to be president.' "
sanders said clinton has been saying lately that she thinks that i am qualified to be president
so is sanders correct that clinton has been saying the he was not qualified to be president
and she has been saying lately that she thinks that i am qualified to be president he told the crowd
but clinton saying that answers raise questions about his qualifications is very different from saying he not qualified
that headline comes from a story based on an april interview with clinton on the msnbc show morning joe in which host joe scarborough repeatedly tried to get clinton to say whether she believed sanders is qualified and ready to be president
