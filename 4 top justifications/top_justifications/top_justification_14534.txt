"Biden wonâ€™t allow Delta-variant COVID patients to get proven and effective monoclonal treatments even though there are 50,000-100,000 Americans infected by Delta EVERY DAY."
biden won t allow covid patients to get proven and effective monoclonal treatments even though there are americans infected by delta every many of whom will be hospitalized or die without such access gabbard wrote in a jan
gabbard said biden won t allow covid patients to get proven and effective monoclonal treatments even though there are americans infected by delta every day
a spokesperson for gabbard told us that delta patients will not be able to get monoclonal treatment like regeneron because tests don t make the distinction whether a person has the delta or omicron variant
bottom line is biden should stop undermining the health of the american people by interfering with our access to proven therapeutics like monoclonals and stop your cruel joke of telling us we can take the highly effective therapeutic paxlovid when you know it isn t really available
a person with the delta variant has a harder time now finding treatments for the disease but the best data show that the number isn t nearly as high as gabbard said
