None of $400 million the City of Austin proposes to spend on road projects "will be used to add new lanes to congested roadways."
citizens against rail taxes said none of million the city of austin proposes to spend on road projects will be used to add new lanes to congested roadways
group incorrect that city proposition envisions no money for lanes on congested roads
terry mccoy txdot s deputy district engineer for the austin office said the ultimate plan is to build four lanes with a median or lane in the middle but the city money might be enough for only an interim version
specifically city spokeswoman samantha alexander said some of the promised spending would go to projects related to easing access to and from just south of lady bird lake and there also would be projects related to texas plus a single new lane on part of fm in southwest austin among examples
at first we got the impression most of these projects costing around million would simply expand frontage roads or lanes designed to ease traffic more quickly from the highway to city streets
