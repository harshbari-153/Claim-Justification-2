"Oregon, once again, remains among the top five hungriest states in the nation."
oregon is one of the nation s most states but it is among the top five
it continues oregon once again remains among the top five hungriest states in the nation as it was last year
in fact that tendency is so strong that while we were looking into the oregon food bank s assertion that our state is among the top five hungriest in the nation we came upon at least three articles that went one further and called oregon the third hungriest state
as proof he pointed to past reports that have consistently showed oregon near the top
well that would put oregon higher than just other states
