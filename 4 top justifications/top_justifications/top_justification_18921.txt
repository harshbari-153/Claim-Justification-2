Says Mike Gallagherâ€™s plan "would cut Social Security benefits for two-thirds of seniors."
nelson said mike gallagher s plan would cut social security benefits for of seniors
after images of senior citizens appear on the screen the narrator declares mike gallagher s plan would cut social security benefits for of seniors
that s support for biggs approach to social security but it s short of gallagher proposing a plan to change social security that explicitly cuts benefits for of the beneficiaries
but over several decades the maximum social security benefit would be scaled down so that eventually every retiree will receive the same flat dollar benefit from the government
so under biggs proposal social security benefits would decline for the of recipients who have higher incomes though it s important to note the changes would take place over several decades
