NASA study says snake plants can produce enough oxygen for humans to live in a sealed room.
a facebook post claims that according to a nasa study six to eight snake plants could produce enough oxygen to keep humans alive in a room with no airflow
according to nasa clean air study the snake plant is so effective in producing oxygen that if you were locked in a sealed room with no airflow you would be able to survive with just plants in it
in a sealed room would snake plants keep you alive study doesn t say that
but its study didn t draw conclusions about whether plants could produce enough oxygen to keep people alive in a sealed room
but it did not examine whether snake plants would be able to keep humans alive in sealed rooms
