"Barack Obama thinks terrorists just need a good talking to."
barack obama thinks terrorists just need a good talking to
we review past statements from obama to see whether he really believes terrorists just need a good talking to starting with more context from a comment the rnc cites as evidence for its claim
to state the obvious it not fair to extrapolate from that comment the sentiment that terrorists just need a good talking to
and just because obama favors diplomacy with certain nations that sponsor terrorism does not mean he would talk to all terrorists as the claim implies
examples abound of obama pledging to take on terrorists militarily
