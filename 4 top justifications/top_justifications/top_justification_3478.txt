Says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez "says that all young people want to be socialists."
no evidence that aoc said all young people want to be socialists
but there s a lot of distance between those findings and the claim that said all young people want to be socialists
she says that all young people want to be socialists another lie
our searches of google bing and nexis found no instance in which she said that all young people want to be socialists as baxter s ad says
she has described herself as a democratic socialist expressing support for free markets but with more power for workers
