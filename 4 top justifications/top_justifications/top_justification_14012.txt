"Texas man admits kidnapping 79 people."
the image appears to be a screenshot of a news story with this headline texas man admits kidnapping people to anally probe them while disguised as an alien
below a supposed mugshot of this person the story with an el paso dateline continues a man who was arrested by the fbi yesterday has confessed to kidnapping and sexually assaulting several dozen people while using costumes drugs and special effects to have his victims believe they had been abducted by aliens
no a texas man dressed up as an alien didn t kidnap people
there s already enough to fear in the world without counting a prolific kidnapper in an alien costume among your concerns
but an instagram post would have you believe that such a predator was in our midst
