Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is "the largest recipient of lobbyist money."
our ruling americans for prosperity claimed that tester is the largest recipient of lobbyist money in the senate and it provided as backup a chart from a credible independent organization showing tester topping the list
still it s somewhat misleading for the ad to say without further qualification that tester is the largest recipient of lobbyist money among senators
among the examples provided by the ad is that he s the largest recipient of lobbyist money
americans for prosperity says jon tester ranked first in lobbyist donations in the senate
in a crp list of senators who have served since tester barely cracks the top in lobbyist donations
