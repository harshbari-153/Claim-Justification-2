invoking the surveillance activities of the national security agency duffy said the federal consumer financial protection bureau is collecting financial information monitoring financial information of millions of americans without their knowledge and storing it for up to years
so duffy s claim is that the consumer financial protection bureau collects and monitors financial information of millions of americans without their knowledge and stores it for up to years the implication being that bureau is keeping data on individuals personal accounts
we asked duffy s spokeswoman for evidence that the consumer financial protection bureau was monitoring data on individual americans and storing it for up to years
the cfpb is collecting financial information monitoring financial information of millions of americans and they have no clue that it s going on
the law creating the bureau prohibits it from collecting data for purposes of gathering or analyzing the personally identifiable financial information of consumers
