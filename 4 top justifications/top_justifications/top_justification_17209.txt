Responding to a major snow event in Atlanta would be like Kansas City, Mo., responding to a major earthquake.
james said responding to a major snow event in atlanta would be like kansas city responding to a major earthquake
a major snow event in atlanta for them to respond to that is kind of equivalent to us responding to a major earthquake james said
actually major snow events in atlanta occur more frequently than major earthquakes in kansas city he said
secondly just how often does kansas city have a major earthquake and how s that compare with the frequency of crippling snowstorms in atlanta we decided james statement merited further scrutiny
by contrast the city of atlanta has had snowstorms of inches or more over the past years
