Says a majority of Americans -- and Republicans -- support his approach for deficit reduction.
our ruling obama said of a balanced approach to deficit reduction that the majority of the american people agree with me and this approach including by the way a majority of republicans
is that true do most americans including most republicans prefer to raise taxes and cut spending to address the deficit polls supporting the president we searched for public opinion polls to see if they supported the president s declaration
so a plurality supported the republican approach of cutting spending only while a minority supported obama s solution
a majority percent either favored more cuts or the sequester s automatic cuts which buck interpreted as support for republicans approach
showed majority support for curbing the budget deficit through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on companies and high earners as the white house has proposed rather than focusing exclusively on spending reductions as republicans assert according to bloomberg s article
