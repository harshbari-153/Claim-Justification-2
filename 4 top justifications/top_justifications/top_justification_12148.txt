Dan McCready "did admitÂ he opposes middle class tax cuts."
but mccready did admit he opposes middle class tax cuts the narrator says

thus the spokesman posited mccready opposed tax cuts for the middle class
the congressional leadership fund ad says mccready admitted he opposes middle class tax cuts
in fact mccready says in the story he opposes the tax plan because it didn t do enough to help the middle class
