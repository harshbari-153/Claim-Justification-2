Says the paperback edition of Mitt Romney's book deleted line that Massachusetts' individual mandate "should be the model for the country"
but i read your first book and it said in there that your mandate in massachusetts which should be the model for the country and i know it came out of the reprint of the book but you know i just saying you were for individual mandates my friend
the subject of disagreement was territory the texas governor declared that romney book no apology called his massachusetts health care law the model for the country including its individual mandate that people buy health insurance
romney did support massachusetts individual mandate
romney not really saying the massachusetts law should be the model for the country the way that perry describes it
it looks suspicious right perhaps romney did extol every piece of his massachusetts plan individual mandate and all for every state in the union
