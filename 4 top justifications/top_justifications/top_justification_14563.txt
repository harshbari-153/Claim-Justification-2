Says Barack Obama found out about Russia "in August. Now, the election was in November. That's a lot of time. He did nothing about it."
trump said that obama found out about russia in august
now the thing i have to mention is that barack obama when he was president found out about this in terms of if it were russia found out about it in august trump said during a july press conference in poland
donald trump says barack obama nothing about russia prior to election day
the obama administration did not sit idle while russia interfered in the election as trump makes it seem
in hindsight knowing how the russia storyline has played out over the past few months it might have been better to call out russia for hacking a bit sooner but at the time i think the obama administration tried to be responsible she said
