Health reform will "give every American the same opportunity" to buy health insurance the way members of Congress do.
it how everyone in this congress gets affordable insurance
president barack obama extolled the virtues of a national health insurance exchange in a speech to a joint session of congress
we will do this by creating a new insurance exchange a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices
but saying every american will get the same opportunity that congress has to purchase insurance is not correct
insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers
