"For each $1 billion in infrastructure investment, 42,000 jobs are created."
for each billion in infrastructure investment jobs are created
steve latourette says billion in infrastructure investment translates to jobs
billion in spending otherwise that billion gets you jobs
then there s the government accountability office or gao which said in a report on the nation s infrastructure for example the american association of state highway and transportation officials estimates jobs are created for every billion dollars invested in transportation projects
had latourette been referring to infrastructure in general and not specifically transportation infrastructure he might have cited work from the university of massachusetts where economists said that billion in general infrastructure spending creates jobs
