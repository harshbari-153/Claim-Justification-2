Says video shows Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old charged with killing two protesters in Kenosha, "was trying to get away from them" ... "fell, and then they violently attacked him."
trump said a video shows rittenhouse was trying to get away from protesters and fell and then they violently attacked him
he also claimed protesters violently attacked rittenhouse but that is not fully supported by the videos either
rittenhouse did fall as a crowd followed him but trump s comments leave an incendiary and false picture by the time he fell according to criminal charges rittenhouse had already shot and killed one person that night
witnesses say those who were chasing rittenhouse were trying to stop him
rittenhouse began running slowly down the street as a crowd began to follow him with some people shouting get him and shouting he just shot someone
