Quotes Ronald Reagan as saying, "Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempts to disarm the people must be stopped, by force if necessary."
for example facebook users started sharing an image that attributes this quote to former president ronald reagan under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered any attempts to disarm the people must be stopped by force if necessary
searching online we also couldn t find a credible source attributing it to reagan though in he told the nra he would never disarm any american who seeks to protect his or her family from fear and harm according to newsweek
no evidence ronald reagan said this about gun control
according to the collected works of karl marx he said it during an address to the communist league in london
but several sources like the collegian walla walla university s student newspaper in washington state cited german philosopher karl marx as the author of the facebook post quote
