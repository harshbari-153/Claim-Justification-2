"The labor participation rate is at an all-time low."
graham said the labor participation rate is at an low
but is today s labor participation rate at an low not so
while low unemployment rate is generally a good thing economists also say you want a high labor participation rate
i think that we do have stagnant wage growth and i think the labor participation rate is at an low graham said
that said it not necessarily an comparison and the labor participation is at about its lowest level in years
