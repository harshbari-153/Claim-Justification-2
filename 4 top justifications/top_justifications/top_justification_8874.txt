Says if you take the oath of office on the Koran, "then you have committed treason."
let me say about the quran if you take the oath of office on a book recognizing sharia law swearing to defend honor and uphold the united states constitution then you have committed treason reads the text accompanying a photo of omar during her
who also used a koran during her ceremony broke the law by doing so
keith ellison used former president thomas jefferson s copy of the koran for his ceremony drawing complaints from conservative christians who claimed only a bible could be used for the oath of office
ilhan omar didn t break the law when she used a quran to take the oath of office
ceremonial follow during which members can take the oath with their hand on a religious text and be photographed with the speaker
