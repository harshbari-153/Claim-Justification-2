the wisconsin democratic party said a bill backed by duffy and other house republicans could actually require the internal revenue service to conduct audits of rape victims who get an abortion
could gop bill targeting abortion require irs rape audits
extreme republicans in congress like sean duffy are doubling down on their war on women with a completely terrifying proposal that not only makes it harder for women even those using private insurance to access safe legal abortions it could actually require the internal revenue service to conduct audits of rape victims
if the proposal became law could the irs really be required to audit rape victims
they say the bill could put women in the position of having to prove to the irs that their medical expense deduction for an abortion was legal because their pregnancy was caused by rape
