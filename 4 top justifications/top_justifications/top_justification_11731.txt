ben carson said there is not one of the muslim nations that does have discrimination against women discrimination against gays subjugation of other religious beliefs
convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women while the united states did not
we had a little more trouble pinning down which if any muslim countries have little institutional discrimination against the lgbt community
while there are many nations that do have a record of institutional discrimination against women members of the lgbt community and religious groups there are plenty of exceptions
although it isn t ranked on the overall index list the united states is listed as low or very low discrimination in all categories except civil liberties for which it is labeled medium discrimination for reasons such as low numbers of female elected leaders and no national paid maternity or paternity leave
