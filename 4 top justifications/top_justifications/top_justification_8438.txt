Democrats have said that "even one hearing (on the stimulus bill) would be one too many, and that we have a single day to approve these five complex propositions that will affect the lives of millions."
we ve been told that even one hearing would be one too many and that we have a single day to approve these five complex propositions that will affect the lives of millions
that s because the speaker wants the entire stimulus package on the house floor next week
while i understand the majority s desire to move quickly on the stimulus package i think the short leash that the speaker has put us on restricts our ability to write competent legislation
will this package of legislation waste money will it abuse people will it raise a dust cloud of unintended and unhappy consequences will we be embarrassed by some of what we approve here today the answer is yes yes yes and yes
one can argue whether the urgency of the economic crisis outweighs the need for deliberate consideration through congressional hearings but barton is right there have been no hearings on the massive stimulus package that congress is expected to vote on as early as this week
