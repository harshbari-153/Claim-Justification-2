the question here is whether geithner failure to pay taxes related to his employment at the imf was a common problem
it extremely rare for the irs to garnish an imf employee wages due to failure to pay taxes murray said
it is a strange situation said the tax policy center eric toder who admitted that he has struggled trying to figure out his own tax obligation when he did some consulting work for the imf
it is a mistake that is commonly made for people who are working internationally or for international institutions
by some accounts it can be confusing for imf employees to figure out their tax obligation
