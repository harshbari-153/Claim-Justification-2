"The same 3 senators who have spent the last 3 years s------- themselves over ‘Benghazi!’ just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent."
a meme from the other said the same senators who have spent the last years s themselves over benghazi just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by percent
so saying that the senators introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by percent is misleading
the image includes pictures of three republican senators ted cruz of texas dean heller of nevada and marco rubio of florida along with the caption the same senators who have spent the last years s themselves over benghazi just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by percent
meanwhile the meme s argument that the senators are hypocrites for wanting to cut embassy security by percent is exaggerated
news release announcing the bill the three senators didn t even mention the threat of a security cut while repeatedly highlighting their goal of moving the embassy
