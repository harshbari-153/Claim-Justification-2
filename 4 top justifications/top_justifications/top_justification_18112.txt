"Dr. Paul never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution."
paul never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the constitution
we checked with a congressional historian and two constitutional law professors who said they believe those votes do not meet paul claim
an examination of paul record shows that although he usually adheres to his principle he has sometimes voted for programs that are expressly authorized in the constitution
but never is a tough standard to meet and years in congress covers an awful lot of votes
he quibbled over whether the measures technically could be considered legislation
