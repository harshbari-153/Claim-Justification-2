In the House Republican health care bill, "we’re expanding women’s access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics."
loudermilk said that in the house republican health care bill we re expanding women s access to health services by redirecting planned parenthood dollars to community health centers which vastly outnumber planned parenthood clinics
in fact we re expanding women s access to health services by redirecting planned parenthood dollars to community health centers which vastly outnumber planned parenthood clinics
would gop bill expand women health care by curbing planned parenthood
could pushing planned parenthood out of the picture really expand women s access to health care we found that there are indeed more community health centers than planned parenthood clinics but that doesn t mean that redirecting dollars to them will amount to expanding women s access to health services
would redirecting funding to these centers expand women s access to health services
