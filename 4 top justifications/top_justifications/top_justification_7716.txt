If masks prevent coronavirus, governors would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them.
a facebook post claimed that if masks prevent coronavirus governors in new york michigan and california would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them
states do use masks to contain in prisons
if the masks actually work to prevent the post continues then why didn t we just hand them out to all inmates instead of releasing them to prevent the spread
new york michigan and california prisons are providing masks to inmates as well as staff as part of their response
but if masks really work a facebook post asks rhetorically why aren t governors using them more in jails and prisons that have become hotspots
