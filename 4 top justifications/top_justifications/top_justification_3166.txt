President Barack Obama is "ending Medicare as we know it."
mitt romney says barack obama is ending medicare as we know it
romney s charge that obama would end medicare as we know it is at least as overheated as the democratic charge that the ryan plan would end medicare
the romney campaign used it in a news release that listed five questions each beginning with why is president obama ending medicare as we know it
so that does support the sweeping claim that obama is changing medicare as we know it
first how accurate are his five claims and second do they collectively indicate that obama is ending medicare as we know it the claim that obama is funding his health care law by billion in medicare cuts has the most merit but three of the other claims greatly exaggerate a nugget of truth
