There were no American flags at the first Democratic presidential debate.
not a single american flag at the democrat debate reads the text next to a photo of the presidential candidates who participated in the first of two nights of debates hosted by nbc
searching through pages of getty images photos from the first debate we saw none with a physical american flag made of cloth
there are no physical flags in the pictures
the democratic debate stage was decorated with stars stripes and lots of red white and blue
but searching for photos of the republican presidential debates it appears similar sets were used lots of stars stripes and an american color palette
