"I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole â€¦ to a $2 billion surplus."
kasich said i took the state of ohio from an billion hole to a billion surplus
john kasich i took the state of ohio from an billion hole to a billion surplus
repeating a claim he has often made including on his campaign website kasich said i took the state of ohio from an billion hole to a billion surplus
a billion surplus
still it s worth noting that kasich spoke a little grandly when he said that i did it since the state s fiscal improvement got a big assist from the national economic recovery
