Says Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt "tried to cut a deal with big pharma" in a lawsuit.
an ad from the afscme union said laxalt tried to cut a deal with drug makers
laxalt tried to cut a deal with big pharma instead of standing up for us and drug prices continue to rise the ad said
that leaves whether laxalt tried to cut a deal with big pharma as the key claim to check
interestingly laxalt s campaign staff pointed to the same words in the same document to show that he didn t cut a deal with the drug company representatives
at a cost of over half a million dollars the ad from the union of government workers skewered republican gubernatorial candidate adam laxalt for cozying up to drug companies
