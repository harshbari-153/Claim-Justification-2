Rep. Carol Shea-Porter "votes with Nancy Pelosiâ€™s Democrats 95 percent of the time," but Frank Guinta "will take on both parties" and has "independent New Hampshire values."
the nrcc ad says that votes with nancy pelosi s democrats percent of the time but guinta will take on both parties and has independent new hampshire values
independent new hampshire values that s frank guinta
nrcc ad says carol is a partisan democrat frank guinta is independent
second he said that s votes that make up that percent are out of touch with her district and show that she puts her own liberal agenda ahead of her district
that s a pretty stark comparison yet by the most measurement of how both candidates have voted in congress guinta scored a percent partisan unity with republicans during his term in congress which is hardly evidence of a big contrast
