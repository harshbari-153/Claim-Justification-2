The IAEA, or the International Atomic Energy Agency, "last month said the Iranians are not currently living up to their obligations."
cheney said the iaea last month said the iranians are not currently living up to their obligations
the iaea last month said the iranians are not currently living up to their obligations said cheney daughter of former vice president dick cheney referring to the question of verification
because iran has in some cases stonewalled the iaea preventing them from verifying whether iran s past and present nuclear programs are entirely peaceful the agency has felt for years that iran has not lived up to its obligations albright said
in addition iran has simply never accepted some of the united nations resolutions that required them to suspend uranium enrichment and other activities meaning they haven t lived up to some of their other obligations said matthew bunn professor and nuclear weapons expert at harvard university
the iaea found in sum that it could not affirm that iran was fully complying with the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons treaty because iran did not provide enough information for the agency to clarify outstanding questions
