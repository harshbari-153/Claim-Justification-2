Says Joe Biden plans to "mandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing."
trump said that biden plans to mandate carbon emissions for homes offices and all new buildings by
biden has a emissions goal for new buildings by but his plan doesn t mention a mandate
trump said biden wants to mandate emission buildings and get rid of windows he s wrong
neither the task force recommendation nor biden s new climate plan say anything about getting rid of windows and emissions buildings can have windows and many do
climate policy and analysis at the environmental defense fund said that trump s claim that biden and sanders want to get rid of windows is preposterous
