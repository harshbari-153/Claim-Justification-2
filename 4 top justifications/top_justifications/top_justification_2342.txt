Some "20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions" as a result of "political favoritism and backroom deals."
did delphi salaried employees lose part of their pensions some as much as percent the short and general answer is yes
part of turner s rebuttal was this in the process of the billion auto rescue delphi salaried retirees lost up to percent of their pensions
meantime we return to turner s claim in the process delphi salaried retirees lost up to percent of their pensions
if delphi faltered and the union pensions got cut gm would top up or supplement those smaller pensions so delphi retirees could have the retirements they d always expected
salaried workers who spent their careers at delphi got no such deal and they have seen their pensions cut
