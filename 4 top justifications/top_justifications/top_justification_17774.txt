"While Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work."
what does all this say about the claim in brown tv ad that while mandel been busy traveling the country raising campaign money he has shown up for work the claim in the brown ad is partially accurate
sherrod brown ad claims josh mandel raised campaign cash instead of showing up for work
but the implication of the claim in the brown campaign ad is that mandel has neglected his duties as state treasurer while he campaigns for senate
his campaign cited meetings of the board of deposit on which mandel sits including at least one case where mandel was fundraising in washington on the day of a meeting
democrats have pointed to mandel calendar before as an article in the plain dealer reported last january to argue he was barely working or that he was not being forthcoming in how he spends his time
