"The ACLU has filed a suit to have all military cross-shaped headstones removed."
did you know that the aclu has filed a suit to have all military headstones removed and another suit to end prayer from the military completely they making great progress
there a lot packed into that but here we checking whether the american civil liberties union has filed suit to have all military headstones removed
we asked the aclu if they had filed such a suit
no aclu lawsuit over headstones
for good measure he added the aclu has also not filed suit to stop voluntary prayer in the military either
