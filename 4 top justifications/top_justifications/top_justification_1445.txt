Says U.S. Rep. Martin Heinrich "spent a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas."
martin heinrich told new mexico he would fight unemployment but he spent a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas
did a new mexico spend trillion in tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas
it s correct that heinrich voted for the stimulus bill known as the american recovery and reinvestment act
but did that bill spend a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas we tried to reach the american future fund but the group did not return our inquiries
by our count the overwhelming majority of the stimulus could have possibly been spent on failed companies here and jobs overseas
