"The Senate voted this week to allow illegal aliens access to Social Security benefits."
the senate voted this week to allow illegal aliens access to social security benefits
claims the senate voted to give undocumented workers social security benefits
then the claim was used against senators who voted against an amendment to the comprehensive immigration act that would have blocked social security benefits to legal immigrants who paid taxes before they obtained the right to work
if the government gives benefits to illegal aliens who have never contributed where does that leave those of us who have paid into social security all our working lives please sign this petition and flood president obama box with that tell him that even if the house passes this bill he needs to veto it
we been getting this for six months and every time it exclaims that the senate voted this week on such a bill
