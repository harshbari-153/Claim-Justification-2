Says most Texas schools spend 45 out of 180 school days in mandated testing.
ted lyon says most texas schools spend days on mandated tests
a statesman reader asked us does texas spend a quarter of its school days on such tests we were curious too especially as we had recently rated mostly false a claim that austin s school district lists days a year for state testing
but our sense is that texas school districts might be giving tests on days a school year while benchmark tests can absorb about four to nine days though admittedly that s based only on what we gleaned from the austin and mesquite districts for
most schools spend days out of the days in a school year in some form of mandated testing
our ruling there seems to be scant information spelling out precisely how many days most schools give mandated tests
