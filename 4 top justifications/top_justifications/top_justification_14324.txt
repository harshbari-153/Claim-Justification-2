Says Joe Radinovich "was cited 30 times for not paying court fines."
but radinovich was cited times for not paying court fines
the congressional leadership fund said radinovich was cited times for not paying court fines
the pac said radinovch was cited times for not paying court fines but a citation can mean in the legal sense a ticket or a charge
radinovich unquestionably did not pay a number of his traffic and parking fines when due
that did not mean radinovich faced new misdemeanor charges strictly for failure to pay rather the pac told politifact that it used the word cited as a reference to court notations of radinovich s failure to pay on time and these notations were not just in the cases sent for collection
