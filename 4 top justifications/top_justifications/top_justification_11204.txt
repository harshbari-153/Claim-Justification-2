Barack Obama and the Democrats have "proposed a tax for not having health insurance."
here we checking the claim that they even proposed a tax for not having health insurance
we studied the health reform proposals being considered in congress right now and the main democratic versions propose a tax penalty on people who do carry health insurance
the tax is the mechanism that democrats want to use to prod people to get health coverage
but all of the democratic plans include the mandate which is a tax penalty on those who do have insurance
barack obama and democrats promise that health care reform will lower costs but their plans deliver increased taxes the ad says
