"President Obama came to Ohio 12 times to try to defeat me and guess what? He didn't win."
i mean president obama came to ohio times to try to defeat me and guess what he did win
lately kasich has recycled one of the more questionable assertions within that statement namely that president barack obama visited ohio a dozen times to campaign against him
gov john kasich says barack obama came to ohio times to campaign against him
but a review of obama s travel schedule and the text of all the speeches he made here show that only a small part of his time in ohio was devoted to campaigning against kasich
obama did make visits to ohio as president before election day last november
