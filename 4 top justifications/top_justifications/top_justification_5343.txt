"While many of his colleagues turned down a $2,500 pay raise ... (Jeff) Plale pocketed the extra money."
it includes this claim last year while many of his colleagues turned down a pay raise because wisconsin faced a deficit and our families faced tough economic times senator plale pocketed the extra money
wisconsin state jeff plale pocketed a a year raise when others turned it down
so what about the original claim that plale pocketed the money plale s salary did go up there was no way to stop that
so did plale take the money and run members of the state assembly and senate are paid
over the full period that would amount to or percent of the full raise
