Says President Obama was wrong "about Muslims' historical contributions to mankind, such as algebra (actually that was the ancient Babylonians), the compass (that was the Chinese), pens (the Chinese again) and medical discoveries."
obama listed incorrectly muslims historical contributions to mankind such as algebra actually that was the ancient babylonians the compass that was the chinese pens the chinese again and medical discoveries huh she wrote in a june on the human events web site
we find coulter is incorrect about obama statement about algebra that she largely right about navigation that she wrong about pens and that it fuzzy about how much muslims contributed to modern medicine
obama overstates the role muslims played in printing
lastly obama contends that muslims developed certain aspects of modern medicine which is partly true
so obama claim that the mastery of pens originated in the muslim world is in the ballpark
