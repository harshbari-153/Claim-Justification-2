Says a CNN anchor said that Hillary Clinton has gotten "a free ride so far from the media. We're the biggest ones supporting her campaign."
friend a cnn anchor acknowledged that the media has given hillary clinton a free ride the email said
the free ride for clinton seems to refer to the earned literally free media coverage that clinton was enjoying at the time much as trump eventually would
and by free ride cuomo isn t saying that the media has been unquestioning toward clinton
given this backdrop the most plausible interpretation is that cuomo was noting clinton s reliance on free media from outlets like cnn at a time when she would not have been able to run campaign ads or other efforts
she got a free ride so far from the media
