"There is no legal basis" for Donald Trump's "missile strike against Syrian military assets."
pocan said there is no legal basis for trump missile strike against syrian military assets
there is no legal basis for last night s missile strike against syrian military assets the democrat declared in a statement on april
mark pocan wrongly claims donald trump had no legal authority to launch missile attack on syria
but pocan went too far in saying there is no legal basis for trump s action
bush argued in that democratic president barack obama didn t have unilateral authority to launch attacks against syria as was being considered at the time
