"It was (Rob Portman’s) job to stop China’s illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing."
it was his job to stop china s illegal dumping of steel the narrator says
was it really his job to stop china s illegal steel dumping and did portman really do nothing to stand up for the united states
so was it portman s job to stop china illegal dumping of steel
strickland s ad says that it was portman s job to stop china s illegal dumping of steel
but to a trade expert s ear it makes no sense to say that portman failed to stop illegal chinese dumping
