"Every year the First Coast Guard District saves 350 lives in the Northeast."
but the news release did conclude with this every year the first coast guard district saves lives in the northeast
and of course this summer a news release concerning the fishing boat that sank miles out at sea concluded every year the first coast guard district saves lives in the northeast
in it sent out a release saying in an average year the coast guard assists lives and saves lives across the northeast
in a news release a officer declared that the coast guard saves more than lives in the northeast per year
which brings us to a second question what does the coast guard mean by a life saved
