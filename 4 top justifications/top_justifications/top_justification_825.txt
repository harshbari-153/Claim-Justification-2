Says Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg "put an 80-year-old farmer in jail for refusing to plant native vegetation on his farm."
citizens for a strong america claimed in a tv ad that kloppenburg put an farmer in jail for refusing to plant native vegetation on his farm
ad says joanne kloppenburg jailed an farmer for refusing to plant native vegetation on his farm
among them is a group called citizens for a strong america which claims in a tv ad kloppenburg is so extreme she even put an farmer in jail for refusing to plant native vegetation on his farm
in any case that s not the same as kloppenburg putting hensler in jail for not planting native vegetation a claim that is all the more ridiculous when you consider what happened over the course of hensler s dispute with the government
wayne hensler did refuse to plant native vegetation and he was when he went to jail
