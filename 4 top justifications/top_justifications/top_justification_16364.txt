Coca-Cola made cans that say "Try to be less white."
no didn t make try to be less white cans
now people are sharing an image of a can that says try to be less white
com and try to be less white doesn t appear on the can
we couldn t find the original image of this can with or without try to be less white appearing on it but in february snopes looked into a different picture of a can that also said try to be less white
the mock can appearing in some social media feeds was not created distributed or authorized by the company the company said in a statement sent to politifact
