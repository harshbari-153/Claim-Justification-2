at the request of democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall trump said jan
trump said at the request of democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall
the democrats are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a concrete wall but we are not building a concrete wall we are building artistically designed steel slats so that you can easily see through it
do we disagree on a wall or do you really agree that maybe a steel fence qualifies as a fence and not a wall and we want to build a steel barrier anyway mulvaney said
democrats have been pushing for other forms to secure the border including the reinforcement of existing physical barriers but have made no concessions on trump s border wall proposals
