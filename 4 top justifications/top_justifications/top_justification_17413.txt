Says NC absentee voters have "no way" to know if ballots are delivered
the nc elections board enables voters to track the status of their absentee ballots online
is it true that absentee voters have no way of knowing whether their ballots were delivered mcconnell s speech did refer to any state specifically
by clicking on it voters can see when an absentee ballot was sent what address it was sent to and whether a voted ballot was received by the county board
and once those operatives take a hold of those ballots the voters have no way to keep tabs on whether they were ever delivered he said in the feb
mcconnell wrong about tracking absentee ballots in nc
