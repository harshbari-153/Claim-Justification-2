Says "kids who start in the ninth grade in the city of Newark this past September, 23 percent of them will graduate in four years."
our ruling christie said that the kids who start in the ninth grade in the city of newark this past september percent of them will graduate in four years
but my biggest disappointment is when you know that the kids who start in the ninth grade in the city of newark this past september percent of them will graduate in four years percent
actually more than half of newark s ninth grade students will graduate from high school in four years because there s more than one way recognized by the state department of education to earn a high school diploma
about percent of newark freshmen graduate in four years not percent
he said there how hard is it to understand failure when in newark the children this year two months ago who entered the ninth grade percent will graduate in four years with a high school diploma
