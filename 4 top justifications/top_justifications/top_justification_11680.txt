Says Sen. John McCain spent the July 4 weekend in Islamabad, Pakistan, selling "F-16s and advanced weapons to the folks who harbored Osama bin Laden."
ward said mccain was in pakistan during the fourth of july weekend selling and advanced weapons to the folks who harbored osama bin laden
rival claims john mccain visited pakistan to sell weapons to who harbored osama bin laden
mccain did go to pakistan that holiday weekend as well as afghanistan for his annual visit to american troops on independence day
as for the accusation that mccain was engineering a sale to people who harbored bin laden that is also unproven
the ward campaign also referenced a june meeting between mccain and former pakistan president asif ali zardari in los angeles
