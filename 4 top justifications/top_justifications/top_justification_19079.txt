The National Science Foundation awarded $700,000 to fund a climate change musical.
smith said the science foundation awarded for a climate change musical
climate change musical funded by national science foundation grant
the nsf awarded nearly that much for a theater company to produce a musical play that focuses on climate change and biodiversity conservation
smith chairman of the house science space technology committee listed six national science foundation grants as questionable including smith said at the panel s march hearing a climate change musical that was prepared for broadway but i m not sure ever was actually produced
finally we circled back to the foundation to ask if the musical was an unusual grant beneficiary
