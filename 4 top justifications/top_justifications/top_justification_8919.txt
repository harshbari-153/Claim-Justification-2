Republicans "made it easier to buy a gun" in states they won in 2010.
shields said that when republicans took control of state legislatures in they made it easier to buy a gun
they made it easier to buy a gun and tougher to vote
out of states won by the gop three passed laws that relaxed the rules for some gun buyers
but we found no evidence that republicans across the country made sweeping changes to make it easier to purchase a firearm
found that states with full republican controll accounted for nearly three quarters of the changes that enhanced gun rights mainly easing the rules for carrying weapons
