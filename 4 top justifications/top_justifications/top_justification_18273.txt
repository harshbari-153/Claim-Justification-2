If you get a flu shot, you're "poisoning yourself."
in short the claim that you are poisoning yourself when you get the flu vaccine is false
bloggers poison truth in claim about flu shot dangers
in a facebook post nicole lecrone estep who claims to have worked in healthcare for years offers a photograph of a sign about flu shots that asks people to research side effects ingredients before poisoning yourself the word poisoning is in bright red letters
the post states that the flu shot includes ingredients such as mercury antifreeze phenol animal blood animal viruses and formaldehyde
medical experts say the evidence is overwhelming that flu shots are safe and effective although they routinely acknowledge that the shots are far from completely protective
