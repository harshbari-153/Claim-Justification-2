"Schools are trying to make a law that teachers can see girls' private parts to make sure they're not trans."
schools are trying to make a law that teachers can see girls private parts to make sure they not trans
several tiktok posts say schools are trying to make a law that teachers can see girls private parts to make sure they not trans
that claim is a misunderstanding of how some states are trying to legislate against transgender students
in response several state legislatures introduced bills that would prohibit transgender students from being part of teams that don t match their sex assigned at birth
while some proposals including legislation in iowa and georgia contain specific provisions about doctors exams we could find no evidence that lawmakers are pushing for teachers to examine transgender students
