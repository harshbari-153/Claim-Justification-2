"During my administration, funding for education has increased by over $930 million."
however during my administration funding for education has increased by over million
has funding for education increased by million since deal took office
deal has proposed increasing education spending by million
we still wondered whether it was accurate for the governor to say education spending had risen by million if this budget hasn t been adopted
about million of that would merely fund growth in student enrollment
