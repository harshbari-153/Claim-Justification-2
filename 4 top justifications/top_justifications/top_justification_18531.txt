Ed Gillespie "would not mention (Donald Trumpâ€™s) name unless he was condemning him."
stewart said gillespie would not mention trump s name unless he was condemning him
he would not mention his name unless he was condemning him
at the latter event fredericks said he introduced gillespie who never mentioned trump in his speech
so we ll fact check the second part of stewart s statement that gillespie only mentioned trump s name when he was condemning him
but fredericks also acknowledged that he never asked gillespie to appear with trump and therefore can t say definitively if gillespie would not do so
