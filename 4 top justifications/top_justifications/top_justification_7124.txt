The stimulus includes "$7 million to build a bridge in Thedford, Nebraska, to help 168 residents avoid a 30-second wait at a local train crossing. Not one full-time job will be created."
in this item we examine the claim that the stimulus includes million to build a bridge in thedford nebraska to help residents avoid a wait at a local train crossing
boehner says stimulus includes million for bridge over railway to town of
and while some locals say the wait for a train passing is sometimes as short as seconds or as long as minutes nebraska department of roads officials cited safety not convenience concerns as the impetus for the project though no accidents have been reported at the crossing
it true that million in stimulus funds was awarded to build a viaduct allowing traffic to pass over bnsf railway tracks on u
so boehner has the project and the pricetag correct but we think it misleading to claim the bridge only leads to a town of when it is crossed more than times a day
