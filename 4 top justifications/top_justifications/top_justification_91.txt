It's "not true" that since he's been the president, executions in Iran have increased by four times.
again the iranian government does not publicly release statistics on executions but we think the human rights reports provide convincing evidence that executions in iran have risen dramatically during ahmadinejad presidency
in an interview on abc this week host christiane amanpour asked iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad if he was aware that since you been the president executions in iran have increased by four times
in addition the report states a sharp increase in the rate of executions was registered in the period between the presidential election on june and the inauguration of mahmoud ahmadinejad for a second term as president on august
the united nations does not track the exact number of executions in iran but an october report notes that the u
and so we rule that ahmadinejad denial of an increase in executions during his presidency is false
