"Doug Collins repeatedly joined liberal Stacey Abrams to raise taxes...Kelly’s never voted for a tax increase — and never will."
the second part of the claim kelly s never voted for a tax increase and never will is also misleading
the ad then goes on to refer to hr as the largest tax increase in georgia history and concludes by saying that kelly s never voted for a tax increase and never will
the first part of the claim doug collins repeatedly joined liberal stacey abrams to raise taxes does not strictly apply to the bill that the ad calls the greatest tax increase in georgia history
the ad s claim that collins joined liberal stacey abrams to raise taxes is therefore misleading
doug collins repeatedly joined liberal stacey abrams to raise taxes the ad claims with text citing hr a bill to fund infrastructure projects
