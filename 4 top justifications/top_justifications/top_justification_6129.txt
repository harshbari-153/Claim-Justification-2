Says a Senate resolution would restore $140 in monthly general assistance payments and prevent people from committing crime.
cunningham told politifact new jersey that at the time she made the statement she believed the senate resolution would restore the cut to monthly payments
cunningham one of the sponsors of a resolution for that funding strongly implied that the state budget for fiscal year cut the monthly payments and that her resolution would restore that amount
cunningham acknowledged the monthly benefits were restored but it is still ridiculous for her to claim people will commit crime in response to losing general assistance payments when those payments aren t changing at all
in fact the final state budget maintains general assistance payments at their previous levels
but what about cunningham s claim that losing general assistance payments could drive some recipients to commit crimes two experts said general assistance payments won t necessarily prevent crime
