i asked the unions to pay into their own health care insurance just as their wisconsin neighbors do and they said i was being unreasonable walker s letter said
i requested that they contribute toward their own pensions just as their wisconsin neighbors do and they screamed it was unfair
our ruling in a fundraising letter walker stated unions had rejected his push to pay more for pensions and health care
the unions reacted by going public with statements offering to give walker what he wanted on pensions and health if he would back off the collective bargaining limits
it s clear that the biggest state employees union reacted negatively from the start to walker s push for concessions on health insurance and pensions
