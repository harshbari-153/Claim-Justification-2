our ruling at a news conference christie claimed ronald reagan was behind in the polls in going into the debate with jimmy carter and then turned around days later and won states
ask ronald reagan if he were around you know who was behind in the polls in going into the debate with jimmy carter and then turned around days later and won states christie a republican said at a sept
reagan was behind in some polls and ahead of carter in others
it s true that reagan won states in the election but it s not entirely accurate for christie to say reagan was behind in the polls going into the debate with carter
just like the debate took ronald reagan from trailing in the polls to winning states on election day the governor said
