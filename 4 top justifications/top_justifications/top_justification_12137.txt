The Baucus health care bill would require taxes on medical devices such as X-ray machines, female condoms, HIV tests and surgical needles.
initially the finance panel was planning to subject all medical devices to the tax
we found that the following items would still be subject to the current version of the proposed tax either because they rated class iii or because they considered class ii and cost more than powered breast pumps tests for hiv pacemakers ventilators machines powered wheelchairs hip knee ankle and breast prosthetics and dentures
we should also add that the tax may not necessarily be included in the final health care bill that will be crafted from the various versions in different committees
so when the senate finance committee began considering a tax on medical devices including some modest devices such as enema kits and breast pumps it was no surprise that conservatives would use the tax to rally opposition
class iii items the percent that sustain or support life are implanted or present potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury have always been subject to baucus proposed tax
