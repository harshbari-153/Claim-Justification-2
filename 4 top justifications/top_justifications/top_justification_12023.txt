"If you look at the one (hydroxychloroquine) survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old. Almost dead."
if you look at the one survey the only bad survey they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape trump said at a may press event
trump spoke about the one survey a study of va patients and hydroxychloroquine and said it was bad because they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape
to say they were in very bad shape is also off the mark
once that was done they could make comparisons of the effect of hydroxychloroquine on people who got the drug and those who didn t
trump wrong that hydroxychloroquine studies only gave drug to dying patients
