Says President Barack Obama "will not utter the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ and as matter of policy, nobody in the administration will say the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism.’"
the fact that president obama will not identify he literally will not utter the words radical islamic terrorism and as matter of policy nobody in the administration will say the words radical islamic terrorism
cruz said that obama administration won t use the phrase radical islamic terrorism
said the administration avoids linking the words radical islam and terrorism because it does not want to give the islamic state religious legitimacy in the islamic world and swell the organization s ranks
we also ran the phrase radical islamic terrorism through the search engine on the white house website and couldn t find an instance of administration officials describing the islamic state in that way
so we tried a lexisnexis search of media articles and speech transcripts that used the phrases barack obama and radical islamic terrorism
