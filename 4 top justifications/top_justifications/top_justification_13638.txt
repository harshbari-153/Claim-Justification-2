buttigieg said that americans say that what they want is a choice to join a system like medicare rather than ending private insurance
is buttigieg correct to say that americans prefer giving people under an option to join medicare as opposed to requiring them to give up their current coverage
the survey asked do you think medicare for all that want it that is allow all americans to choose between a national health insurance program or their own private health insurance is a good idea or a bad idea
the survey asked do you favor or oppose having a national health plan sometimes called in which all americans would get their insurance from a single government plan essentially the warren approach
an news poll conducted in mid july asked do you think medicare for all that is a national health insurance program for all americans that replaces private health insurance is a good idea or a bad idea this is essentially the warren approach
