Says Nancy Pelosi "wonâ€™t let Capitol police testify about what happened Jan. 6."
pelosi won t let capitol police testify about what happened on jan
no nancy pelosi isn t blocking capitol police officers from testifying about
but it s not accurate that pelosi is blocking police from testifying
but a few days later a claim started circulating on social media that house speaker nancy pelosi was preventing officers from telling lawmakers about what happened that day
thompson didn t specify which officers the committee would call to appear according to the hill but said many of us hope to begin the process with a hearing in which the capitol police officers themselves could be able to testify about their experiences
