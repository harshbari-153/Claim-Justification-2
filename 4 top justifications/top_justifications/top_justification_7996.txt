"[L]ess than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs are covered" in a referendum to levy a 1-cent sales tax.
let keep in mind that less than of atlanta transportation needs are covered in this referendum bodker told the atlanta in a recent news story
this legislation created special regional transportation tax districts across the state including one in metro atlanta
if voters back the tax in a referendum it gets levied and construction begins
we asked bodker how he determined that the upcoming referendum would cover less than of the region s transportation needs
since the effects of a single project can cross city and county boundaries much of the region s transportation planning is handled by the atlanta regional commission
