"Dubai is the only country with huge amounts of imported workers that's actually passed legislation to give these immigrant workers a better deal in the Middle East."
dubai is the only country with huge amounts of imported workers that actually passed legislation to give these immigrant workers a better deal in the middle east clinton said
but the real issue here is clinton claim that uae is the only country with huge amounts of imported workers that actually passed legislation to give these immigrant workers a better deal in the middle east
but again our focus is the claim clinton made about immigrant workers and that the uae is the only middle east country that has passed legislation to improve the lot of a large population of imported workers
clinton says uae only middle east country to pass laws to address plight of immigrant workers
the uae government did pass labor laws designed to help protect immigrant workers
