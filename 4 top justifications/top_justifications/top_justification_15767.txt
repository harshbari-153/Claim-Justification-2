Says President Donald Trump "has given more financial disclosure than anybody else."
mnuchin said trump has given more financial disclosure than anybody else
has trump given more financial disclosure than anybody else
the president has released plenty of information and i think has given more financial disclosure than anybody else
when trump argued that his financial disclosures were the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics we rated that claim false
but as we concluded in the past trump s lack of tax returns undermine any type of claim that he s released more financial information than anybody else
