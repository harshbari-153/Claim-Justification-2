David Dewhurst "has never once cut one penny from the state budget."
ted cruz says david dewhurst has ever cut a penny from state budget
we asked johnson how cruz concluded that dewhurst has never cut a penny from the state budget particularly given that the and legislatures made reductions to accommodate projected revenue shortfalls and the republican majority s desire not to raise taxes
david dewhurst s fiscal record in a televised debate saying i ll tell you something the lieutenant governor will not tell you in his entire tenure in elected office he has never once cut one penny from the state budget
however these results do not mean dewhurst never once cut the budget
also comparing the first and fourth budgets passed into law on dewhurst s watch is not the only way to gauge whether dewhurst ever cut a penny
