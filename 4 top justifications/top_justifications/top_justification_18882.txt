"Congressman McCollum voted to dismantle Social Security."
the state party said that when he was in congress mccollum voted to dismantle social security
democrats say mccollum voted to dismantle social security
mccollum did vote for the tax cuts but it a huge leap of logic to equate that with dismantling social security
and contrary to the democrats overall point we found a few articles that mention votes mccollum took to protect social security
the orlando sentinel quoted mccollum as saying i don t believe in privatizing social security
