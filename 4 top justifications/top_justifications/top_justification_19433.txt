In the House health care bill, "Something like 2 percent of the people would [be] eligible even to get the public option."
in explaining how limited the current house bill version is wyden said something like percent of the people would be eligible even to get the public option
now million people buying the public option amounts to just over percent of the million americans who are under age that is the million americans who are eligible for medicare the universal health insurance program for the elderly
but contrary to what wyden said it not that percent of americans will be eligible for the public option in it that percent will choose the public option that year according to cbo estimate
the house health care bill with its exchanges public option and nearly pages of densely worded text is the easiest thing to comprehend
the actual number of people eligible to choose the public option would be the entire pool of million americans in the exchange almost percent of the population or five times the proportion that wyden indicated
