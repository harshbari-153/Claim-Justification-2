Says under the Democratic impeachment inquiry, Republicans get "more rights than we ever received in any of the other impeachment proceedings."
pelosi said that republicans get more rights today than democrats had in past impeachments
you would have thought that the republicans would all vote for it because it gave them more rights than we ever received in any of the other impeachment proceedings pelosi said oct
we spoke with pelosi s staff to learn what she meant when she said the republicans are getting more rights than democrats got during the impeachments of presidents richard nixon and bill clinton
pelosi s claim that republicans are getting more rights comes down to two measures the number of lawmakers involved and their power to call witnesses and ask them questions
the republicans now have slightly different options most notably there are more participants than the minorities in previous impeachments
