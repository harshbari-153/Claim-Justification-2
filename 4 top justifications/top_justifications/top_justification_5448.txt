Barack Obama "wants the government to take over health care, spend hundreds of billions of dollars of new money for health insurance for everyone."
mitt romney first response was to argue that obama wants the government to take over health care spend hundreds of billions of dollars of new money for health insurance for everyone
romney is also off when he says that obama wants to spend hundreds of billions of dollars
problem is obama plan keeps the health care system intact particularly insurance
but obama has no mandate requiring that adults buy health insurance
romney is correct when he says obama wants to cover everyone obama has said that is his goal
