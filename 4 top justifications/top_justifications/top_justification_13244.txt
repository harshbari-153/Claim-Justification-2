Says he has "a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required."
the statement from trump s campaign said he has a fiduciary responsibility to his business his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required
trump is a highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required the statement said in part
but does trump have a fiduciary responsibility to pay as little as possible in personal income taxes most experts agreed that no such responsibility exists
no such responsibility would extend to his personal taxes even if he were the ceo of a publicly traded company he said
but most experts we contacted said that while the fiduciary principle would govern how a company pays its taxes it would not apply to trump s personal tax return
