will allow members of congress to draw a second salary worth an estimated per year
in a claim about proposals for the use of campaign funds the group said that based on an estimate from the congressional budget office members of congress will be able to draw a second salary from that money worth an estimated per year

members of congress already earn paychecks
the salary has to be whatever is less the candidate s income for the previous year or which is what current members of congress earn
