The potential Iran nuclear agreement would limit Iran to the number of centrifuges needed for a weapon but too few for a nuclear power program.
if an agreement limits iran to about centrifuges that would be sufficient to produce enough material but would leave iran well short of the capacity to generate fuel to power nuclear power plants
one element that s fully expected in a arrangement is a limit on the number and kinds of centrifuges iran can use to enrich uranium
the odd reality of iran centrifuges enough for a bomb not power
we wanted to learn more about this idea that a nuclear power program would require many more centrifuges than you d need for a bomb which by extension means that limiting centrifuge capacity is just one negotiating point out of many
for now the two sides are operating under an interim agreement which rolls back iran s stock of enriched uranium and freezes the country s capability to produce nuclear materials that could be used to make a nuclear bomb
