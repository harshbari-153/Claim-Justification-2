Says Bernie Sanders was indifferent to Russia's annexation of Crimea because he felt "they have a lot of Russians anyway."
pletka said sanders was indifferent to russia annexation of crimea because he felt they have a lot of russians anyway
there s a problem with this assertion sanders has consistently opposed the russian annexation of crimea
was bernie sanders fine with russian annexation of crimea no
to the contrary we found that sanders has consistently criticized the annexation since it occurred and supported measures to punish russia
the closest potential evidence suggesting that sanders was copacetic with the annexation of crimea was his vote against legislation that would tighten sanctions on russia
