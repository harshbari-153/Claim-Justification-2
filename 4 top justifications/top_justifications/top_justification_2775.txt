"Before we even passed health care, 4 millions kids got health insurance that didn't have it before, through the Children's Health Insurance Program."
obama then listed a string of accomplishments including this one before we even passed health care millions kids got health insurance that did have it before through the children health insurance program
obama said he got health care insurance for million kids
you might not remember it but an expansion to the state children health insurance program became law very early in obama presidency
the program provides insurance to children in families who are poor enough to qualify for medicaid but ca afford private insurance
million children but that would be after the new law had been in place four years
