"We have reached our goal to clear the backlog of (unemployment) claims."
today i am proud to say we have reached our goal to clear the backlog of claims
at the end of december pechacek said the state had eliminated its backlog of unemployment claims
department of labor means the claim has been processed
wisconsin cleared one backlog of unemployment claims in late but other backlogs exist
since the start of the pandemic our top priority at dwd has been ensuring that all eligible unemployment claims in wisconsin are paid as quickly as possible
