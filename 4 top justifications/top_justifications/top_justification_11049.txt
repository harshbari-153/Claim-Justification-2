Every "one of the mass shootings except two in America since 1950 have been" in "gun-free zones."
patrick said every one of the mass shootings except two in america since have been in zones
in a web post the center said there are only two mass public shootings since at least that have not been part of some other crime where at least four people have been killed in an area where civilians are generally allowed to have guns
in a january blog post lott said since at least with two exceptions all the multiple victim public shootings in the us in which more than three people have been killed have taken place where guns are banned
in fact chuck every one of the mass shootings except two in america since have been in zones his implication being that wrongdoers don t open fire in places where permitted citizens may have loaded handguns
questioning the report the center charged in a september web post that nearly half the incidents described as occurring where civilians could carry handguns took place either as parts of other crimes or in locations and so shouldn t have been deemed mass shootings or the shootings actually took place in zones such as a wisconsin temple where guns weren t allowed according to a fox news report authored by john lott s son maxim though mother jones in reported that guns were allowed in the temple
