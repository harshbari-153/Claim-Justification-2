Says CNN deleted an online poll showing Bernie Sanders won the first Democratic presidential debate to help out Hillary Clinton.
no internet cnn did not delete its poll showing bernie sanders won the democratic debate
what isn t up for debate however is the fact that cnn did not delete its poll of facebook users who overwhelmingly said sanders won the debate
the video suggests cnn deleted the polls showing sanders won because cnn s parent company time warner is one of hillary s biggest donors spending more on her campaign than bernie s top donors gave him
the theory cnn deleted the poll to so as not to counter its narrative that clinton won
here s part of the script that was seen by millions the internet thinks bernie sanders totally won the debate
