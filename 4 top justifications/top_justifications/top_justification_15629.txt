mandela barnes saying that instead of working with trump they made statements leapt to conclusions and have participated in rallies that have done more to incite than calm the situation
in any case johnson s claim was that the rally did more to incite than calm the situation
barnes was present at a rally where a threat was made but the event was overall a peaceful one and reports of violence tied to blake s shooting came before the rally not after
