Says the CEO of Camping World told Trump supporters "Frankly, donâ€™t shop at my business."
what the camping world ceo really said after trump s charlottesville remarks
reading his comments in context lemonis was not telling all trump supporters not to shop at his store
the cnbc headline was born marcus lemonis if you re ok with what trump said don t shop at my business
frankly don t shop at my business
the claim that lemonis told trump supporters broadly not to shop at his store has an element of truth but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression
