Louisiana gets "not one single penny" from Gulf Coast offshore oil revenues.
but is the louisiana share of offshore oil royalties really zero as landrieu suggested it a bit complicated but the truth is the state makes millions
do you know how much money louisiana gets not one single penny
reasonable people can disagree over how much louisiana deserves to receive from drilling off its shores but even if landrieu has a point that her state is getting a raw deal over royalties it is clearly incorrect for her to say that the state gets not one single penny from offshore drilling
for the first miles out from the shoreline louisiana like other states gets to keep percent of any royalties produced by oil and gas drilling
either way it not accurate to say that louisiana received not one single penny as landrieu did
