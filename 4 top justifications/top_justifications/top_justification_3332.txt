"(Sen. Robert) Gordon cost us money, exempting the Newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill."
our ruling in a tv ad driscoll claims gordon cost taxpayers money by exempting the newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill
with cash flying from the image of a family superimposed over a photo of the prudential center the narrator intones gordon cost us money exempting the newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill
politifact new jersey found that gordon did vote in to exempt the newark housing authority which owns the arena from paying property taxes there
ok so newark is not receiving property taxes from the arena property but the ad claims the exemption cost us money
so driscoll s ad is right that gordon supported an exemption for the prudential center which means the city does not receive property tax revenues from the arena property
