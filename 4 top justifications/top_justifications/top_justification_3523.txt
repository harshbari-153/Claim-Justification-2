Says President Barack Obamaâ€™s debt commission recommended converting Medicare "to a system where Medicare participants are given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market."
the commission s report noted that two commission members ryan and alice rivlin director of the office of management and budget under president bill clinton had proposed converting medicare into a voucher system
in his april newsletter the fond du lac congressman posed this question to residents in the district which is north and west of milwaukee one of the recommendations put forth by the president s debt commission was to convert the medicare system from a insurance program to a system where medicare participants are given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market
so the president s commission recommended trying a voucher program with federal employees and retirees and then based on the results deciding whether to try it with medicare
the commission suggested that if its recommendation were put in place to make health insurance for federal employees and retirees a or voucher program that experience would be useful in considering a program for medicare
rather future medicare participants would choose a private insurance plan and medicare through what are called payments or vouchers would help pay for the insurance
