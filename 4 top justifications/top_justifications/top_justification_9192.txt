"The truth was revealed there in that report that showed there was no unlawful or unethical activity on my part."
the truth was revealed there in that report that showed there was no unlawful or unethical activity on my part palin told reporters on oct
i m thankful that the report has shown that that there was no illegal or unethical activity there in my choice to replace our commissioner she said
outside a sheetz gas station palin again claimed the report found she had done nothing illegal or unethical
i don t micromanage my commissioners and ask them to hire or fire anyone palin said and thankfully the truth was revealed there in that report that showed that there was no unlawful nor unethical activity on my part
but the issue here is palin s characterization that the report concluded that she did not do anything ethically wrong
