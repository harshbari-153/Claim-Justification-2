"Here are the stats: Per population, we kill each other with guns at a rate 297x more than Japan, 49x more than France, 33x more than Israel."
obama tweeted here are the stats per population we kill each other with guns at a rate more than japan more than france more than israel
in a tweet sent from his potus account on june three days after the killings obama said here are the stats per population we kill each other with guns at a rate more than japan more than france more than israel
one of the metrics included in that table was homicide rate by firearm per population
but even if some data sources produce different numbers than the ones obama cited the general pattern is the same the united states has firearm homicide rates many times higher than those in the three countries mentioned
barack obama tweets that rate is much higher than in france israel japan
