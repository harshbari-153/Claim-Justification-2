Charcoal activated tablets "will counteract most date rape drugs."
a facebook post claimed that charcoal activated tablets will counteract most date rape drugs
but social media claims on the ability of activated charcoal to counteract date rape drugs mix medicine with pseudoscience
but drugs commonly used to facilitate rape and other sexual assaults rapidly take effect and it s contrary to medical advice to ingest activated charcoal if someone is already experiencing symptoms since by then the drug has already entered the bloodstream
activated charcoal is unlikely to be effective in countering drugs used in sexual assaults
should you feel like you are yourself or out of place drink one tablet it will counteract most date rape drugs said the post which dates back to and continues to be shared
