The federal government "may put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill."
instead of a leaner smarter government we bought a bureaucracy that now tells us which light bulbs to buy and which may put irs agents in charge of policing president obama health care bill
the report acknowledged that it is impossible to know exactly how many new employees the irs would have to hire to enforce the individual mandate and other provisions of the democrats health care bill
rather than simply citing the figure she added some cushion by saying that the bill may put irs agents to work
according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office the irs would need to hire over people over just in illinois to audit the american people and impose the new taxes and mandates of the bill
all told we do think it fair to assume that the irs will need to hire new employees perhaps thousands to handle the caseload from the new health care law
