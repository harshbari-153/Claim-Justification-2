Mosquitoes can transfer COVID-19 "from person to person"
a facebook post said mosquitoes can transfer from person to person
no proof mosquitoes transfer between people
for a virus to pass to a person through a mosquito or tick bite the virus must be able to replicate inside the mosquito or tick said joseph m conlon an adviser for the american mosquito control association
u think its bad now just wait till them mosquito start transferring corona blood from person to person stated an april facebook post
while mosquitoes can transmit some illnesses such as malaria we found no evidence that is spread through mosquitoes
