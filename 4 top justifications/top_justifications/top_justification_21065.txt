If the Supreme Court throws out the federal health care law, it "would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress."
ultimately i confident that the supreme court will not take what would be an unprecedented extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected congress he said
first let s review obama s statement ultimately i am confident that the supreme court will not take what would be an unprecedented extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected congress
he simply said the law passed with a strong majority and overturning it would be unprecedented
so when given the chance to explain obama wasn t saying it would be unprecedented simply for the supreme court to overturn a federal law
it s without question that the supreme court overturning a law passed by congress by any margin is a common and routine occurrence and by no means without precedent
