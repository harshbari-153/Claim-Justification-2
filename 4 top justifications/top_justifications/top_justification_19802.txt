"Ninety percent of Texans say they do not want the nursing homes to close. It polls higher than anything else."
state sylvester turner says that percent of texans do want nursing homes to close a position that polls higher than anything else
ninety percent of texans say that they do not want the nursing homes to close turner said on the house floor march
press release from the texas health care association that said a new university of tribune poll finding percent of texans expressing opposition to cutting nursing home care exemplifies the depth of public opposition to proposed cuts
though he erred when he couched that as opposition to closing nursing homes the poll didn t ask about that it s reasonable to assume that a comparable percentage of respondents would feel negatively about closures as well
our results the poll found that percent of respondents didn t want state funding for nursing home care cut and opposition to that idea polled higher than anything else as turner said
