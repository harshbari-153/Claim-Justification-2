There is "a constitutional issue" that affects "the paychecks of members of Congress" during a shutdown.
what does the constitution tell us about congressional paychecks amid a shutdown
when asked about whether he would forgo his own paycheck during the shutdown said there is a bit of a constitutional issue
instead he said this there is a bit of a constitutional issue by the way as you know when you are dealing with the paychecks of members of congress
if people are saying the constitution is a barrier to their pay being withheld during the shutdown i d have to say the text doesn t necessarily support that
when you are dealing with the paychecks of members of congress
