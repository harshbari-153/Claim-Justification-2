facebook is creating these firstborn and secondborn challenges so the irs can confirm who y all claiming on them taxes as dependents one post says
in the irs was looking for ways to use social media platforms like facebook to catch tax cheats quartz reported at the time
no evidence this social media challenge is an irs scheme to catch tax cheats
however we found no evidence to support the claims that this challenge was planted by facebook and the irs or by a pedophile
if you search for the hashtag firstborn or firstbornchallenge in facebook you ll find social media posts from parents celebrating their children and sharing photos of them
