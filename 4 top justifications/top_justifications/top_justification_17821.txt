Says Mitt Romneyâ€™s carried interest income was a tax "trick."
barack obama says mitt romney received carried interest a tax
our ruling the obama campaign said romney use of carried interest is a trick but we find that an exaggeration
it should not be surprising that romney had carried interest income since he and ran bain capital a firm
some tax experts told us they think obama s use of the term trick is fair because carried interest is a way to limit taxes that s essentially limited to the very wealthy
by having that income taxed at percent rather than percent meant that romney may have saved more than over
