West Virginia "is the only state to decline in population over the last 70 years"
justice said that west virginia is the only state to decline in population over the last years
yes west virginia is the only state to lose population over the past years
an analysis of population numbers by state from the census and the census estimates show that west virginia is the only state to see a decrease in population over that time span
it s also worth noting that the bulk of west virginia s population decline occurred before and that the population has been roughly flat since
is justice right about west virginia being the only state to see its population decline over the past years justice s office did not respond to requests for comment but we looked at the underlying census data and it backed him up
