Shows a photo of two similar Wall Street Journal newspapers with different headlines about President Donald Trump, and describes the editions as, "Same paper, same dates, different markets. What did you just learn? Feeling manipulated yet?"
a photo shared on the internet shows two copies of the wall street journal from the same day but with two different headlines and suggests the organization distributed it to different markets to influence readers
while the photo is real and depicts two legitimate editions of the journal it is actually displaying two different editions of the paper that were produced at different times of the day and with different written before trump made a speech at a rally and one after
the papers appear to be from the same day with the same centerpiece story but with starkly different headlines
did the wall street journal run two different headlines on the same day to influence voters
it is not accurate to say that the wall street journal printed the same story with two different headlines in an attempt to influence readers in different markets
