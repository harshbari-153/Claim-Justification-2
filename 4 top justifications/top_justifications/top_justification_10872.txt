"Obama voted for the Bush-Cheney energy bill that put $6-billion in the pocket of big oil."
the announcer continues every gallon of gas takes over three bucks from your pocket but obama voted for the energy bill that put in the pocket of big oil
and so we find that clinton is right that obama voted for the bill but she using incorrect numbers about the bill that exaggerate the benefit for oil companies and her description of the bill fails to reflect its incentives for alternative energy
she claims in the ad that the bill put in the pocket of big oil
this bill while far from a solution is a first step toward decreasing america dependence on foreign oil he said
he said he wanted it to do more to reduce reliance on foreign oil but he liked the bill incentives for ethanol and clean coal
