Democrats "donâ€™t want money" to go to the Florida Panhandle for Hurricane Michael aid
trump said democrats don t want money to go to the florida panhandle for hurricane michael aid
trump s comments that democrats don t want money to go to the panhandle oversimplified a partisan fight over hurricane relief dollars
trump wrongly says democrats oppose hurricane disaster aid for florida
steve ellis vice president of taxpayers for common sense said democrats clearly want disaster assistance to go to florida
his swipe appears to a reference to the senate democrats april vote against a gop version of disaster aid because democrats wanted more money for puerto rico
