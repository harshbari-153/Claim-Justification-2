"If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible."
if you were a muslim you could come in if you were a christian it was impossible
trump said if you were a muslim you could come in if you were a christian it was impossible
in an interview with the christian broadcast network trump explained if you were a christian in syria it was impossible at least very very tough to get into the united states
so right off the bat trump is wrong that it was impossible to enter the united states as a christian
muslim refugees
