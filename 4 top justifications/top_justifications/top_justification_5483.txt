"There's never been a president (before Joe Biden) that has made race and gender the defining factor" for a Supreme Court nomination.
hannity said that before biden s recent pledge to nominate a black woman to the supreme court there never been a president that has made race and gender the defining factor
but there never been a president that has made race and gender the defining factor
but hannity s claim that biden did what s never been done before when he announced his intent to fill breyer s seat with a black woman a move some conservatives have cast as affirmative action runs counter to the long history of supreme court nominations
joe biden isn t first to prioritize race gender in picking scotus nominee as sean hannity claimed
nikolas bowie assistant professor of law at harvard law school said hannity s claim ignores the reality that from through every president made race and gender a defining factor in their selection process by refusing to nominate anyone other than a white man
