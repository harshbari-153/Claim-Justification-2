To abide by Environmental Protection Agency rules when mining or drilling you have "to take caution not to disturb bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle."
rubio said that to abide by epa rules when mining or drilling you have to take caution not to disturb bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle
so when mining or drilling jerry and tom now have to take caution not to disturb bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle
we wondered does the clean water act allow the government to regulate how mining and drilling affects bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle
while mining and drilling can adversely affect groundwater the law explicitly excludes groundwater
a new final rule currently on hold due to lawsuits does seek to clarify what types of bodies of water the epa can oversee through the clean water act
