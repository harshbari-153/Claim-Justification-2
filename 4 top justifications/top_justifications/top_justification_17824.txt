"It costs more money to put a person on death row than it does to lock them up for the rest of their lives because of attorney fees."
gary johnson former governor of new mexico and contender for the gop nomination enjoys stirring the pot within his party and on a visit in new hampshire he said it costs more money to put a person on death row than it does to lock them up for the rest of their lives because of attorney fees
the dollars spent depend on many factors including how many people the government tries to put on death row how it handles appeals and the fraction of death row inmates that ultimately are executed
at the end of the day it s difficult to make broad statements about the cost of the death penalty that hold true in every state
all of these factors affect how quickly a state processes a death penalty case and speed has big implications for a key piece of johnson s argument that it s the legal fees that make the death penalty more expensive
remember we re only talking about the legal process not the cost of keeping someone behind bars or paying for the executions themselves
