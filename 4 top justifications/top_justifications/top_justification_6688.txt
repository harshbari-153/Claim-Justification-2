The federal government "can cut all of the non-military discretionary spending and not balance the budget."
they can cut all of the discretionary spending and not balance the budget
so the government would have a deficit in even without spending anything on discretionary spending
he is making a dramatic point that even if congress were to eliminate every program except for social security medicare and medicaid which are considered mandatory rather than discretionary it still wouldn t be enough to balance the budget
or unless you accept the principle that military spending will have to be cut
rand paul says zeroing out discretionary spending ca balance the budget alone
