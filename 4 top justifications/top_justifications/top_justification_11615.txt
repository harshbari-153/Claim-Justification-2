Accuses Ed FitzGerald of "pay-to-play and corruption politics."
republican governors association portrays ed fitzgerald as a pay to play politician
cox accused fitzgerald of perpetuating a brand of and corruption politics
facts lay waste to any effort like this one that explicitly brands fitzgerald as a corrupt politician
but they have no proof that fitzgerald engaged in corrupt politics
there is little doubt fitzgerald will trade heavily on his experience as an fbi agent and his reputation for turning the page on a corrupt chapter of county government
