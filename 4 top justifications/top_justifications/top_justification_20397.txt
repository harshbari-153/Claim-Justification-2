The coronavirus canâ€™t be so dangerous because there are no biohazard bins for COVID-19 masks and gloves.
a facebook post suggested that the coronavirus is not so dangerous because there are no biohazard bins to discard masks and gloves
the types of masks used to control can also be safely discarded because the coronavirus doesn t spread or survive easily on surfaces said offit
why are there no biohazard bins for mask and gloves if this virus is so contagious and deadly the post asks
the post implies that the lack of special disposal protocols suggests the virus isn t as dangerous as it s made out to be
it does not live or spread on surfaces so masks and gloves used by the general public to protect against infection aren t considered medical waste that requires special handling
