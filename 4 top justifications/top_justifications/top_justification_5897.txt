"The Republicans didn't have a budget in '02, '04, '06."
as our related of boehner comment shows the house republicans did indeed pass an initial budget resolution every time they ran the process as the majority party even though on three occasions the gop was not able to pass a final budget through both chambers
that why the expected failure of the democratic house majority to pass a budget for fiscal year has become a talking point for republicans
hoyer said that the republicans did have a budget in while boehner claimed the house has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era
moreover the republicans ca be solely faulted for the failure in to pass a fiscal budget because the democrats controlled the senate and were unable to pass a budget resolution
in fact unlike a law the budget resolution is not signed by the president after it passes both chambers
