Says Google Earth blocked people from seeing the Suez Canal.
but the incident spurred some online to claim that it was no accident and that google earth suspiciously blocked people from seeing the canal
why d google earth block the suez canal one facebook post questions while displaying screenshots from google earth that appear to show a large portion of the canal in a starkly darker blue compared to the rest of the passage
google earth didn t block the suez canal the difference in color is from lighting camera angles
there is nothing nefarious about google earth s imagery of the canal which was there before the ship blockage occurred
the inconsistency in the water color of the suez canal is due to a difference of lighting conditions and camera angles and a similar effect can be seen at other locations on google earth
