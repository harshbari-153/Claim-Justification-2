Says Paul Ryan's budget relies on the same $700 billion in savings from Medicare that Mitt Romney and other Republicans have been attacking Democrats about.
so ryan has confirmed his budget includes the medicare savings
ryan well our budget keeps that money for medicare to extend its solvency
cutter is correct that the ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the future health care law
is that what mitt romney wants to protect and interestingly enough paul ryan protected those cuts in his budget
we should point out that the ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn t have the force of law
