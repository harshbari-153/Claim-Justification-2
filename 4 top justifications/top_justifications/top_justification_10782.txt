The lieutenant governor has the power to be an "economic ambassador" and "negotiate" on economic development
kapstein says lieutenant governor has power to negotiate on economic development
what we really wanted to know is whether the state constitution gives a lieutenant governor any authority to be an economic ambassador who could negotiate on behalf of the edc
but it was what he said about the lieutenant governor responsibilities that caught our ear the lieutenant governor has the power to go out as an independent constitutional office and has the budget to be this economic ambassador
kapstein campaign manager joe rodgers said the candidate acknowledges the ambassador and negotiator roles are not specifically defined in the state constitution but rodgers said kapstein believes an effective lieutenant governor would take on those types of duties
these days however the most significant constitutional duty assigned to the lieutenant governor is as the governor understudy when the governor elect shall die remove from the state refuse to serve become insane or be otherwise incapacitated the lieutenant governor elect shall be qualified as governor at the beginning of the term for which the governor was elected
