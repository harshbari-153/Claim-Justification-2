Ten times, no Republican candidate for president had enough delegates to claim the nomination before the partyâ€™s convention, and seven of those times "somebody who was not the leader of delegates was selected as the nominee of the party."
so the claim we re checking is that times no republican candidate for president had enough delegates to claim the nomination before the party s convention and seven of those times someone who was not the leader in delegates was chosen at the convention as the nominee
kasich said that times no republican candidate for president had enough delegates to claim the nomination before the party s convention and seven of those times somebody who was not the leader of delegates was selected as the nominee of the party
so seven times somebody who was not the leader of delegates was selected as the nominee of the party
as kasich indicated the article said seven out of the republican conventions in which no candidate had a majority of delegates the person who won the nomination was not the delegate leader
kasich replied by predicting that none of the remaining republican hopefuls will have amassed the necessary delegates in order to claim the nomination ahead of the party s july convention in cleveland
