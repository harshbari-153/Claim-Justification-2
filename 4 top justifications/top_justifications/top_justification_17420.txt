Pollsters sayÂ "don't actually believe our own data" and Gallup stopped primary polling "because they don't trust their methodology."
we decided to drill down on deace s points that pollsters are warning people not to trust their data and that gallup stopped its primary polling because it doesn t trust its methodology
deace said pollsters are warning people not to trust their results and that gallup doesn t trust its methodology
they may not even poll the general election because they don t trust their methodology
you ve got the pollsters now coming out in numerous articles in recent days saying don t actually believe our own data
as for gallup a news article implied that concerns over methodology drove its decision to stop tracking the primaries but the at gallup didn t say that and in fact he expressed confidence in the firm s techniques
