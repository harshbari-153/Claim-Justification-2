In Michigan, "we were able to really flatten" the racial disparity in COVID-19â€™s impact "and make significant progress."
i m proud to report that in the state of michigan we were able to really flatten that disparity and make significant progress he said at an mlk jr
gilchrist claimed that michigan has seen significant progress in reducing the racial disparities observed at the outset of the pandemic particularly the disproportionate impact on black residents and credited community state and local efforts
misra also credited state and local efforts to reduce racial disparities
but a surge in cases among white people has also contributed as the impact of the pandemic spread beyond detroit into predominantly white areas around the state
but another factor in the narrowing racial disparity is the increase in cases in predominantly white areas in the state
