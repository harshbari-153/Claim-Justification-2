Georgia public sector employees do not have a say in the conditions of their employment, do not have bargaining rights or a say in their working conditions.
here s the line that piqued our interest in georgia public sector employees don t have a say in the conditions of their employment
do government employees in georgia have that little say georgia is a state meaning unions and businesses can not force employees to join or financially support a union
the attorney general opinion says the state and counties do not have to engage in collective bargaining
georgia code and that opinion say state and local governments do not have to engage in collective bargaining so we believe rollins is right when she said employees can t bargain their contracts
employees in general do not have a lot of job protection said kristine orr brown an employment attorney who has worked for the professional association of georgia educators
