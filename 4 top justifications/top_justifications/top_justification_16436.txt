Says thereâ€™s not "much evidence to suggest that people have (contributed to global warming) or can do very much to change anything."
but do scientists agree with his assertion that there s not much evidence to suggest that people have or can do very much to change anything
gop candidate kevin coughlin says there not much evidence to support human role in global warming
that s because there does appear to be a scientific consensus that people contribute to global warming
while a few skeptics out there disagree there s clear scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and that humans contribute to it
the observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean together with ice mass loss support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past years can be explained without external forcing and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone
