"Every month, another 50,000 U.S.-born Hispanics turn 18 and become eligible to vote."
pundit says hispanic citizens turn and become eligible to vote every month
since nearly million more latinos have become eligible to vote
compared to hispanics that year then more blacks and four times as many white citizens turned every month
percent of the nation latino population is eligible to vote while more than
regardless it s a tad misleading to showcase that figure for latino americans when both the number of black and anglo citizens reaching voting age is for now even greater
