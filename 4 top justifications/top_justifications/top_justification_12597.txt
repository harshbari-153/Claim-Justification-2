Georgia didnâ€™t update its voter rolls prior to the 2020 presidential election; "this means we (you!) won the presidential election in Georgia."
trump said georgia didn t update its voter rolls prior to the presidential election and this means we you won the presidential election in georgia
this means we you won the presidential election in georgia
former president donald trump distorted georgia s plans to remove ineligible voters wrongly suggesting that the state failed to keep the voter rolls up to date before the election and that therefore he won
the removal of voters who have moved died or are otherwise ineligible is a routine occurrence and it doesn t change this fact georgia election officials certified the results showing that trump lost
georgia election officials removed dead voters throughout
