"We bailed out" Johnson Controls when "we saved the auto industry" and "now they want to avoid paying taxes."
clinton said we bailed out johnson controls when we saved the auto industry and now they want to avoid paying taxes
i also want to reign in the excesses of johnson controls that we bailed out when they were an auto parts company and we saved the auto industry and now they want to avoid paying taxes
johnson controls was not a direct recipient of the federal bailouts of the auto industry but it did push for the funds and as an auto parts supplier benefited indirectly
but it did benefit indirectly from a federal bailout of the auto industry
so while the money went to the automakers part of the intent was to help businesses that supply them as well
