"Geithner still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Service flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years."
according to the new york times geithner still did correct the same type of error for some years even after the internal revenue services flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years
but as for berlau statement that geithner still did correct the same type of error for some years even after the internal revenue services flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years berlau is right
after the irs pointed out in that geithner had not paid his taxes in and it stands to reason geithner would then have known that he also didn t pay in and
the transition team found a few problems in geithner previous tax returns including the fact that in addition to not paying taxes in and he also did pay them for and
there still the issue of the and taxes that geithner didn t pay until the presidential transition team pointed it out
