"Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, (President Donald Trump) said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re going to ban the bump stocks.’ Did he ban the bump stocks? No."
gillibrand said remember after the shooting in las vegas president donald trump said yeah yeah we re going to ban the bump stocks
remember after the shooting in las vegas he said yeah yeah we re going to ban the bump stocks
did he ban the bump stocks no
did he ban the bump stocks no because the nra came crashing down and said don t you dare do any restrictions on our guns around this country
in reality bump stocks were a rare area in which trump accomplished a goal sought by gun critics and his administration s rule was more forceful than what the nra had sought
