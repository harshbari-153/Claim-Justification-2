"Since Debbie Halvorson has been in politics, Illinois has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs."
in a recent television ad kinzinger said in part since debbie halvorson has been in politics illinois has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs
adam kinzinger says hundreds of thousands of illinois jobs lost during debbie halvorson career
but that does exactly mean that hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost
kinzinger would have been entirely justified making an ad that said the state had lost jobs since halvorson had been elected to the legislature or jobs since she was elected to congress
now to be fair we also noticed that if you were to start counting from halvorson as a state senator in the state had lost jobs
