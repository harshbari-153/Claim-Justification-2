"A Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol."
a cornell university research study concludes that ethanol generates a percent energy loss meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol he wrote in a recent pensacola news journal
this does attempt to evaluate the science itself but whether gaetz accurately characterized a scientific study when he wrote a cornell university research study concludes that ethanol generates a percent energy loss meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol
so does the study itself which said to produce a liter of corn ethanol requires percent more fossil energy than is produced as ethanol
gallons of gasoline equivalents to produce gallon of ethanol
that a little more nuanced than gaetz claim that a study said it takes gasoline to produce ethanol
