Says in 2002, he "won more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes, 60 percent in the state."
bush said in he won more hispanic votes than anglo votes percent in the state
i won more hispanic votes than anglo votes percent in the state
but did he really win as governor with percent of the hispanic vote higher than his percentage with white voters we decided to revisit the polls and find out
however most media analyses from the election do suggest bush carried about percent of the hispanic vote as he did in
but most of those generally accepted bush had won the hispanic vote handily
