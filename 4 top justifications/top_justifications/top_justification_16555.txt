Jason Carter supports using Georgia tax dollars to promote Obamacare
and why would jason carter support using georgia tax dollars to promote obamacare it asks
carter read the restrictions in the bill as banning georgia from accepting federal dollars not using state dollars to help explain the overhaul to constituents said his spokesman bryan thomas
but thomas when asked whether carter supports medicaid expansion said the candidate would also look at whether georgia could get the same deal that arkansas secured to take new medicaid money from the federal government to help the uninsured poor buy insurance on the private market
in summary though it is still a stretch to conclude that carter s objection to one bill translates into support for spending state taxpayer money on the law
and since we live in georgia where an atlanta poll in may found that percent of voters see a candidate s stance on the affordable care act as a very important factor in their vote it was another certainty that the federal health care overhaul also known as obamacare would get prime billing
