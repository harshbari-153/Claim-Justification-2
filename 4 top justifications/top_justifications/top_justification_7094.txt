Greenlight Pinellas "wonâ€™t take existing lanes from other vehicles."
greenlight pinellas supporters say the plan t take existing lanes from other vehicles
and more broadly will greenlight pinellas take existing lanes from other vehicles
the problem is greenlight pinellas doesn t aim to remove the turn lane from street n
so there s no intention to take away traffic lanes beyond the two greenlight pinellas mentions but there s also no possible way to guarantee it won t happen
so is it possible traffic lanes may be sacrificed even the turn lane along fourth street could capital improvements to major roadways really be made without affecting other drivers can greenlight pinellas really do what it claims it s going to do
