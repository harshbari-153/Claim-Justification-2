Obama said he would "stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction."
also the says obama would stand with the muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction implying he made a statement to that effect
the states from the audacity of hope i will stand with the muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
that i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
obama does mention muslims here at all he clearly talking about u
the distorts obama quote and misrepresents who he was talking about lumping together an entire religion when he was talking to two groups of people in the context of discrimination
