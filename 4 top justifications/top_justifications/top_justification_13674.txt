GOP-backed "racist disenfrachisement" led to only five polling places being open in Milwaukee for April 7 election.
was racist disenfranchisement behind the decision to have only five polling places open in milwaukee during the spring election
barnes claimed that racist disenfrachisement led to only five polling places being open in milwaukee for april election
he then said we have one of the most restrictive voter id laws in the country and we saw a new kind of racist disenfranchisement play out during our catastrophic april election when there were only five polling places in milwaukee instead of the usual
when asked to back up the claim chet agni a spokesperson for barnes campaign said barnes claim was not that racist disenfranchisement caused only five polling places to be open but rather that disenfranchisement was an effect of only five polling places being open
but mayer added he does not see evidence that the election officials had the goal of disenfranchising black voters when reducing the number of milwaukee polling places from to five
