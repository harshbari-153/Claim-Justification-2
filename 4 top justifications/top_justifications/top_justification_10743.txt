"As your Lieutenant Governorâ€¦I cut your taxes."
in a tv ad kleefisch declared as your lieutenant governor i beat the liberal mob i cut your taxes
as your lieutenant governor i beat the liberal mob i cut your taxes and i protected your freedoms
can the lieutenant governor who does not introduce or write legislation and does not sign or veto bills cut taxes
and she may have advocated for those tax cuts but the lieutenant governor simply isn t responsible for voting on or signing tax cuts or other types of legislation into law
taxes were surely cut during the walker administration to the tune of more than billion during their eight years in office
