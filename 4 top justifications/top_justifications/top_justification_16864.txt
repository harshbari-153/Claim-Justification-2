Says 77 percent "of Portland's students finish elementary school without taking even one art class."
do percent of portland elementary school students really graduate without taking an art class
in an effort to draw some attention to the lack of arts education at the elementary school level the creative advocacy network tweeted a pretty shocking statistic percent of all portland elementary school children graduate without having taken one art class
when they tallied up the number of students who went to a school with an art teacher they found they accounted for only percent of the students in portland schools
that district educates the vast majority of elementary school students in the city of portland and according to the methodology used above percent of their students go to schools without dedicated art teachers
one of the big takeaways from that report was that percent of oregon s public schools did not offer any regular arts courses and that nearly percent of all students attended a school with no access to arts instruction
