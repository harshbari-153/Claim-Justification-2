Says three research universities "came out and said (CPS is) the best public school system in the United States of a major urban system."
emanuel said stanford the university of chicago and the university of illinois at chicago all pronounced cps the best public school system in the united states of a major urban system
stanford university of chicago and the university of illinois chicago all three independently over months came out and said it s the best public school system in the united states of a major urban system
but even then that s far less emphatic than labeling cps the best urban school system overall
but like the stanford report it did not go so far as to crown cps school system the best overall among similar districts
it also noted that cps community college enrollment rate was lower than rates for other urban school systems
