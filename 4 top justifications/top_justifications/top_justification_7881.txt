trump said clinton claimed she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers
just look at her pathetic email and server statements or her phony landing in bosnia where she said she was under attack and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers

hillary clinton reminisced about her days as first lady and a trip to tuzla bosnia she made in march
on the campaign trail clinton has discussed the danger of the trip before and how it gave her important foreign policy experience
