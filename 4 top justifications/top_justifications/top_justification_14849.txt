politician liberal or otherwise is trying to make pedophilia legal or that they are pushing any sort of religious views or laws
the article s content seems to suggest that the democratic party s support of the gay community muslims and the successful bids of democratic muslim congresswomen rashida tlaib and ihan omar is reason enought to claim that the party is aiming to make pedophilia legal
no liberals are not trying to make pedophilia legal in the us
the claim is inaccurate and ridiculous
