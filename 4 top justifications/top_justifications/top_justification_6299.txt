Buried in the Affordable Care Act is "a huge government bailout."
krauthammer wrote in the washington post that buried deep in the affordable care act is a huge government bailout to cover up to percent of insurance company losses
krauthammer said the affordable care act contains a hidden government bailout for insurance companies that would cover up to percent of their losses
hence the concern over bailouts
the affordable care act does a complete number on the insurance game as americans know it at least in the individual and small group markets
it s the program that largely drives the concern over potential bailouts
