if question were to pass here in nevada we would have more restrictive gun laws here in nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in california he said in a june interview on nevada newsmakers
nra nevadans for freedom campaign manager robert uithoven said passing question would lead to more restrictive gun laws here in nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in california
approval of question would turn private party gun sales and transfers in nevada into a process that would more closely resemble california s existing system but there are some differences that would persist between the two states especially in the area of temporary gun transfers or loans
overall california would have more regulations on firearm transfers if question passes but would be more lenient in exempting certain types of gun transfers
passing the ballot question would make nevada look a lot more like california in terms of private party gun sales and transfers with generally fewer regulations
