A proposed U.S. Labor Department rule for children working on farms "would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose."
labor department rule for children working on farms would even ban youth from operating a screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose
the language of the proposed rule is so specific it would even ban youth from operating a screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose
does the proposal ban children from using such basic equipment as a screwdriver to fix a fence or use a pressurized garden hose to wash a truck that claim caught our eye because it sounded like simple tools that could be found in any home not just on farms
that means if dad puts using a screwdriver or garden hose on the list of the kids chores the feds won t raise a fuss
the proposed rule would limit the work children can do on farms but rooney and other critics omit that it won t apply to children working on their own parents farms
