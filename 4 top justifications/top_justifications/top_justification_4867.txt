the canadian provincial prime minister came to ohio for his medical treatment because of the delay in canadian health care which would have endangered his life batchelder said
it seemed to us that if one of canada s premiers as the top provincial leaders are known had come to ohio for medical care that it would have been a big deal but it just didn t sound familiar
