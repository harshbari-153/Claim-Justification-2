"24 of every 100 kids in school today speak Spanish."
biden said of every kids in school today speaks spanish
biden s claim about number of students who speak spanish
i know my team here knows my new team that of every kids in school today speak spanish
in an interview with telemundo the same day he made a similar statement about students that out of are latinos spanish speaking
those two statements aren t the same because not all latino children speak spanish
