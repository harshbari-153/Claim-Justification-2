John McCain said last year he didn't know of a solution to the mortgage crisis.
we wanted to know if mccain said that he did know of a solution to the mortgage crisis as obama said and to see if mccain remarks were taken in context
but obama statement that mccain said he did know of a solution to the mortgage crisis appears to be accurate given the full context of the interview
mccain told a newspaper that he love to give them a solution to the mortgage crisis he said i do know one
let stipulate that this interview does not showcase mccain at his best on issues of the economy and finance
in the interview mccain disparaged speculators who contributed to bad loans but his comments focused on how to help homeowners meet their house payments and stay out of foreclosure
