"When George Bush took office, President Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus."
when george bush took office president clinton a democrat and the democratic congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus whitehouse said
that was the trajectory that democratic president bill clinton and the democratic congress left along with those annual budget surpluses when george bush and the republicans took office
but when whitehouse says that clinton a democrat and the democratic congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus he wrong
in clinton final year in office the federal government ran a surplus of billion
any listener not intimately familiar with budget legislation from the would be led to believe that the democrats controlled congress when bush became president
