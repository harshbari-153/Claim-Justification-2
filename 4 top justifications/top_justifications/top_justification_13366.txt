"Under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats."
clinton said that under republicans recessions happen four times as frequently as under democrats
in this we decided to focus the claim that recessions are four times as likely under republicans as they are under democrats
and one of my favorite inconvenient facts is under republicans recessions happen four times as frequently as under democrats
of the recessions since nine under republicans compared to just two under democrats
so over the past years quarters in recession were about five times more common under a republican president than under a democratic president
