"We’re not even remotely close to a point to say that we’re at rising inflation."
well we re not even remotely close to a point to say that we re at rising inflation so no i wouldn t agree with that axne said when asked during a interview in des moines if she thought republicans were correct when warning that federal spending on the last stimulus distribution in march was fueling inflation
but that doesn t mean at this point inflation many of the nation s top economists are saying
axne is wrong when she says people aren t remotely close to saying inflation exists or that it isn t an issue
but he suggested inflation could be higher than the recent norm
harvard professor and former adviser for president barack obama jason furman told the associated press determining what will happen with inflation this year is complicated
