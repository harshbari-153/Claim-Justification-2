"One-third of our college grads leave Ohio within three years."
his information comes from the ohio board of regents which in under a previous administration said that just percent of ohio public college grads were still in the state three years after graduation
of our college grads leave ohio within three years kasich said at a highway engineers conference in columbus on oct
gov john kasich says of ohio college grads leave the state within years
politifact ohio thinks it is safe to say that there are not just two options at play here for those college graduates that either they found a job here or that they left ohio
to start the statement seems to overlook the fact that not all college graduates are ohioans to begin with
