"They never thought ... that I was going to release that call and I really had no choice because Adam Schiff made up a call."
they never thought dan that i was going to release that call and i really had no choice because adam schiff made up a call trump said nov
the problem with trump s statement is that schiff spoke after the white house released the memo of the phone call not before
adam schiff illegally made up a fake terrible statement pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the ukrainian president and read it aloud to congress and the american people
forced him to release the readout of that call
in an interview with conservative show host dan bongino trump said a false rendition of that call by house intelligence chairman adam schiff
