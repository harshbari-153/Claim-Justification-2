The Biden Department of Justice "would use the FBI to target parents who speak out against critical race theory."
in a campaign email kleefisch claimed the justice department told the fbi to target parents who speak out against critical race theory
it s truly despicable that joe biden and kamala harris department of justice would use the fbi to target parents who speak out against critical race theory she wrote
after he similarly argued that garland wanted the fbi to target parents who speak out to protect kids from radical curriculum like critical race theory
but is the fbi targeting conservative parents who speak out against crt
the actions of parents who show up to simply speak out against critical race theory then as kleefisch mentioned would seem to fall into the area of spirited debate which is of course protected by the first amendment
