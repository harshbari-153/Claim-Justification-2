Joe Biden "wants to get rid of something called ‘stepped up basis’" that reduces inheritance taxes.
yes biden seeks to eliminate policy that reduces inheritance taxes
a facebook post claims that biden wants to get rid of basis a tax policy that allows people inheriting and selling certain assets to only pay tax on the increase in value from the time it was inherited rather than on the gains in value from the time it was originally purchased
facebook post says did you know biden wants to get rid of something called stepped up basis how does this affect you when your parents pass and leave you the family house normally you would inherit that property at what it is worth today
if biden does away with stepped up basis you will inherit the property for what your parents paid for the property
biden has said he wants to eliminate the policy and if he is elected he can propose changes to tax law but only congress can enact tax laws
