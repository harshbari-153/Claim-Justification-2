"I argued for years that we need to move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a 'Pakistan policy.' "
i argued for years that we need to move from a policy to a policy obama said in a speech before the veterans of foreign wars national convention on aug
so our willingness to put all our eggs in the musharraf basket without understanding this other tradition and without understanding that our choice in a place like pakistan is not simply between military dictatorship or islamic rule led us to make a series of miscalculations that has weakened our fight against terrorism in the region
i believe obama is correct in stating that he has wanted to move past a strategy in pakistan for some time now said daniel markey a senior fellow for india pakistan and south asia at the nonpartisan council on foreign relations
one could argue that obama vow to act independently against terrorist cells in pakistan if musharraf would amounted to advocacy for moving from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy
what i said was that we have to work with musharraf because the biggest threat to american security right now are in the northwest provinces of pakistan and that we should continue to give him military aid contingent on him doing something about that
