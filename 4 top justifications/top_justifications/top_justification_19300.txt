Said he "opposed every budget Republican and Democrat."
so where does this leave us on marshall s claim that he has opposed all budgets regardless of the party proposing them
in congress both sides are addicted to deficits so i ve opposed every budget republican and democrat marshall says in the ad
and marshall has indeed voted against the budget resolution every year
but he voted against president barack obama s health care proposal and obama s proposed budget
moore said scott s campaign is votes in an attempt to discredit marshall a of the balanced budget caucus and a member of the blue dog coalition of conservative democrats
