"I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter."
in his answer obama made a point that caught our attention i have not said that i was a supporter obama said
we agree that obama does not support single payer now but it not correct to say that he has never supported it which is certainly the impression you get from the answer he gave at the town hall
getting back to obama statement in portsmouth he said i have not said that i was a supporter because frankly we historically have had a system in this country with private insurers and for us to transition to a system like that i believe would be too disruptive
i have not said that i was a supporter because frankly we historically have had a system in this country with private insurers and for us to transition to a system like that i believe would be too disruptive
after weighing all the evidence we concluded that obama as a candidate who was trying to appeal to a liberal electorate took a strong position on single payer but then over the years moderated his position to appeal to a broader national audience
