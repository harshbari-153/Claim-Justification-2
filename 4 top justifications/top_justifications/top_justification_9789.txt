we seen jobs created in the american auto industry since gm and chrysler emerged from bankruptcy said deese a point man on the auto recovery for the obama administration
and that s important to know because had he started after gm emerged from bankruptcy the figure for total number of jobs created would have been more than fewer
by the time obama spoke in toledo that day he said so far the auto industry has added jobs over the past two years
workers at chrysler and general motors and also at every other company in the industry
helper of cwru agreed noting that while chrysler s bankruptcy and the government s role were surrounded by questions about the legality and propriety of such intervention the gm bankruptcy was swift and it was apparent from the filing in june that the company would emerge quickly
