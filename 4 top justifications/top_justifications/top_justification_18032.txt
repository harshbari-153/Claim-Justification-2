Senate Democrats who left the state for weeks to delay a vote on union bargaining power exercised a "Wisconsin filibuster" provided by the stateâ€™s constitution.
wisconsin state senator chris larson says democrats who left the state to delay a vote were exercising a wisconsin filibuster provided by the state s constitution
filibuster the dems move was a procedural tactic to delay a vote
there are republicans in the senate
there is no dispute even among democrats that wisconsin lacks a filibuster provision used in other states and in the u
so in that sense larson is correct that the constitution gave them a tool to delay the vote
