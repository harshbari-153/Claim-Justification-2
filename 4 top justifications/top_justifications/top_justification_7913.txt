Republicans approved 12 times larger tax breaks for "people making over 350 grand" than for "the average middle-class person."
barca said that republicans approved times larger tax breaks for people making over grand than for the average person
even in our state times the tax breaks were for people making over grand than the average person
barca cites accurate figures in making the point that walker and republicans could have designed tax reforms to even up the raw dollar savings for different groups but his claim needs more discussion they said
peter barca gop tax breaks times larger for top earners
that was accurate for the major tax cuts walker signed in but the gap narrows to times larger when all of the gop changes are considered according to a trusted budgetary agency
