Says "I never billed a single hour of my time to the City of Portland in the last 10 years -- so, no revolving door."
i never billed a single hour of my time to the city of portland in the last years so no revolving door
is it true that charlie hales in the private sector never billed a single hour to the city of portland
so i held myself to that highest ethical standard and never ever had a conflict of interest with my former employer the city of portland
because we understand his response to mean that in the last decade hales never conducted business with the city on behalf of his employer
there was no revolving door because he didn t get in
