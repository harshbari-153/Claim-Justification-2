"Roy Barnes proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia."
but roy barnes proclaimed mexican workers good for georgia
gillespie said the deal statement that barnes proclaimed mexican workers good for georgia is misleading
it does necessarily follow that barnes supports mexican labor in georgia today
nathan deal campaign knows very well that when roy barnes went to mexico and praised the contributions of mexican immigrants presumably in a spirit of good will and diplomacy he was not explicitly supporting illegal immigration the professor said
the governor noted the presidents of the united states and mexico were discussing proposals for legalizing some undocumented mexican workers
