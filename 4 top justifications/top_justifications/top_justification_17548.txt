Exposure to the electromagnetic fields from power lines "has been associated with childhood leukemia and other diseases."
lynch said exposure to the electromagnetic fields from power lines has been associated with childhood leukemia and other diseases
the american cancer society lists exposure to electromagnetic fields such as living near power lines as an uncertain unproven or controversial risk factor for childhood leukemia
we were interested in whether there are any links between exposure to electromagnetic fields emf and disease particularly childhood leukemia
a large study uncovered a slightly higher risk of leukemia for children living near overhead power lines but the researchers said the findings appeared to be a fluke because the risk was seen in places where the magnetic field produced by the power line was lower than background levels
but the agency said the evidence that extremely low frequency magnetic fields of the power line variety cause childhood leukemia was limited and evidence linking the fields to any other type of cancer was inadequate
