"Fidel (Castro) has made his preferences known in the campaign and had some very unkind things to say about me."
i notice in the past couple of days that fidel has made his preferences known in the campaign and had some very unkind things to say about me mccain said
our issue is whether castro made his preferences known in the campaign
that castro had unkind things to say about mccain is clear
by and large don t like fidel castro
fidel castro no fan of mccain
