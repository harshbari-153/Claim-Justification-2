i ve got a problem where you ve got kids coming from an affluent background taking advantage of all these student loan programs and grants for higher education and who s paying for that johnson asked at a may town hall meeting in bristol
the first part of johnson s claim is that some college students who come from an affluent background take advantage of federal student loans and grants so they can afford higher education
i mean in many cases working class families the middle class who are going to college who aren t sending their kids or they didn t go to college themselves and yet their tax money s being used to fund the college educations of more affluent individuals
