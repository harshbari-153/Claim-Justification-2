sanger who founded the organization that became planned parenthood has been the subject of many claims we ve found untrue that she believed black people should be eliminated that she called some immigrants human weeds and that she was an active participants in the ku klux klan
in her autobiography she wrote that she was willing to talk to virtually anyone as she advocated for birth control across the united states always to me any aroused group was a good group and therefore i accepted an invitation to talk to the women s branch of the ku klux klan at silver lake new jersey one of the weirdest experiences i had in lecturing
no this isn t a photo of margaret sanger at a kkk meeting
