Kroger stores are charging a "BLM charge."
kroger stores aren t taxing customers with a blm charge
on an image of a kroger receipt that s being shared on facebook a blm charge of cents is circled in red
some social media users are upset over what looks like a new fee on kroger grocery store bills a black lives matter tax
the original image shows that the receipt reflected a change shortage not a blm charge
if customers pay with cash stores can load their change onto cards to spend on a future shopping trip or customers can round up their total bill to make a donation to the kroger co
