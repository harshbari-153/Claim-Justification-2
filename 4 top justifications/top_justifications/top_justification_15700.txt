"We don't get a lot of calls from this White Houseâ€¦ I have, frankly, never had a call from them."
speaking to anchor neil cavuto perry said we don t get a lot of calls from this white house
but both the white house s information and perry s own schedule contradict his claim he s never had a call from this white house
asked about his relations with the democrat s administration the republican governor said i have frankly never had a call from them
cavuto really how would you describe your relations with the obama administration perry you know i have frankly never had a call from them
governor rick perry says he never fielded phone call from the obama white house
