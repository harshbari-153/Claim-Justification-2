A bill to cap carbon emissions "could cost Ohio 100,000 jobs."
another would grant extra carbon credits to keep companies in ohio and similar states from paying too much while they transitioned to greener energy sources
the bill would limit carbon emissions while creating a trading system so companies that cut their carbon output by burning less coal for instance could sell their unneeded carbon credits
the energy tax would come from a proposed bill to curb greenhouse gas emissions
unless there was generous help to companies in states like ohio a bill could hurt because there aren t enough alternatives right now to electricity
but portman strays by claiming the cost could be ohio jobs and by saying the bill is coming our way
