Says Donald Trump's conversion to pro-life beliefs are akin to Justin Bieber's, who said in the past that abortion "was no big deal to him."
bieber has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said abortion was no big deal to him palin said
palin said bieber has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said abortion was no big deal to him
the only reasonable conclusion at this point is that bieber hasn t changed his position on abortion like trump
sarah palin says that like donald trump justin bieber once supported abortion
nonetheless we never say never if evidence of bieber supporting abortion prior to his rolling stone interview turns up we consider a different ruling
