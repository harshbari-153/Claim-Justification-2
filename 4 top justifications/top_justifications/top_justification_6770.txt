"They just exposed Mark Zuckerberg as a CIA agent."
recently a similar claim started to spread on social media they just exposed mark zuckerberg as a cia agent a may facebook post says
real news outlets such as nbc news and cbs news have previously reported on how the cia and the fbi use facebook but there s no evidence to support the claim that zuckerberg was exposed as a cia agent
no mark zuckerberg wasn t exposed as a cia agent
more than years ago the satirical publication the onion posted a video that described facebook founder mark zuckerberg as a cia agent and said that the federal agency s invention of facebook has saved the government millions of dollars
the video is no longer live on the onion s website but mashable reporting on it at the time said that it was perhaps inspired by a recent interview with wikileaks founder julian assange who called facebook the most appalling spy machine that has ever been invented
