mccarthy said the republican tax bill lets every american keep more of what they earned
referring to his chamber s tax bill mccarthy said that it lets every american keep more of what they earned
and throughout their lives this bill will let every american keep more of what they earn because the deductions preferences and that are being eliminated are available to taxpayers in only a small number of years while the benefit of lower rates and higher standard deduction are available to everyone every year
however that s not the same as saying every american will see a tax cut
every single american is going to keep more of what they earn mccarthy said at the event
