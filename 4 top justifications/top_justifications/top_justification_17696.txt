"Active duty males in the military are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer than their civilian counterparts."
in pushing for million in pentagon funding to beef up research for prostate cancer for military members he said that active duty males in the military are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer than their civilian counterparts
what caught our attention though was stearns assertion in addition he said active duty males in the military are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer than their civilian counterparts
however that same research doesn t conclude that military members are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer as stearns said
stearns is correct that research shows that military members are diagnosed with prostate cancer at twice the rate as members
still simons cautioned that the potential for drawing a false correlation existed namely that military members are more likely to get prostate cancer than members
