"Tony Evers is cutting child support."
kooyenga said tony evers is cutting child support
tony evers is cutting child support kooyenga said april on the jay weber show on newstalk wisn which was hosted that day by wisn s dan o donnell and matt kittle of maciver news service
but is it child support
so in that respect kooyenga s statement that evers is cutting child support is overbroad leaving listeners thinking evers is asking that parents pay less
kooyenga s statement was overbroad in that it suggests evers is advocating a reduction in support paid to children by parents
