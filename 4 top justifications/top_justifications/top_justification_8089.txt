"Walking in the door (Sonia Sotomayor) would bring more experience on the bench, and more varied experience on the bench, than anyone currently serving on the United States Supreme Court had when they were appointed."
walking in the door she would bring more experience on the bench and more varied experience on the bench than anyone currently serving on the united states supreme court had when they were appointed
listening to what obama said though walking in the door she would bring more experience on the bench and more varied experience on the bench than anyone currently serving on the united states supreme court had when they were appointed you might conclude that sotomayor is more qualified than previous nominees to be a supreme court justice
if we take a broader view of experience than only federal court service sotomayor is about the same as most of her fellow justices
listening to that quote you might think sotomayor was way ahead of the other justices when they were nominated
sotomayor experience does not significantly outstrip other justices
