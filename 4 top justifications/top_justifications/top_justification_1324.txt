Says Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones has raised "more money from Massachusetts than" from Texas.
hurd said jones has raised more money from massachusetts than from texas
to the contrary records show jones raising more in campaign funds from texans than massachusetts residents
was hurd right that jones has raised more money from massachusetts about a drive from the san congressional district of texas than from texas we wondered
will hurd of helotes and democratic nominee gina ortiz jones quotes hurd saying of jones when you raise more money from massachusetts than you do from texas that is not a good indication of your support
pfeiffer wrote based on the congressman quote the relevant question here is whether more money is flowing to jones from massachusetts than texas
