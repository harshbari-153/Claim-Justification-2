"There is no $30 million pot of money" for redistricting issues, including defending redistricting lawsuits. "Your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that."
that admission which is not in dispute defies weatherford other point that your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that referring to redistricting lawsuits
there is in fact no million pot of money for redistricting in the house
there are two pots of money available for lots of things but the house speaker said the money predominantly is available to fight potential redistricting lawsuits
which makes weatherford other claim that your tax dollars are not being spent on anything like that simply not true
million in the legislative carry forward fund about has been spent including for the redistricting committee
