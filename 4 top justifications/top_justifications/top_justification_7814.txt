A letter from BP to the Minerals Management Service "actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them."
the rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them
we wanted to mckay description that the rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them
mckay told tapper that the rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them
mckay is right that after bp gives its opinion that the new rules are needed it then offered a number of changes to proposed rules
we compared bp suggestions for changes to the mms regulations
