Congress' decision to "spend less around the world" on embassy security contributed to "tragedies" like Benghazi.
as for benghazi funding decisions by congress do appear to be a major factor in the attack
what even more important for this is embassy security spending grew tremendously post
farrow pointed to cuts by democrats and republicans in congress in recent years from what the obama administration requested in embassy security funding and tied it to benghazi saying it s easy to gain political plaudits by saying spend less around the world and then it leads up to these tragedies
it s easy to gain political plaudits by saying spend less around the world and then it leads up to these tragedies
how does this tie into the benghazi attack state department officials and government experts lay more blame on decisions by upper management not to provide the temporary benghazi facility with more officers and better protections than the availability of money
