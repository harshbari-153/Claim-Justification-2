"I actually in 2005 ran on Medicare for all."
i actually in ran on medicare for all the liberal issue of making sure people can buy into health care that they can afford gillibrand told a crowd gathered in a new hampshire coffee shop
her campaign began in and in she talked about a medicare for all plan that would offer a public option
gillibrand said that when she was running in she supported medicare for all
though different versions of medicare for all have existed over time gillibrand was clear about what her version meant when she ran in
i d like to see medicare be available to anyone who wants to buy into that system
