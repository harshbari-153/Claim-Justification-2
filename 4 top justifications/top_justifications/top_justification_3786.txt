"There is a precedent" for not nominating someone to the U.S. Supreme Court "in the middle of a presidential election."
supreme court in the middle of a presidential election
paul ryan wrong in saying there is precedent for not nominating a justice in a presidential campaign
there s a reason for having this tradition of not nominating somebody in the middle of a presidential election because it gets so political
it s relatively rare for a supreme court vacancy to occur in the months leading up to a presidential election
but we could find no instances in which a president faced with a supreme court vacancy during a presidential election year did not make a nomination
