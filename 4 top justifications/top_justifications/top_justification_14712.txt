"Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him."
is walker right that romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him
walker said that mitt romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him
walker argued that mitt romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him
but walker did not couch his remark that way he said romney didn t offer his business experience even as a reason to support him
the contrast governor walker was making between burke and romney in the statement you provided is that romney was running a more robust and dynamic campaign that did not focus solely or even primarily on his business experience like burke s does marr√© wrote in an email
