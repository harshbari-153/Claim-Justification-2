Says Trump "didn’t campaign on cutting the debt" … "That’s not what he promised to do."
cruz said that trump s presidential campaign didn t promise to reduce the national debt and that he didn t run principally on reigning in spending and the debt
now to be fair trump didn t campaign on cutting the debt
and trump walked back that commitment in an interview with fortune a month later pledging to reduce a portion of the debt rather than all of it
that s not what he promised to do cruz said
during his campaign trump described himself on numerous occasions as the king of debt in an effort to portray himself as someone more than capable of drawing down debt
