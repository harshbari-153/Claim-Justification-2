"Here in California, Donald Trump has given $12,000 to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris."
here in california donald trump has given to jerry brown gavin newsom and kamala harris cruz said during his speech on april at the california republican party convention south of san francisco
yep donald trump gave to jerry brown gavin newsom kamala harris
we wondered if cruz s claim about trump funding three top california democrats was correct and if so how recently had trump helped out these democrats
ted cruz said donald trump gave to three top california democrats including gov
but trump s donations to the democrats aren t recent
