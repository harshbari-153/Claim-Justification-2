With voting by mail, "you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place."
trump said that with voting by mail you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody living room signing ballots all over the place
when pressed trump went on to call voting horrible and corrupt and alleged that you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody s living room signing ballots all over the place
in his most recent comments we found no support for the notion that you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody living room signing ballots all over the place
mail voting also poses challenges for voters who move frequently or who have language or literacy issues
in every election voters wander in and want to vote there but we say it says here you already got a mail ballot
