"Putting three Republicans in my Cabinet...is unprecedented."
whatever you make of the appointments obama is on solid ground when he said his three republican cabinet appointments were unprecedented
you know when i made a series of overtures to the republicans going over to meet with both republican caucuses you know putting three republicans in my cabinet something that is unprecedented making sure that they were invited here to the white house to talk about the economic recovery plan all those were not designed simply to get some votes obama said
as you can see below in the original item it is indeed unprecedented to have three cabinet members from the opposite party
yes he said it may mean a few cabinet members can occasionally give a presidential policy some bipartisan cred
we decided to check out whether obama can accurately claim that his three republican cabinet appointments represent a bipartisan mark in presidential history
