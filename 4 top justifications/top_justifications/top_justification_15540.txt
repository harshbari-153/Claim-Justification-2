"There are actual cities" like Birmingham, England, "that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply donâ€™t go in."
there are actual cities like birmingham that are totally muslim where just simply don t go in
emerson said birmingham is a city in england that is totally muslim where just simply don t go in
this does not amount to the city being totally muslim
not that this gives any credence to emerson s claim about the city of birmingham as a whole
the city of birmingham situated north and west of london has more than million residents
