A $300 million stimulus allocation to Wisconsin "has led to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in every corner of this state."
where does all of this leave us nelson stated that an initial million in stimulus money for road projects created tens of thousands of jobs in wisconsin
tom nelson says initial stimulus allocation created tens of thousands of new jobs in wisconsin
and we were one of the first states in the country to pass and to implement a statewide stimulus that has led to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in every corner of this state
but he told politifact wisconsin he meant the federal stimulus money that was distributed throughout the state
as evidence he turns to much broader measures jobs created or saved all stimulus spending the state budget and stimulus money
