The Employee Free Choice Act mandates the "elimination of the secret ballot."
here what would happen under the employee free choice act
decertification elections where the employees vote on whether to cease being represented by their union are currently elections and would continue to be under the employee free choice act
as a practical matter elections would be far less frequent if the employee free choice act were passed
on the merits the issue which has emerged at the top of the list for me is the elimination of the secret ballot which is the cornerstone of how contests are decided in a democratic society specter said on the floor of the senate
business groups and other opponents of a bill to make union organizing easier contend that the measure would eliminate the secret ballot in union elections
