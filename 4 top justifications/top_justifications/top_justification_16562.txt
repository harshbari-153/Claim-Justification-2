kurt schrader says more republicans than democrats voted in favor of the wall street bailout
more republicans than democrats voted for the bailout that would be ironic given its widespread use as an attack against democrats these days

schrader s right on this the wall street bailout one of this election year s boogeymen was at least in part the product of the bush administration
the wall street bailout or the troubled asset relief program as pols would have us refer to it is right up there with the stimulus and health care reform in terms of fodder for attack ads this year
