John McCain wants to "give oil companies another $4-billion" in tax breaks.
here we look at obama claim that mccain wants to give oil companies in tax breaks a claim he made several times
but at the debate the two candidates had just discussed mccain position on corporate taxes and were talking about how overarching policy could affect tax breaks for oil companies
mccain discussed his support for a reduction in corporate tax rates which he said would help create jobs
the obama campaign defends this claim because mccain supports cutting corporate taxes reducing them from a maximum rate of percent to a maximum rate of percent
john you want to give oil companies another obama retorted
