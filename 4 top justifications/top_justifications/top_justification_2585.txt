Say Portland Public Schools' central administration makes up less than 4 percent of the staff.
does administration account for percent of portland public schools staff
what we can say however is that central support as the state defines it accounts for percent of the budgeted positions at portland public schools
since then central administration has been reduced by and is now less than percent of pps staff
however there s some important context in the fact that central support is a bureaucratic term that doesn t necessarily reflect the full scope of administrative employees working for portland public schools
all this is to say yes central support which is the word the school board members used in their commentary is less than percent of the pps staff
