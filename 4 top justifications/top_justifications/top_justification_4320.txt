Says "John James supported Betsy DeVosâ€™ agenda to cut public school funding and put it into wealthy private schools instead."
the senate majority pac claimed in a facebook ad that james supported betsy devos agenda to cut public school funding and put it into wealthy private schools instead
james comments followed devos effort to cut funding for the education department that year and increase federal support for private schools including a proposal for a billion grant to fund school choice initiatives in part through scholarships to private schools
that said the senate majority pac did not provide any clear evidence to back its claim that james supported devos s agenda to cut public school funding and put it into wealthy private schools instead
while james has noted his support for devos and school choice the democratic pac did not provide evidence that james specifically supports cutting funding for public schools and diverting that money to help parents send their children to private schools instead
while the ad suggests james backs the devos agenda james has not specifically said whether he approves of her efforts to significantly cut funding for public education and increase federal support for private schools
