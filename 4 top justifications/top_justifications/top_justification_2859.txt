"It is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americansâ€™ phone calls without getting a specific FISA warrant to do so."
it is against the law for the nsa to record or monitor americans phone calls without getting a specific fisa warrant to do so based on compelling evidence of a connection to terrorism
we wondered if the congressman was accurate when he wrote that the nsa can not legally record or monitor americans telephone calls without a specific fisa warrant
again westmoreland said it is illegal for intelligence officers to listen to the phone calls of americans without a fisa warrant
person then nsa is not listening to your phone calls and it s not targeting your emails unless it s getting an individualized court order
shanor said a fisa or a probable cause warrant is necessary for surveillance
