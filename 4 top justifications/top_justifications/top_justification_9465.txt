"California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which arenâ€™t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean."
gilless said the reason california s wildfires are so destructive this year is the state s high heat low relative humidity high wind speeds and high fuel loading
president trump claimed in a tweet that california s wildfires are made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which prevent firefighters from accessing water
california wildfires made worse by hot dry conditions not water policy as trump tweeted
he added in the tweet that water is being diverted into the pacific ocean
the second portion of trump s tweet that california must also tree clear to stop fire spreading is also confusing
