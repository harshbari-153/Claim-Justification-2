Scott Walker supported the same transportation bill heâ€™s attacking me for. He said at the time it would save the taxpayers money.
mark neumann says scott walker supported a transportation bill that he now says he opposed
was walker talking about the full bill with its billion in pork or the provision that moved money from light rail to other purposes and by supporting that piece of the bill was walker supporting the entire bill start with the money savings
the vote scott walker s attacking me for he supported too
so at issue now is what walker was pointing to in the money saving statement highlighted in the neumann ad
walker a longtime opponent wanted the funds to go instead to freeway reconstruction in milwaukee including the marquette interchange and the county bus system
