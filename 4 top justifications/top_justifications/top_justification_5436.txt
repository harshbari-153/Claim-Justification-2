"Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crisis in 2008."
warren said mayor bloomberg was busy blaming african americans and latinos for the housing crisis in
when mayor bloomberg was busy blaming african americans and latinos for the housing crash of i was right here in las vegas literally just a few blocks down the street holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families warren said
but that s a long way from blaming african americans or latinos for the housing collapse
warren s argument is essentially that by citing the pushback against redlining as factor in the crisis bloomberg was blaming african americans and latinos
warren makes it sound like bloomberg made a clear cut statement blaming minorities for the collapse of the housing market when that s not the case
