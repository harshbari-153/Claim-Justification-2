Says Jonathan Gruber was "some adviser who never worked on our staff."
obama said gruber was some adviser who never worked on our staff

barack obama says mit professor jonathan gruber was just adviser
gruber was an adviser
gruber may not be an architect of the bill like some have said but referring to him as some adviser is somewhat misleading as well
