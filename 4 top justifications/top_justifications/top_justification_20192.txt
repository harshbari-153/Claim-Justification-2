"Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Obamacare goes far enough: ‘The next step is single payer.' Does Sen. Nelson agree? He has in the past ... Sen. Nelson votes with Warren 90 percent of the time."
the nrsc said elizabeth warren does think obamacare goes far enough next step is single payer
nelson has scarcely mentioned single payer at all in the years leading up to the passage of the affordable care act or even since that time
nelson actually pushed back against those who said the health proposal would end up turning into single payer
then it quotes warren saying the next step is single payer
republicans mislead in ad linking bill nelson to elizabeth warren on single payer
