"DirecTV cancels OAN after Joe Biden orders media outlets and tech giants to banish voices that deviate from the regimeâ€™s official narrative."
but a recent claim spreading on social media that directv canceled oan after president joe biden orders media outlets and tech giants to banish voices that deviate from the regime s official narrative is wrong
the facebook post suggests that directv dropped oan on biden s orders but there s no evidence to support such claims
no biden didn t order media companies to banish voices that deviate from narrative
after at t bought directv in it stopped airing oan
this isn t an order and a spokesperson for directv told npr that calls from outside groups to drop oan didn t drive the company s decision to do so
