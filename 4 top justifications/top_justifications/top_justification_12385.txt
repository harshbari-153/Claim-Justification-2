Says Joseph Stalin said, "It is enough that the people know there was an election. The people who cast the votes decide nothing. The people who count the votes decide everything."
no joseph stalin did say this statement about elections
the people who count the votes decide everything
another version of this stalin quote as brandenberger called it is in the bourgeois countries it is not important how they vote but how they do the counting
it is enough that the people know there was an election begins a quote attributed to stalin on facebook on march
joseph stalin was a dictator who ruled the soviet union for a quarter of a century so it s perhaps apropos that he should opine about rigged elections
