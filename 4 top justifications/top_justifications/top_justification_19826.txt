Banks paid Hillary Clinton "over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her."
an ad by conservative pac said clinton gave speeches to banks who paid her over million and are contributing millions more to elect her
but hillary won t tell us what she said to those banks who paid her over million and are contributing millions more to elect her
bernie sanders so we decided to head to the with the ad s claim that clinton gave speeches to banks who paid her over million and are contributing millions more to elect her
the ad though makes it seem like the big banks that paid clinton for speeches are the same ones that are donating millions to elect her
and donors from the financial sector have contributed more than million to her campaign and outside spending groups working on her behalf
