"I was totally against the war in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East."
i was totally against the war in iraq saying for many years that it would destabilize the middle east he said april
trump said i was totally against the war in iraq saying for many years that it would destabilize the middle east
there s no evidence though that he advocated against the war beforehand or that he was especially vocal about it destabilizing the middle east
clearly trump opposed the iraq war in its early years
but he did not say anything that resembles his claim that bush should not proceed because a war would destabilize the middle east
