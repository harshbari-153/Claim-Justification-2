"First off, itâ€™s in statute already in HIPAA that preexisting conditions are covered."
azar by pointing out it s in statute already in hipaa that preexisting conditions are covered implying that if the aca were declared unconstitutional those protections would remain in place for everyone
additionally the aca rewrote the hipaa provisions regarding preexisting conditions bringing into question what might become of them too
however the aca rewrote the hipaa provisions regarding preexisting conditions so if the aca is struck down by the supreme court it s not clear whether even hipaa s lesser provisions would remain
azar s statement suggested that if the supreme court rules against the aca and that sweeping law is nullified americans with preexisting conditions would continue to have the protections originally offered under hipaa
hipaa s original purpose was to end what was known as job lock a situation in which people with preexisting conditions were reluctant to leave jobs with health insurance even for other positions with health insurance for fear their conditions would not be covered or they would be subject to long waiting periods for coverage
