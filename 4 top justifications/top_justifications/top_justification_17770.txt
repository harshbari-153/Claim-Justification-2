Says women who need a sonogram in the eighth to 10th week of pregnancy have to get a transvaginal sonogram.
state carol alvarado says women who are eight to weeks pregnant and need a sonogram require a transvaginal one
a woman that is eight to weeks pregnant would have to go to get a transvaginal sonogram
we decided to check at what stage in their pregnancy women who need a sonogram would require the transvaginal kind
alvarado told us that she meant to say that women who are up to eight to weeks pregnant need a transvaginal sonogram because the abdominal ultrasound doesn t always produce a clear enough image
she told us that if a sonogram is needed up to weeks into a pregnancy a transvaginal is necessary to attain a clear image and pick up the heartbeat
