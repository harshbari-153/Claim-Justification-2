The Massachusetts health care plan "dealt with 8 percent of our population," far less than the "100 percent of American people" affected by President Barack Obamaâ€™s health care law.
romney s comment offers a lot of facts to consider but we re focusing here on a specific comparison romney made that the massachusetts health care plan dealt with percent of our population which was far less than the percent of american people affected by the health care law enacted with support from obama
when romney said that his bill dealt with percent of our population the people who are insured he was using as his yardstick the percentage of people in massachusetts without health insurance
romney says his health care bill affected far smaller percentage of people than obama
according to the census bureau the percentage of americans without health insurance nationally was slightly under percent in the year obama began pushing for the bill
percent of massachusetts residents were uninsured in the period
