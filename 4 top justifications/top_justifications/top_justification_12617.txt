By advocating new requirements for voters to show ID cards at the polls, Republicans "want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws."
wasserman schultz responded well i mean if you go back to the year when we had an obvious disaster and and saw that our voting process needed refinement and we did that in the help america vote act and made sure that we could iron out those kinks now you have the republicans who want to literally drag us all the way back to jim crow laws and literally and very transparently block access to the polls to voters who are more likely to vote for democratic candidates than republican candidates
unlike with jim crow laws minority voters allow an feasible out getting an id card
today invoking the term jim crow in a policy debate seems like an unnecessarily broad not to mention provocative way for wasserman schultz to make her case against voter id laws
like jim crow laws the new laws are likely to diminish the voter pool
not long after the interview republicans pounced on the jim crow comparison arguing that comparing voter id laws to poll taxes literacy tests and other jim crow laws was not only inaccurate from a policy perspective but was tantamount to calling the gop racist
