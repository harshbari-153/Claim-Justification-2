"The years that I was speaker, the Florida House consistently offered leaner budgets than the governor offered."
the fact is that the years that i was speaker the florida house consistently offered leaner budgets than the governor offered
rubio says the house budgets he proposed in and were leaner budgets than the governor offered
leaner budgets than the senate offered
the house budget was leaner by billion or more than percent and relied less on trust funds and more on spending cuts
but it the house and senate that actually craft the state budget plan
