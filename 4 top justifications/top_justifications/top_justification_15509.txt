Product shortages are manufactured; goods are stuck in warehouses.
while some goods may be sitting in warehouses because they are not being processed quickly the issues disrupting the flow of goods to consumers go beyond that to include labor shortages at various points in the supply chain as well as a shortage of raw materials and rising transportation prices
so my conclusion is that goods could be stuck in warehouses for genuine supply chain reasons
it is entirely possible that some goods have moved into warehouses and are stuck there waiting for transportation to retailers or customers glassman said
a tiktok video claims that workers at ports efficiently getting goods off of container ships shows that the shortages of goods are manufactured
experts and people who work in industry said that there are real problems throughout the supply chain worldwide
