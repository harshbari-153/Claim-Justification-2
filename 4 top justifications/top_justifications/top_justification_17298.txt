"You know, Sen. McCain said the other day that we might have troops (in Iraq) for 100 years..."
when a voter asking a question made the point that president bush raised the possibility american troops would be in iraq for years mccain interrupted by saying maybe
because mccain unabashedly entertains the possibility of an military commitment in iraq with little more than a proviso that american personnel should not come in harm way we rule clinton statement truemccain skirted questions about what kind of troop levels are acceptable in coming decades
john mccain made in the days before the new hampshire primary that indicated his support for a prolonged military commitment in the region
mccain went on to note the united states has maintained a military presence for decades in such places as japan and south korea
