"Now, 50% of all of America, more than any other country, is fully vaccinated."
biden said now of all of america more than any other country is fully vaccinated
we created more places to get vaccinated and now of all of america more than any other country is fully vaccinated biden said in his may speech
and five other countries have higher rates for full vaccination than the united states does
the united states vaccination program is faring well by international standards exceeding all but two advanced industrialized nations in the percentage of residents who are considered fully vaccinated
the united states vaccination program is faring well by international standards but biden s assertion is exaggerated on two counts both on the percentage of americans who are fully vaccinated and on the united states international ranking
