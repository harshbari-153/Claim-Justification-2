"When a person cries, if the first drop of the tears come from the right eye, it’s happiness. But when it comes from the left eye, it’s pain."
when a person cries if the first drop of the tears come from the right eye it s happiness one post says
true or false if the first tear comes from the right eye it means happiness and if it comes from the left eye sadness the post says
but when it comes from the left eye it s pain
no shedding tears from your right or left eye doesn t reveal whether you re happy or sad
tears come from glands above the eyes then drain into the tear ducts small holes in the inner corner of the eyes
