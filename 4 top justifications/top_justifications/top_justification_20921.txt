The Obama administration has put out "more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times."
and he said that president barack obama s administration has put out more of these major rules than the clinton administration or the bush administration during comparable times
this doesn t change the facts or statistics as stated by portman the obama administration has put out more of these major rules than the clinton administration or the bush administration during comparable times
but has the obama administration finalized more of these major rules than other recent presidents that part of the claim is measurable and has in fact been examined by groups of all political stripes all using the same sources of government data
rob portman says the obama administration has put out more major rules than other recent administrations
but obama s share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules percent of all the rules his administration finalized was not much different from the share clinton had to deal with in his first term nor the share bush had in his second term
