environmental protection agency which stated that a farm with dairy cattle is similar in waste load to a city of people
but newer numbers suggest that while cows produce a lot of waste up to gallons of it a day per animal a farm of cows isn t producing the same amount of waste as people
in writing a recent decision for the state supreme court karofsky claimed a herd of cows produces as much waste as a city of people
that puts the amount of waste for a herd of cows at about the same level as humans a smaller number but one even further under the number cited in the state high court s opinion
is it true that a dairy farm of cows could really produce more waste than the population madison racine and oshkosh combined
