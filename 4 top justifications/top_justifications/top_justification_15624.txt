"Guess what, governor? Thereâ€™s no fried butter in Newark. Just 13 percent unemployment."
buono said in a new online ad about christie s trips to other states guess what governor there s no fried butter in newark
guess what governor there s no fried butter in newark buono says in the ad as a shot from the iowa state fair where fried butter is a staple delicacy plays in the back
we ll leave the butter assessment for the culinary crowd and look instead at the unemployment claim since new jersey s had unusually high unemployment figures even after the recession ended in
but percent for the state s largest city it turns out that newark s unemployment rate since christie s been governor has been quite a bit higher than buono s estimate
the point of buono s claim is that newark has had consistently high unemployment whether during the few months it was in the percent range or when it stagnated in the percent range
