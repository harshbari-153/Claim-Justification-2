Says Mark Pryor voted "to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants."
did mark pryor vote give social security benefits to illegal immigrants
the nrsc s ad claims that pryor voted to give social security benefits to illegal immigrants
so here we will look at the ad s other main assertion that pryor voted to give social security benefits to illegal immigrants
the ad makes it sound like pryor was voting to create a vast new entitlement for illegal immigrants by allowing them to qualify for social security
so while the ad is correct that pryor cast that vote on that date the way the ad described it that pryor had voted to give social security benefits to illegal immigrants is substantially misleading
