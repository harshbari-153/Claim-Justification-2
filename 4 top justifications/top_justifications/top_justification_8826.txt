"The House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era."
hoyer said that the republicans did have a budget in while boehner claimed the house has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era
so boehner is correct that the house has always passed a budget resolution even though on three occasions it later failed to work out differences with the senate and pass a final identical version and once the senate under democratic control had no budget resolution
boehner defending gop record says house has always passed a budget resolution
according to the congressional research service the nonpartisan research arm of congress the house has indeed passed a budget every year since the congressional budget act first took effect for fiscal year
so if the house does not pass a budget for fiscal year it will be the first time since the current rules went into force
