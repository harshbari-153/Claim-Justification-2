"California has added twice as many jobs as Florida" over the past year.
jerry brown said california has added twice as many jobs as florida since that state s governor visited in april on a job recruiting tour
during this span california added jobs while florida added jobs
so we focused just on brown s statement about california adding twice as many jobs as florida and whether there was any context missing
one would expect california to add more jobs than florida to keep up with the millions more people who live here
but it leaves out the important context that california is a much larger state that needs to add more jobs to keep its millions more people employed
