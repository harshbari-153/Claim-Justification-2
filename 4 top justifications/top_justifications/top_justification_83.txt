"Heidi Cruz, Tedâ€™s wife, is managing director of Goldman Sachs. They oversee the Texas utilities."
do you know one post says heidi cruz ted s wife is managing director of goldman sachs
heidi cruz is a managing director in the consumer and wealth management division of goldman sachs
goldman sachs doesn t oversee texas utilities
they oversee the texas utilities
but a claim spreading on social media that connects the republican senator s wife to texas utilities is wrong
