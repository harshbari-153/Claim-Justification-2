Says President Barack Obama "has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases (for background check failures) to go down. ... They've declined every year since President Bush left office."
sessions said that obama has allowed each year he been here the prosecutions of gun cases to go down
the president of the united states has allowed each year he been here the prosecutions of gun cases to go down
so it s correct for sessions to say that prosecutions have declined every year since president george w
when sessions compared the numbers under obama and bush he was effectively blaming obama for forgoing prosecutions of these types of crimes
obama could order tougher prosecution of cases but like his predecessors he or his appointees have determined that other crimes are more urgent and take precedence
