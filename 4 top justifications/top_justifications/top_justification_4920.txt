Says Bill Clinton "gave nukes to North Korea," Barack Obama "gave nukes to Iran," and Hillary Clinton "gave uranium to Russia."
it claims that bill clinton gave nukes to north korea obama gave nukes to iran and hillary clinton gave uranium to russia
no the clintons and obama didn t give nukes and uranium to north korea iran and russia
during bill clinton s presidency amid threats from pyongyang to pull out of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty the united states and north korea negotiated the agreed framework
during bill clinton s presidency russia actually sold to the united states kilograms of uranium that had been diluted so that it was suitable for power plants
as for russia the hillary clinton and uranium claim is totally without merit said siegfried hecker a professor emeritus at stanford university and a former director of the los alamos national laboratory
