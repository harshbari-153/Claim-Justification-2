If Joe Biden steps down, Nancy Pelosi will become vice president.
pelosi wouldn t automatically become vice president if biden stepped down
if biden were elected president and then stepped down harris would assume the office and she could nominate pelosi to become vice president or someone else
biden steps down harris becomes president makes pelosi vice president

but it s the amendment to the constitution that outlines what would happen if biden stepped down and harris became president
