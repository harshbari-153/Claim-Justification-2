Says David Wu has presided over "137 months" in which "Oregon's unemployment rate has been above the national average."
for each and every one of the months that david wu has been in congress cornilles statement in the oregonian s voter guide asserts oregon unemployment rate has been above the national average
according to state and federal data oregon has traditionally and consistently been above the national unemployment figure
but is it fair to link wu to that statistic politifact oregon looked back to when the state began tracking employment rates
the most recent time oregon unemployment rate was below the national rate was february according to tom potiowsky state economist
only for of the past months in fact has oregon unemployment rate dipped below the federal rate
