"Whatâ€™s clear is (Romney) likes firing people."
but huntsman distorted the comment by making it sound like romney was heartlessly firing employees
our ruling romney certainly phrased his comment awkwardly enough to give huntsman support for his attack
romney and me he said according to the new york times
so the notion that romney not only fired people while at bain but enjoyed it was catnip for news outlets in full new hampshire primary mode
worse huntsman said it s clear that romney feels that way
