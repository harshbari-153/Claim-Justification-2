Says library district would come "at no direct cost to the city budget."
in the original the library foundation asserted that the district would come at no direct cost to the city budget
would a library taxing district come at no cost to portland budget
it s true the city would not have to pay for the library directly but a district would mean the city has million less to work with
with that in mind we went back to the first statement that the district would come at no direct cost to the city budget
still there doesn t seem to be any debate that with things as they are now the city will ultimately have less money to work with should a library district pass
