When Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats tried to run our schools, "I've stood up to them to protect local control."
when they tried i stood up to them to protect local control
so let review sink ad claims she stood up to politicians and bureaucrats to protect local control
here are excerpts of what jennings provided in chronological order in a press release on april one day before the house vote sink stated it clear that the people of florida do want tallahassee politicians dictating a rigid policy to our local school districts
one other question to raise about sink claim is it fair to say that politicians and bureaucrats tried to run our local schools for senate bill we will define bureaucrats as florida commissioner of education eric j
and i stand up to them again as a parent and as your governor
