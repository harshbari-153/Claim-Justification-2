SaysÂ Sean Casten supports "doubling premiums" and "cutting current health care plans."
roskam alleges that casten supports doubling premiums and cutting current health care plans for illinois families
casten has made protecting and expanding health care access under obamacare formally known as the affordable care act a top priority of his campaign
casten doesn t support doubling premiums or reducing roskam s campaign could point to nothing that said he did
if it happened in the past it surely then will happen in the future vera reasoned and so to the roskam campaign that means casten backs a doubling of premiums
the crux of roskam s argument centers on casten s support for expanding obamacare options
