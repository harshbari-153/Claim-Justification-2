"I have not changed my position on the (gay) marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage."
interview on msnbc romney said i have not changed my position on the marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage that
consistent on gay marriage not on amendment
he is correct that he has been consistent in his opposition to marriage but has changed his position as to the scope of an amendment that he would supportsenate he told a gay newspaper that the definition of marriage was a state issue as you know the authorization of marriage on a basis falls under state jurisdiction
in when romney was governor his wife son and signed a petition supporting a proposed amendment to the massachusetts constitution that would not only ban the state from recognizing marriages but further stated any other relationship shall not be recognized as a marriage or its legal equivalent nor shall it receive the benefits or incidents exclusive to marriage
