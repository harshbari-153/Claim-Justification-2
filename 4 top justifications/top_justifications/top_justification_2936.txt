"In the United States, 50 percent of social services are provided by the Catholic church."
keating said in the united states percent of social services are provided by the catholic church

in the economist reported that percent of catholic charities support came from local state and federal government agencies
he s right that catholic groups are among the biggest providers of charity in the nation but it doesn t appear that they account for half of all such charity
we re admittedly using a bit of guesswork but catholic charity seems to account for percent to percent of all nonprofit charity depending on how generous an estimate you make
