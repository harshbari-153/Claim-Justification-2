In every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction, "there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first."
grayson said that in every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction there been an investigative subcommittee that been established first
in every single instance where there been any formal sanction an expulsion a reprimand or a censure of any member in every one of those cases since the office of congressional ethics was established there been an investigative subcommittee that been established first he said
the house ethics committee is not necessarily bound to begin an investigative subcommittee in these cases
let s look at how ethics investigations work
we wondered whether grayson was right that formal sanctions have only followed the creation of an investigative subcommittee
