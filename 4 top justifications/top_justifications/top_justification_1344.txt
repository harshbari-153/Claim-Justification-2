"President Obama and Democrats' spending addiction has driven our national debt to historic proportions, maxed out our national credit card and has now led to the Democrat Downgrade of our country's AAA credit rating."
president obama and democrats spending addiction has driven our national debt to historic proportions maxed out our national credit card and has now led to the democrat downgrade of our country aaa credit rating he said
one citation is a story from politico saying that obama is now firmly part of the landscape that s p trashed after the story says he was dragged by hill republicans into the endless fiscal and personal nightmare that was the debt ceiling debate
the other sources mostly commentaries fault obama leadership on the economy tie democrats to spending or speculate on the political damage to obama and democrats from the downgrade
one was a politifact story that referred to obama as the undisputed debt king of the last five presidents
although democrats shoulder a fair amount of blame for the nation fiscal woes so do republicans because they voted for tax cuts and additional spending that also contributed to the large deficits
