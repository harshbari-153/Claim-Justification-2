"This administration and this Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control."
this administration and this congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the democrats took control pence said
but when pence said this administration and this congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the democrats took control that wrong
i mean the democrats have cut of a trillion out of this and the president wants to go to percent of the level that republicans spent on border security
but pence repeatedly said that funding for border security has been steadily cut by democrats since
rather democrats have shifted funding from border fencing to other border security items such as increasing the number of border patrol officers
