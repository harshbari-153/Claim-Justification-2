"In Chesterfield (Va.), the Southside precinct is infamous for having over 100% of the vote countâ€¦"
there are situations historically like i know in chesterfield the southside precinct is infamous for having over of the vote count which really should be impossible if they re doing what they re supposed to be doing
chase trying to prove there s voting fraud in virginia says chesterfield s southside precinct is infamous for logging more votes than there are voters
records show the southside precinct has voted overwhelmingly democratic in each of contested elections it has seen since its start
the precinct was established in and its highest turnout came that year when of its voters cast ballots in the presidential election won by democrat barack obama
but i know in years past i ve actually before i ran for office i worked behind the scenes to get republicans elected and i would go to the southside precinct because i remember it historically having over voting and i m like that s a precinct i want to go work and i actually saw voters coming in with stacks of votes
