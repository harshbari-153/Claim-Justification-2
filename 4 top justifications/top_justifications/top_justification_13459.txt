Says a photo shows President Ronald Reagan meeting with Taliban leaders in the White House.
social media posts claim a photo of president reagan seated in the oval office shows him meeting with members of the taliban
tweet that featured the photo a president meeting with the taliban this is horrific
and shows reagan meeting with afghan freedom fighters in the oval office to discuss soviet atrocities in afghanistan
besides being retweeted over times this flawed claim also migrated to facebook where in one version text surrounding the image declares ronald reagan meets with the taliban
in the image former president ronald reagan is seated in the oval office with a group of men wearing turbans
