betty sutton an organized crime syndicate was extorting money from his business threatening his family but he fought back and won the fbi highest civilian award
ganley wore a wire when he met with the extortionists and asked questions at the fbi request to help the bureau crack other cases former fbi agents said
retired fbi agents contacted by the plain dealer described ganley s actions as courageous and important to the fbi s investigative strategy
generally ganley has portrayed his role the way he portrays it in his political ad someone who helped the fbi with an investigation
truth be told though we felt bad about putting a mark against ganley s reputation in what is by all accounts a laudable act endangering himself in the interest of justice
