"$120,000 will be spent by taxpayers on Charlie Crist's political photo-op special session."
rubio wrote in a july press release will be spent by taxpayers on charlie crist political special session
swindle said several years ago both the house and senate appropriation bills allotted an additional per day for each body for special sessions if they needed it and that likely why it the most common figure used
if legislators want to bring an aide most do for a brief special session that is paid for out of their district funds which are also taxpayer dollars
charlie crist called for a special session july for legislators to put a constitutional amendment on the november ballot to ban oil drilling near florida coasts
clearly crist will get news coverage including out of the special session as will legislative leaders from both parties
