"The United States is the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave."
obama said the united states is the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave
in his piece obama claimed the united states is the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave
of the developed countries not only is it the only one that does not offer or require paid maternity leave it is also mandates the shortest period of time off

the united states is the only developed country to meet none of the benchmarks and one of just studied worldwide
