"Less than half" of jobs at the Carrier manufacturing plant in Indiana "are actually staying."
in fact more than half of the jobs will stay in the united states because the deal is keeping approximately jobs out of at the carrier plant
mcghee said that less than half of the jobs from the carrier deal actually stayed in the united states
going by the broader view mcghee is right that less than half or percent of the jobs in danger of being exported actually ended up staying
so that s more than half or percent of the estimated jobs that were slated to be lost from the indianapolis plant
that s a bit lower than the more than jobs talking point we ve heard from pence trump and carrier
