"No one" claims the report vindicating New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the bridge scandal is "conclusive."
giuliani one says bridge report that vindicates new jersey gov chris christie is conclusive
the broader point here of course is that critics of the report say the investigation is anything but conclusive as it was ordered by christie
giuliani said no one called the mastro report conclusive
but one of the targets of the investigation christie said it would stand the test of time and the main investigator stated bluntly there was not a shred of evidence that christie is to blame
christie and mastro admit some blind spots exist in the report but those relate mostly to understanding why kelly and wildstein closed the bridge and not christie
