"Prop 56 cheats schools out of at least $600 million."
we wondered whether there s any truth to the claim that prop cheats schools out of all that money
the claim that prop cheats schools goes too far
when i think of this claim that the schools are going to be cheated particularly that word cheated out of this money that suggests something that s wrong or illegal
its campaign says online and in radio ads that the measure cheats schools out of at least million a year
this does mean however that money will be taken from schools or community colleges under prop
