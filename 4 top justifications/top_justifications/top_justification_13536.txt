"The CDC actually put together a document to discuss putting high risk people into camps to ‘shield’ low risk people from them."
owens drew attention to the document by tweeting the cdc actually put together a document to discuss putting high risk people into camps to shield low risk people from them
owens tweeted that the cdc put together a document to discuss putting high risk people into camps to shield low risk people from them and she likened it to germany
by referencing germany owens tweet gives the impression that the cdc proposed putting people into camps to mitigate the virus
the purpose of this document is to highlight potential implementation challenges of the shielding approach from cdc s perspective and guide thinking around implementation in the absence of empirical data the document said
but owens statement mischaracterized the purpose and findings of a cdc document that explored the merits and flaws in one method suggested as a means of stemming transmission in refugee camps and other humanitarian settings
