jim demint says sen sherrod brown is responsible for over trillion in debt
so does brown bear the responsibility for the debt as demint claims hoskins acknowledged that brown is not solely responsible for the debt but said brown s still a major cause

politifact ohio tripped over demint s line that brown is responsible for the country s trillion debt and decided to ask demint to explain brown s culpability
he also said that brown has voted for other democratic spending bills and earmarks and has voted to raise the debt ceiling at least three times
