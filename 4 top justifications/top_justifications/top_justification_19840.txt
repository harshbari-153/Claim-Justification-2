"We have roughly between 85,000 (and) 95,000 open jobs in Wisconsin."
you going to see that on a basis we have roughly between and open jobs in wisconsin and yet we only have about folks who are currently on unemployment
does wisconsin really have between and available jobs
while making a point about the gap between wisconsin s and available jobs kleefisch claimed in late december that wisconsin had roughly to open jobs on a state website
it s reasonable to include those jobs in a database for wisconsin job seekers but those aren t wisconsin jobs
he said many of those jobs are still performed in wisconsin through telecommuting or travel
