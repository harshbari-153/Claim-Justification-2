the announcer says he leading by example refusing contributions from pacs and washington lobbyists who have too much power today
in his speeches and his tv ads barack obama criticizes the influence of lobbyists
he almost always qualifies his statement to note that he wo take money from federal lobbyists a distinction that allows him to accept money from state lobbyists
but his policy includes one caveat and a few loopholes that weaken his claim to be funding his political campaign in a way that truly different from his competitors
while obama can accurately say that he does not accept money from federally registered lobbyists he still accepts thousands from people in the influence industry
