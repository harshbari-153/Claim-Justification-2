Says that Mitt Romney, while he was in Arizona, said he believes the stateâ€™s SB 1070 immigration law should be the model for national immigration laws.
romney has actually said while he was in arizona of course and i understand that he was basically maybe playing up to the arizona crowd he felt that sb which has made its way up to the supreme court of the united states and will be argued in april he believes that it should be the template it should be the model for united states immigration law not comprehensive immigration reform as the more responsible individuals in congress have been espousing for a number of years but an extreme version of an law passed by the arizona legislature
in a march conference call organized by the democratic national committee gonzalez said that while in arizona romney said he believes that the state s law which originated in as senate bill should be the template for federal immigration laws a stance that gonzalez described as disturbing
charlie gonzalez says that in arizona mitt romney said the state s sb law should be model for nation
so romney in the debate saluted the element of a arizona law which was not part of the law that gonzalez says romney called a model for the nation
of course saying he wouldn t sue states that adopt sb laws isn t the same as saying that arizona s law should be the model for federal immigration laws
