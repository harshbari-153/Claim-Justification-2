Says the CDCâ€™s new tracking policy is covering up cases of "breakthrough" COVID-19 infections among vaccinated people.
a facebook post says a new cdc tracking policy is meant to cover up cases of breakthrough infections among vaccinated people
the latest publicly available cdc data showed that out of million people who were fully vaccinated as of april there were at least recorded breakthrough cases
a change in the way federal health officials are tracking breakthrough cases among vaccinated people has prompted claims on social media that the government is maneuvering to manipulate or hide negative information about the vaccines
according to the centers for disease control and prevention a breakthrough case occurs when a person who has been fully vaccinated still contracts the disease
while the three vaccines currently available in the united states drastically reduce the chances of infection health officials caution that no vaccine is effective so some breakthrough cases are expected to occur and the cdc has been tracking them to monitor the effectiveness of the vaccines
