"The minute this proposal for near-beach oil drilling came up, I was against it."
we were struck by sink claim that she opposed a proposal for oil drilling the minute it came up
sink says she opposed drilling the it was proposed in
in a speech to the suncoast tiger bay club in clearwater on june sink responded to a question about how she would handle the crisis as governor clearly we are in uncharted territory here because while other parts of the world have been subject to oil spills and by the way the minute this proposal for oil drilling came up i was against it and that why i support a constitutional amendment for the people of florida to be able to say never will we have drilling within miles of our shore
that why i strongly oppose the drilling legislation which would threaten florida s economy by bringing oil rigs miles off our coast sanctioning drilling in the shallow waters of the gulf and allowing unlimited pipelines to go through sensitive areas up to our beaches
it clear sink is opposed to drilling off florida coast but she said in her statement that she opposed the idea the minute was floated in
