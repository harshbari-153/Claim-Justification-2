"We have an America where â€¦ hard-working families have flat wages."
warren said that we have an america where families have flat wages
the part that caught our ear was what warren said about flat wages
the next thing you know we have an america where the gross domestic product keeps going up where corporate profits keep going up where the stock market keeps going up and where families have flat wages and rising expenses for health care for housing for child care for trying to send a kid off to school she said during a cnn town hall in new hampshire
so working americans actual income flows may be higher than is indicated by their wages alone
warren says with respect to real wages is frequently said by political leaders but it is incorrect said gary burtless a brookings institution economist
