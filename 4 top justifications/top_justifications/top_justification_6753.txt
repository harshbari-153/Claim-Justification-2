Before Obamacare, Wisconsinâ€™s "high-risk pool" for health insurance "had eight or nine" plans to choose from, people "could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted, and their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today."
ryan says that before obamacare wisconsin s pool for health insurance had eight or nine plans to choose from people could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted and their premiums and were cheaper than they are under obamacare today
also wisconsin s pool did not contain the same coverages as obamacare plans for example it had a lifetime limit for benefits whereas obamacare does not
finally ryan s staff pointed out that wisconsin s deputy insurance commissioner has told congress that people in the pool had to pay more for coverage under obamacare
kaiser s pollitz told us that if medical inflation were taken into account the wisconsin pool costs would generally be higher than the current obamacare rates
and pools expert jean hall a kansas university health policy professor told us that people who qualify for subsidies under obamacare are getting more coverage for less money than they were with wisconsin s pool even if there were cases where people with higher incomes got a better deal with the pool
