some of you are being injected with saline because it would look too suspicious if everybody died at the same time the post says
the suggestion that people are being injected with saline as part of a bigger deadly plot against humanity is unfounded and defies evidence
a meme being shared on social media suggests there s a nefarious plot to kill vaccine recipients because of reports of some people receiving shots of just saline
saline is used to dilute the vaccine from pfizer before it s injected
receiving a saline injection isn t harmful and millions of vaccine doses have been safely administered in the united states
