"There are 278 Republicans in Congress. (With Eric Cantor's defeat), they are now all Christian and all white except for one black senator, who was appointed."
does cantor s primary defeat mean republicans in congress are now all white and all christian
without cantor maher said the gop in congress is now all christian and all white except for one black senator who was appointed
bill maher says without eric cantor the republicans in congress are all white and all christian
they are now all christian and all white except for one black senator who was appointed
one more critical point when maher says the republicans in congress are now all white and all christian that s not accurate cantor isn t going anywhere yet
