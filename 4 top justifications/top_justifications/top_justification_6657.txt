"When those restrictions expire (in the Iran nuclear deal), Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go."
trump said when those restrictions expire iran will have an military nuclear capability ready to go
but when those restrictions expire iran will have an military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad iran behavior is
so in sum after the limits expire it would likely still take iran between several months and a year or so to have an actual deliverable nuclear weapon
it is correct that after years the limitations that prohibit iran from enriching enough uranium to create a bomb will expire
and even if iran were to go for a nuclear program once the limit on uranium enrichment goes away it would take months if not years for the country to develop a bomb and delivery system so its military could go to war with nuclear weaponry
