"We made a ridiculous deal (with Iran). We gave them $150 billion. We gave them $1.8 billion, and we got nothing."
in a news conference alongside french president emmanuel macron trump said the united states had made a ridiculous deal with iran

as for whether the united states got nothing from the deal that view puts a value of zero on rolling back iran s nuclear program which the agreement accomplished
