Says President Barack Obama is responsible for pending defense cuts.
is president barack obama planning large defense cuts we contacted both campaigns for this report but didn t hear back
actually obama has said he opposes the major defense cuts set to take effect in fiscal year
i do not believe it accurate to refer to the cuts that will occur in both defense and discretionary spending under sequestration as obama cuts he said
obama s negotiating team came up with the idea for defense cuts in but they were intended to motivate congress to come up with a better deal for reining in the deficit not as an effort to make those cuts reality
a new ad for mitt romney says obama s defense cuts are set to threaten thousands of jobs
