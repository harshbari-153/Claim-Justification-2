"While the government grew, we lost more than 2 million jobs."
while the government grew she said we lost more than million jobs
and when she says that we lost more than million jobs she could mean employment overall or employment only as a counterpoint to the government employment she cited in the first half of the comparison
now what about bachmann s claim that we lost more than million jobs neither total national employment nor employment declined by anything close to her number at least during the period she appeared to specify
sought to draw a contrast between the hemorrhaging of jobs nationally and an expansion of jobs in government
both of those measures lost jobs during that period
