we get practically nothing compared to the cost of this
forces are no longer there strictly to defend south korea said william w
calculating the south korean financial burden on a percentage basis is tricky because it s difficult to determine how much it costs the united states to station military personnel in south korea
the united states itself benefits from the military investment in south korea they said
currently south korea pays well over million annually to support the united states troop presence an amount that doesn t qualify as practically nothing
