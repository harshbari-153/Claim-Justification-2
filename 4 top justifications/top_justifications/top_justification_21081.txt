"He told gay organizers in Massachusetts he would be a stronger advocate for special rights than even Ted Kennedy."
he told gay organizers in massachusetts he would be a stronger advocate for special rights than even ted kennedy
mccain is right that romney promised to be more supportive of gay rights than kennedy had been but he loses some points by using the term special rights
what romney actually advocated was equality for gay and lesbian americans nothing special
he supported abortion on demand even allowed a law mandating taxpayer funding for abortion
during the race romney wrote a letter to the log cabin republicans a group of gay republicans thanking them for their support
