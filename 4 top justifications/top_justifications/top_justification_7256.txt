Says Dan Sullivan approved a "light sentence" for a sex offender who got out of prison and is now charged with a gruesome murder and sexual assault.
begich said sullivan approved a light sentence to a sex offender who is now charged with murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their granddaughter
the party pointed out that sullivan was attorney general in march when prosecutors negotiated a plea agreement with active who at the time was charged with sexual abuse of a minor among other charges
and these presumptive sentencing policies had been in place since the late so when sullivan entered the office these practices were already
so although active s plea agreement and sentencing happened in while sullivan was in office the mistake that led to active s shorter sentence happened more than a year earlier
the laws passed include harsher sentences for people involved with child pornography or human trafficking revision of bail laws for people charged with serious crimes and specified procedures for dna retention in murder and sexual assault cases
