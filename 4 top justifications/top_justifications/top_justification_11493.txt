President Barack Obama has "announced that he would not sign ANY spending bills this year unless sequestration spending cuts are eliminated."
boehner said that obama has announced that he would not sign any spending bills this year unless sequestration spending cuts are eliminated
last month through a series of statements of administration policy the president announced that he would not sign any spending bills this year unless sequestration spending cuts are eliminated and replaced with his plan for higher taxes wrote house speaker john boehner in a statement on his website on july
did obama really say he would not sign the bills and did obama s potential veto hinge on sequestration spending cuts being eliminated
meanwhile obama did say he opposed bills enacting the house republican budget but he didn t make restoration of sequestration cuts a demand in any negotiated deal
so he s saying he won t sign these bills absent a plan to do away with sequestration
