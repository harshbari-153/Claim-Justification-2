"There's not one Democrat who endorses" the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan.
our ruling biden said there s not one democrat who endorses the republican proposal to fundamentally restructure medicare
joe biden says no democrats support paul ryan s medicare proposal
the plan on medicare is further proof that mitt romney is singularly unfit to end gridlock and bring bipartisan solutions to washington he wrote
he also found himself fending off suggestions by romney that he abetted the republicans medicare plan
wyden was the only democrat to endorse ryan s idea of premium support in medicare and his approval has clearly been revoked
