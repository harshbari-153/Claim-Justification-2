Says "taxes were raised 115 times in the eight years before I became governor" and those increases were part of a "path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state."
our ruling during his keynote address christie claimed taxes were raised times in the eight years before i became governor and those increases were part of a path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state
but christie also described those taxes as part of a path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state
chris christie claims in keynote address that taxes in new jersey were raised times in eight years
in the eight years before he took office state officials approved roughly increases in taxes and fees or other tax policy changes
now they said it was impossible this is what they told me to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised times in the eight years before i became governor
