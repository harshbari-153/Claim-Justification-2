"I released all my emails."
bush said i released all my emails
i released all my emails i m writing an about my emails
jeb bush says he has released all his emails from time as governor
the bush campaign also did not confirm to us whether he meant he d released all the emails from his private server but it s pretty clear he did not release every single one
so that means he didn t literally release all his emails just the ones he says he was required to give the state
