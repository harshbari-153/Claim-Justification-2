Taxpayers are "on the hook ... for less than a third" of the proposed new Atlanta Falcons stadium, and those funds are "repaid from money that comes from outsiders."
are taxpayers on the hook
but the majority of the projected million in taxes for stadium construction would be paid by outsiders
if this were the only pot of public funds going to the stadium then this portion of deal s claim would be correct
we think viewers may have gotten the impression that deal was talking about the total burden to taxpayers
the public may be wary but key elected officials are warming up to the idea of helping the atlanta falcons build a new stadium for the low low price of billion
