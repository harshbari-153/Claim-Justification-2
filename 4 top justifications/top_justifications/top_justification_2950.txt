Nancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House
house session claims that it shows that pelosi is no longer house speaker
nancy pelosi was speaker of the house for the congress on jan
that s a complete misreading of the clip pelosi is still the house speaker
the facebook user who shared the video inaccurately claims that it shows pelosi is no longer speaker of the house as of that date
this is standard procedure and doesn t indicate that pelosi resigned as speaker eight days after being to the position
