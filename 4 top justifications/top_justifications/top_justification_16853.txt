power was not taken away from the attorney general
roth said laws didn t take any power away from the incoming governor or attorney general contradicting even the explanation from other leaders in his party
did the actions really take away no power from the two incoming democrats
board the power to appoint the head of the agency a power previously given to the governor
the end result here is there will be more legislative oversight in a lot of areas but no power was taken away from the governor said roth
