"Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare."
trump said under my administration million americans have come off of food stamps and million people have been lifted off of welfare
in his third state of the union address president trump claimed that since he took office million americans have come off of food stamps and million have been lifted off of welfare
trump s claim that million americans have come off food stamps since he took office isn t too far off although some discrepancies in reporting show slightly skewed data
trump s claim that million people were lifted off of welfare doesn t add up
there are around million fewer americans participating in snap sometimes called food stamps than when trump entered the white house according to figures from the department of agriculture
