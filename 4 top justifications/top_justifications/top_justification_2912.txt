Harry Reid has voted "to give special tax breaks to illegal aliens."
in this item we focus on the part where the narrator says harry reid he votes to give special tax breaks to illegal aliens
however we find little to support the charge that reid voted to give special tax breaks to illegal aliens
so how persuasive are these four examples of reid voting to give special tax breaks to illegal aliens they did persuade us
you can disagree over the merits of the amendment but we do buy that reid vote against it amounted to supporting a special tax break
we check whether reid voted to give illegals social security in a separate item
