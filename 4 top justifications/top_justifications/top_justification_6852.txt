"Trump: police officers and firefighters make too much moneyâ€¦hits them with tax penalty."
trump police officers and firefighters make too much money
bluedot daily said trump police officers and firefighters make too much money
headline misleads about president trump police and tax deductions
while bluedot daily made it appear that trump targeted police officers and firefighters salon cited several types of workers who have taken the deduction in the past and will no longer be able to do so under the new tax law
and we found no evidence that trump stated that police and firefighters make too much money
