"Because of Barack Obama the mission in Iraq ended."
our ruling the obama campaign ad the original one said because of barack obama the mission in iraq ended
a campaign ad touting four of obama s accomplishments as president includes this assertion because of barack obama the mission in iraq ended
about months later he declared that the american combat mission in iraq was ending
it marked the fulfillment of a campaign promise obama made to end the war directing military leaders to begin withdrawal
the war despite the goals obama met most of the timetable for leaving iraq was in place before he took office
