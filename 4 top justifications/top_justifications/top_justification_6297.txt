"Two-thirds of Wisconsin corporations don't pay state income taxes."
one wisconsin now says of wisconsin corporations don t pay state income taxes
what s the bottom line the liberal institute for one wisconsin used state data to assert that of wisconsin corporations pay no state income taxes
efforts to make that case have often centered on this phrase of wisconsin corporations do pay state income taxes
a significant number of individuals as opposed to corporations also do not have a tax liability
but that s just a slice of how many firms got tax preferences to reduce their corporate income taxes
