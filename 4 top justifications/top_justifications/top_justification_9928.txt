"Right now, the (Congressional Budget Office) says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year."
our ruling romney said right now the congressional budget office says up to million people will lose their insurance as obamacare goes into effect next year
during the first presidential debate in denver mitt romney criticized president barack obama s health care law by saying right now the congressional budget office says up to million people will lose their insurance as obamacare goes into effect next year
we did so in june when romney made a similar claim in a speech that obamacare means that for up to million americans they will lose the insurance they currently have the insurance that they like and they want to keep
some who lose coverage will do so because they find better options even beyond the romney is wrong to say that million americans will lose their insurance
mitt romney says up to million will lose health insurance due to obama health care law
