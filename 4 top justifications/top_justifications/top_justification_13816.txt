"Property taxes had increased 70 percent in the previous 10 years."
property taxes had increased percent in the previous years christie said according to the text of his speech
our ruling christie said during his budget address that property taxes had increased percent in the previous years to him becoming governor
still the overall point here is that property taxes jumped significantly in the decade before he became governor
but we learned a couple of things first the increase was actually slightly higher than percent but it falls once property tax rebates are factored into the mix
when those rebates are deducted from the average property tax bill the increase over the decade before christie took office comes in under percent
