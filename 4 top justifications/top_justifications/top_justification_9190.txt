"Believe it or not, consumer spending is up over the last eight months."
believe it or not consumer spending is up over the last eight months ok he said
so saying that consumer spending is up over the last eight months isn t too different from saying it is warmer in july than january
kasich is correct though that consumer spending measured in dollars has been risen overall the past eight months
gov john kasich says consumer spending has actally increased the last eight months
in fact the spending comparison shows that real consumer spending has been higher than the year ago amount since december
