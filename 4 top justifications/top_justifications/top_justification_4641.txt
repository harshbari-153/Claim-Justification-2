Washington politicians "run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme."
they going to tell you i said washington politicians have run social security like a ponzi scheme
the candidate says politicians run social security like a ponzi scheme
the television ad is similar with johnson instead saying washington treats social security like a ponzi scheme
said steuerle to the extent that the candidate is arguing that social security is run like a ponzi scheme in the sense that there s really no significant savings in the system that s right
a trillion ponzi scheme now that would be a crime especially since social security affects virtually every american
