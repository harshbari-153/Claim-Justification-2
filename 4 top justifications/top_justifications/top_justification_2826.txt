Says David Vitter "answered a prostituteâ€™s call minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers who gave their lives in defense of our freedom."
john bel edwards who answered our country s call and served as a ranger in the airborne division or david vitter who answered a prostitute s call minutes after he skipped a vote honoring soldiers who gave their lives in defense of our freedom
the ad makes two claims about vitter he skipped a vote for a resolution honoring american soldiers killed in the line of duty and he answered a call from palfrey s phone soon after
but the key parts of the statement in question that vitter answered a prostitute s call minutes after he skipped a vote are accurate
edwards ad says vitter took a call from a prostitute minutes after skipping the vote
the choice doesn t quite close the deal in suggesting that vitter missed the vote because of his dealings with a prostitute which is what it suggests when it says he chose prostitutes over patriots
