"We had the biggest drop of the rate of unemployment (in)Â all but 4 states."
we had the biggest drop of unemployment the rate of unemployment of all but four states

we wondered if rhode island had experienced the biggest drop of unemployment
lincoln chafee says as governor only four states had bigger drops in unemployment rate
but there more than one way to gauge the drop in unemployment
