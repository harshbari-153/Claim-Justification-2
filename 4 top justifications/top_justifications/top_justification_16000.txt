China’s developing country status in the World Trade Organization "means they can tariff and embargo."
scaramucci said china s status in the wto as a developing nation means they can tariff and embargo
we wondered if it was true that china s developing nation status in the wto empowers it to impose tariffs and embargoes
so that means they can tariff and embargo things scaramucci said may
a critical point is that both developed and developing nations alike can impose tariffs this right is not exclusive to developing nations
but developing countries typically do negotiate higher tariff caps than their developed counterparts
