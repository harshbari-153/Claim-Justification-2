"This bill allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure" before an abortion.
our ruling mcdonnell in a carefully worded statement said the bill he recently signed allows virginia to join about other states that have an ultrasound procedure before allowing abortions
but the governor in implying virginia has adopted a mainstream law on ultrasounds omitted a contradicting fact virginia will join only nine states that have passed mandatory ultrasound bills
this bill allows virginia to join about other states that have an ultrasound procedure said mcdonnell a republican
it is technically correct that states have passed legislation that at least requires women be offered information on how to get ultrasounds before abortions
guttmacher lists states with ultrasound laws including seven that mandate the test be performed before an abortion
