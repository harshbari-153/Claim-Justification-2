Joe Biden "already has what is the most progressive platform of any major party nominee in history."
is it accurate to say that biden already has what is the most progressive platform of any major party nominee in history
obama said that biden already has what is the most progressive platform of any major party nominee in history
there is a plausible case for biden as the most progressive democratic nominee in history
is joe biden s platform as progressive as obama says
it probably is true that this might well be the most progressive platform the democrats have had but that doesn t mean that biden will emphasize all of it
