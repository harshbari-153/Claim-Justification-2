"Singer Celine Dion Says: ‘I Can’t Even Look At An American Flag Any More, I Hate This Country.’"
an april headline falsely quoted dion as saying i can t even look at an american flag any more i hate this country
did celine dion say she hates this country no
the video shares the same title as the blog post but instead of dion speaking it s actually just a computer voiceover saying i can t even look at an american flag anymore i hate this country
canadian singer celine dion did not say she hates america despite a hoax you might have seen online
instead it talks about how dion turned down an offer to sing at president donald trump s inauguration
