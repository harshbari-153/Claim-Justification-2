Steve Poizner "increased his department's budget nearly 14 percent."
the charges about poizner stewardship of the department are similar but the particular ad we be checking tells viewers that poizner increased his department budget nearly percent
whitman accuses poizner of percent budget increase
one recurring theme in numerous whitman ads is that poizner presided over a big increase in the insurance department budget
and the budget after that was entirely poizner
the budget increase that occurred between and was entirley under garamendi control not poizner
