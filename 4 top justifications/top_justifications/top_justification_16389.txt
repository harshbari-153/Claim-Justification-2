"(Mary) Burkeâ€™s company," Trek Bicycles, "makes 99% of their bikes overseas."
walkers ad says that trek bicycle makes of their bikes overseas and it puts mary burke at the center of responsibility by saying trek is burke s company
the spot adds that burke s company makes almost all their bikes overseas
of the bicycles that burke s company produces are made overseas
she has said that trek as a company trying to compete globally does what it can to manufacture bikes in the united states and makes more bikes in america than any other manufacturer
but even if it was instead of the overseas production share would be percent which still sounds a lot like the walker ad s phrasing that almost all of trek s bikes are made outside the united states
