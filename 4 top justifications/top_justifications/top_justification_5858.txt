"If the House of Representatives fails to extend the middle-class tax cuts, 400,000 middle-class Rhode Island families will see their federal income taxes increase."
in a report tailored for rhode island the administration claims if the house of representatives fails to extend the tax cuts rhode island families will see their federal income taxes increase
in an attempt to give taxpayers a sense of the impact of not extending the cuts the obama administration has issued estimates of how many families would be affected if the cuts expire
but saying that the number of rhode island families to be affected is is a substantial exaggeration
the white house says million families across the united states would be affected
without an agreement on tax reform a lot of people are going to be affected
