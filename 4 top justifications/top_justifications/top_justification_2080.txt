"Before 1973 it was illegal in the U.S. to profit off of health care."
did you know that before it was illegal in the us to profit off health care the post states
but while health care did go from a mostly nonprofit venture to one that was more lucrative as a result of the law it s an overstatement to say was illegal prior to the nixon era
no it was not illegal to profit off healthcare before a law
an internet post about the commercialization of american health care misread history by claiming it was illegal for companies to turn a profit until president richard nixon signed a law that opened the floodgates
in short it was legal to profit off health care before the act but there s an important wrinkle to the legal dimension
