Say Matt Wand cut Troutdale police, created a slush fund for himself.
house democrats say matt wand cut police voted for slush fund
so we had to check it out when we spotted a recent campaign mailer that said this matt wand cut the police force while creating a slush fund for his own expenses
also she sent minutes from an april troutdale city council work session as evidence that wand approved a slush fund
it s inaccurate to say that he selfishly created a slush fund for his own expenses when he didn t
separately he worked hard to protect his own pocketbook by supporting an expense slush fund for himself
