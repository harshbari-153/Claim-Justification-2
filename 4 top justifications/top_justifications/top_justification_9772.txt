Says that while his plan would narrow the time for early voting, "it still will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America."
he said if his plan were put in place the voting window will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in america
husted said under his plan it still will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in america according to a report from gongwer news service a paid information service
while it may be a fair point about comparing voting states with those without easy access to absentee ballots we return to husted s words which were that ohio would still have one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in america
put another way only states that allow early voting statewide would have shorter periods than ohio to vote early
but that hasn t stopped critics of the republican s plan from pointing out that husted s proposal to change ohio s election laws would narrow the time during which voters can cast ballots through early voting as well as reduce the days in which to request absentee ballots
