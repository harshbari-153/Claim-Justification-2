Eighty-five percent of Floridians who will benefit from expanding Medicaid are "single, childless adults."
weatherford says percent of people covered by medicaid expansion are single childless adults
we wondered what other experts know about the percentage of childless adults again we ca measure childless and single who could get medicaid coverage under an expansion
duffy said percent of those who would receive medicaid as part of the expansion would be childless adults
the percent figure weatherford cited for single childless adults was actually an estimate of all adults who would be covered if medicaid expanded
that makes sense because childless adults currently can not receive medicaid under any circumstances in florida
