The Biden administration "gifted the Taliban with $80 billion-plus" in military-grade weapons but now "wants your 9mm pistols."
a viral image says the biden administration gifted the taliban with in weapons and wants your pistols
the current regime that just gifted the taliban with billion worth of military grade weapons wants your pistols a viral image claims
no proof biden left taliban in weapons or that he wants americans pistols
a popular take on facebook is that the biden administration with its withdrawal from afghanistan in effect armed the taliban and yet wants to take handguns away from americans
as for the second part of the claim which suggests biden wants to confiscate pistols during the presidential campaign we rated false a statement by the nra that biden wants to ban pistols
