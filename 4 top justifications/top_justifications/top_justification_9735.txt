"N95 masks block few, if any" COVID-19 particles due to their size.
a facebook post said the masks block few if any particles due to their size
so masks block few if any virions virus particles
covid virus particle size is nanometers
claim that masks can t stop particles due to size is nonsense
masks actually have that name because they are efficient at stopping particles in their least efficient particle size range in this case those around
