"McDonaldâ€™s puts aborted baby fetuses in their food."
mcdonald s puts aborted baby fetuses in their food this is not fake a man can be heard saying
no mcdonald s doesn t put aborted baby fetuses in its food
mcdonald s does not use aborted human fetuses in its food
rather we discovered a by snopes which debunked a claim that a mcdonald s in alabama had been outed for using aborted fetuses in its chicken mcnuggets and an undated response from mcdonald s on the company s website to a question posed by someone named muhannad are you using human s meat in the food
we looked for credible reports of aborted fetuses or aborted fetus cells in mcdonald s food and found none
