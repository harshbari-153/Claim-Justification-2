Says that when President Obama visited El Paso, he "pronounced that the border with Mexico and the United States was safer than it ever was in history."
obama did not actually pronounce that the border with mexico and the united states was safer than it ever was in history
so did obama actually say the border with mexico and the united states is now safer than it ever way in history let review obama words he said there is more border enforcement than ever they wanted more agents at the border
border with mexico perry challenged president barack obama s claim about its safety we got a president of the united states who came to el paso some weeks ago and pronounced that the border with mexico and the united states was safer than it ever was in history
he said el paso and other border cities are safe compared with other u
still obama tone and his examples definitely supported the overall point that the border is safer now than it was before
