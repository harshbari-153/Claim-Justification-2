Says a Portland school gives Muslim students "their own school provided prayer room, prayer rugs," and lets them "out of class five times a day to pray to Allah."
in her missive taft writes that muslim students at portland rigler elementary school are given their own school provided prayer room prayer rugs helpfully stored in the prayer room by the school and let out of class five times a day to pray to allah
here another sentence along those lines the school stores the muslim prayer rugs for the students in a special room and they roll them all out for the kids five times a day
one claim that caught our attention straight away it did seem right that muslim students would be praying five times during the school day
she said that the students were praying five times a day instead of once that the school let them out of class it was during lunch that the school gave them a prayer room it was an unused office and prayer rugs nope and that other religions would not be similarly accommodated they are
it true some muslims pray five times a day but most of those prayers do fall during the school day
