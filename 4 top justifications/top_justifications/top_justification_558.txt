A waiver in the American Health Care Act "doesnâ€™t apply to things like maternity coverage."
faso said a waiver in the american health care act doesn t apply to things like maternity coverage
the waiver applies specifically to maternity coverage
if a state does not require maternity coverage and is approved for a waiver insurers there would not be required to cover maternity care
it doesn t apply to things like maternity coverage
if a state only waives the requirement that plans offer maternity coverage then it s unlikely any plan would voluntarily offer maternity coverage said cynthia cox associate director for health reform and private insurance at the kaiser family foundation
