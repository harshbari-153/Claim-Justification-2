"Do you know which state has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African-American voter turnout? Massachusetts. Do you know what has the best, where African-American turnout actually exceeds white turnout? Mississippi."
our ruling roberts said do you know which state has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to voter turnout massachusetts
do you know what has the best where turnout actually exceeds white turnout mississippi
do you know what has the best where turnout actually exceeds white turnout mississippi
roberts asked verrilli do you know which state has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to voter turnout verrilli who was defending the law as currently written responded i do not
however roberts makes a valid point when he notes that black voter turnout in mississippi and other deep south states is high and indeed often exceeds white turnout
