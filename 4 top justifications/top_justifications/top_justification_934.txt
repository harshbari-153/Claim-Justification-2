The COVID-19 vaccines cause AIDS.
a facebook post claims that the vaccines cause aids
only hiv causes aids and the vaccines don t contain hiv
no the vaccines do not cause aids
data from clinical trials do not show that the vaccines create any increased risk for aids nor is there evidence that those infected with hiv are more likely to develop aids after receiving one of the vaccines
medical experts say the vaccines do not make people more susceptible to hiv or aids and that the shots bolster the immune system
