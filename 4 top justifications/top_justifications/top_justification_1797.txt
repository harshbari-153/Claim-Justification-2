"Job growth and stock growth for the first two years of Trump are down from where they were (during the) last two years of Obama."
so job growth and stock growth for first two years of trump are down from where they were last two years of obama
so job growth and stock growth for the first two years of trump are down from where they were during the last two years of obama dowd tweeted on march
dowd tweeted job growth and stock growth for the first two years of trump are down from where they were during the last two years of obama
but how about dowd s assertion that job growth and stock growth for the first two years of trump are down from where they were during the last two years of obama there he s on shakier ground
but he s wrong about the stock market which increased by a larger percentage during trump s first two years than in obama s final two
