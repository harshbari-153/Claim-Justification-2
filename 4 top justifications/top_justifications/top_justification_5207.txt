Since he and Scott Walker took office in 2011, "60,000 new jobs have been created in this state -- 40,000 of them were created in Madison and the Madison area."
soglin says that since he and walker took office in new jobs have been created in this state of them were created in madison and the madison area
and he suggested madison is responsible for most new jobs in the state saying
and if you look at the madison tax rolls if you look at the population growth if you look at the fact that when governor walker and i both took office in within three months of one another new jobs have been created in this state of them were created in madison and the madison area
we wondered whether the figure was accurate and whether madison and the surrounding area created of the new jobs in wisconsin over the past seven years
so the madison area produced far less than of the new jobs
