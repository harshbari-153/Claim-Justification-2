"The CDC issued its first warning on Jan 8. Trump held campaign rallies on Jan 9, Jan 14, Jan 28, Jan 30, Feb 10, Feb 19, Feb 20, Feb 21, & Feb 28. He golfed on Jan 18, Jan 19, Feb 1, Feb 15, Mar 7, Mar 8. The first time he admitted the coronavirus might be a problem was Mar 13."
while the golf and rally dates are accurate the dates of the cdc s first warning and trump s response to the coronavirus aren t as clear cut
the dates when the cdc first warned the public about and when trump admitted the coronavirus might be a problem are more ambiguous
viral post compares dates on when trump admitted coronavirus was a problem
the post lists specific dates saying trump held campaign rallies on jan jan jan jan feb feb feb feb feb
but that trump continued to hold campaign rallies and play golf before he admitted the coronavirus might be a problem on march
