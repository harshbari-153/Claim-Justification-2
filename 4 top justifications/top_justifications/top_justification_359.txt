Says, "In the last four years weâ€™ve cut $36 million in ongoing revenue."
election in the last four years we ve cut million in ongoing revenue
he stated million in ongoing cuts
in other words today s budget is not million less than the budget which is what the average person probably thinks when the mayor says that he has cut million in ongoing revenue
so we wanted to know more about these dollar cuts
we ve called out politicians previously for talking about budget cuts when government has had more money than the year before just not enough to cover a shortfall and pay for new programs
