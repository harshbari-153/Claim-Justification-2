Says Josh Mandel opposed federal loans to the auto industry.
sherrod brown campaign says josh mandel opposes the auto industry rescue
so politifact ohio was surprised recently when brown s campaign began asserting that mandel would have voted against the federal loans to rescue automakers chrysler and general motors
nowhere in the story is he quoted as saying he would have voted against the loans as a senator
did mandel oppose the allocation of tarp funds to the automakers mandel did not answer the question directly
mandel often refuses to offer clear opinions on key issues before congress be it the violence against women act or a bill to keep interest rates from doubling on student loans
