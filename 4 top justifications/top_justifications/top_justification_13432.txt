voting in the wrong precinct led to over registered voters statewide to lose their vote in state sen nina turner a cleveland democrat said during a floor speech on june
for example one provision added by the ohio house barred poll workers from helping voters find their correct precinct for voting if they end up in the wrong place
in the november election ballots from more than registered voters weren t counted because they were cast in the wrong place
that s important because casting a ballot in the wrong place means your vote doesn t count
but the second most common reason the ballot was not counted was because while the person was properly registered to vote in ohio they cast the ballot in the wrong county or precinct
