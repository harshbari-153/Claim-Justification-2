"I'm self-funding my own campaign."
trump said i my own campaign
in contrast trump said i my own campaign
nor do i think a candidate who loans money to his campaign but who expects to be paid back by the campaign is fairly characterized as
one critique of fundraising it makes you spend a lot of time around very rich people and trump clearly already does that skinner said
but he does have a point that he puts up a lot of his own money especially compared with other candidates and that donors are largely staying away
