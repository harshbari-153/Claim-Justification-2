Says the Nike bill "is not a tax break ... this does not lower the taxes that Nike will pay nor does it prevent the Legislature from raising those taxes in the future."
that s true the bill does not reduce nike s tax burden
this does not lower the taxes that nike will pay nor does it prevent the legislature from raising those taxes in the future
does the new nike bill qualify as a tax break
but it s been clear all along that the governor would use the legislation to ensure the continuance of a sizable tax giveaway for nike
so as the governor was testifying on a bill that would allow him to guarantee nike up to three decades of a single sales tax factor he tried to be very clear about what it represented
