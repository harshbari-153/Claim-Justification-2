Increasing the bottle deposit to 10 cents on a case of water bottles could literally double the price of that product in the store.
i m hung up on the fee increase he said in his floor speech later adding the deposit going from to cents for instance on a case of water bottles could literally double the price of that product in the store
but could a nickel increase really double the price of a set of water bottles a quick check at a downtown portland safeway showed these prices for a case of water bottles
matt wingard says price of certain beverages could double under increased bottle deposits
and the bottle bill deposit is per container not per size of said container so the more containers the more deposits refundable of course
yes taken narrowly the cost of a case of water could nearly double
