"As Governor, Wolf has already proposed more than $8B in tax increases."
as governor wolf has already proposed more than in tax increases
billion number as the estimate for wolf s tax increase requests during his time in office
billion in tax increases during wolf s time in office
what s changed however is mango s estimate for wolf s proposed tax increases from billion to more than billion during the governor s time in office
hypothetically if wolf s requests for tax increases would have been granted during the first year there would be no deficit today and therefore no need to increase taxes
