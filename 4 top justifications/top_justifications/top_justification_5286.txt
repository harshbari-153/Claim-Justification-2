"None of the polls being conducted right now have us on the top line. None of them. It's always Trump and Clinton and then second question, third question. ... If we were included in the top line, as Johnson/Trump/Clinton, we'd be at 20 percent."
none of the polls being conducted right now have us on the top line
based on this list we can say that johnson is certainly wrong that every poll asks about clinton and trump before adding his name in a later question
eleven of the polls we looked at close to half included johnson in their first or only question about the presidential
it always trump and clinton and then second question third question well what if you add johnson told cnbc on august
in a couple of other cases johnson specified how well he thinks he d be doing if he were listed as an option in pollsters first question percent more than enough to qualify for the debates
