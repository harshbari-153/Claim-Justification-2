Says U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn was "handpicked" by President Barack Obama
implicit in perdue s effort to link nunn with obama is the often repeated charge that nunn will be a rubber stamp for the president if she is elected
there is no doubt that barack obama and his allies picked michelle nunn to be the democrat nominee and attempted to influence the outcome of the primary election on her behalf dickey said
obama handpicked her
but nunn s stated opposition to some of obama s key policies supports the idea that she would not be a rubber stamp for the president
since then the president has told an atlanta radio station that a nunn victory in the race means that democrats keep control of the senate and his wife michelle obama headlined a for nunn
