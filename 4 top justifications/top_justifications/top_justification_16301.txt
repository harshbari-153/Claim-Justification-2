"We are one of the most expensive [bus] rides in New England."
we are one of the most expensive rides in new england odimgbe told the board members during the meeting
transit ceo says rhode island bus fares are among most expensive in new england
so odimgbe s claim that ripta is one of the most expensive rides in new england is true for base fares but not when it comes to longer trips
so what have we learned during our ride when we confined our comparison to new england just as odimgbe stated we could not find another bus system charging as much as ripta s base fare
if you did look to boston or new york for a comparison and took into consideration their higher cost of living you will come to the conclusion that the rides in rhode island are very high he said
