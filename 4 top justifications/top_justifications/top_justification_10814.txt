"The 550 U.S. billionaires together are worth $2.5 trillion. If we confiscated 100% of their wealth, we'd raise enough to run the federal government for less than eight months."
the two figures are out of date but the thrust of the claim is accurate the estimated trillion in wealth of the nation s billionaires is enough to cover about eight months worth of federal spending
if we confiscated of their wealth we raise enough to run the federal government for less than eight months
tapping the billionaires trillion would pay for about days of federal government spending or more than eight months
if we confiscated of their wealth we raise enough to run the federal government for less than months
confiscating us billionaires wealth would run the us government about months
