our ruling lautenberg said that because of hurricane sandy in atlantic city much of that boardwalk no longer the pillars where the boardwalk used to be
but for communities like belmar seaside heights the atlantic city and others much of that boardwalk no longer exists just the pillars where the boardwalk used to be as we see it here lautenberg said as he showed a photograph of damage to a section of boardwalk in atlantic city
it is factually accurate that a portion of the boardwalk was destroyed by sandy said jeff guaracino chief communications and strategy officer for atlantic city alliance but it s not the boardwalk that the average person would typically associate with a visit to atlantic city
frank lautenberg says after hurricane sandy much of the boardwalk in atlantic city no longer exists
