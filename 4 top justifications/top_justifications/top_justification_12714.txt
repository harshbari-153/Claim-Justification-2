Says Tony Evers will "raise the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon."
good thing you re filling up because if tony evers wins he ll raise the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon
tony evers is open to raising gas tax but scott walker is the one saying it would be per gallon
so saying evers will raise gas taxes by up to per gallon when he has only said he would consider raising the tax some amount goes too far
walker says evers will raise the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon
state gas tax because evers had said how much he would be willing to increase it
