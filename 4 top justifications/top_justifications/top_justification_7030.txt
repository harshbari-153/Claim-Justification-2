"Americans admire Glenn Beck more than they admire the pope."
it official americans admire glenn beck more than they admire the pope milbank wrote
milbank says americans admire glenn beck more than they do the pope
using this poll newport told politifact i think it not accurate for example to say that beck is more admired than the pope
but beck earned a few more mentions than the pope enough by gallup reckoning to edge his holiness by a nose
a better way to compare the two men newport said would be to ask respondents directly whether they admired beck and whether they admired the pope
