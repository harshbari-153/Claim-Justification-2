buttigieg s military background is part of his argument for becoming commander in chief
the origin of the photo of buttigieg in a uniform without military insignia appears to be a blog post about a column buttigieg wrote for the south bend tribune

the conspiracy that buttigieg faked his military experience appears to have originated on a fringe forum where users post anonymously
this guy is a fraud
