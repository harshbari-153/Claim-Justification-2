The cityâ€™s 30 percent set aside for affordable housing in urban renewal areas is calculated citywide -- not district by district
portland mayor sam adams says that affordable housing is calculated citywide not district by district
it would also drive down the amount of money being spent on affordable housing in the oregon convention center urban renewal district which includes the coliseum to percent percentage points short of the city s previously planned percent
the concept of setting aside a certain amount for affordable housing stretches back to a resolution passed by the portland city council on april
that resolution in part committed the council to establishing a policy to dedicate a percentage of tax increment financing tif revenues from all urban renewal districts citywide to an affordable housing set aside fund
we knew that some districts would be more conducive better cost benefit for subsidizing affordable housing expenditures and others would be less
