"Trump refuses to denounce the KKK."
narrator trump refuses to denounce the kkk
but it s a stretch to say trump refuses to denounce the kkk given his record of denouncements before and after the tapper interview
a super pac said trump refuses to denounce the kkk
although trump disavowed duke and the kkk in the past his criticism has been less pointed in
trump hasn t gone after the kkk and white nationalists like duke with the same fervor as his opponents but it s inaccurate to make a blanket statement based on a single interview given his history of rejecting white supremacists
