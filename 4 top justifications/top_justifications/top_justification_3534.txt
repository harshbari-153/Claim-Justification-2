Thirteen Democratic senators "voted against cheaper medicines" and took millions from "big pharma since 2011."
the viral image says that democratic senators voted against cheaper medicines and took millions from big pharma since
the assertion that these senators took millions from big pharma since is also imprecise
a viral post circulating recently in some of the more liberal corners of social media accuses democratic senators of allegedly voting against lower drug prices because they were recipients of big money from drugmakers
the democrats did vote against one amendment that was intended to lower drug prices through reimportation of medicines from canada and they have each taken money from drugmakers
however the image leaves a misleading impression that the senators have voted against lowering drug prices
