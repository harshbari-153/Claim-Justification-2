our ruling ratliff wrote that massachusetts has three mandated student tests and finland one
updated thomas ratliff says massachusetts imposes three mandatory student tests finland just one
but students on the academic track in finland must take at least four separate tests
also given that ratliff s article does not say he s speaking only to tests administered in high school it s worth noting that massachusetts like texas requires students starting in third grade to take state tests
austin thomas ratliff pleasant said massachusetts the envy of all public school systems in the united states has three tests
