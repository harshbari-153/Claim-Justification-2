Says Cresent Hardy agreed with Mitt Romney "about the 47 percent" and said that "people with disabilities are, and I quote him, ‘a drain on society.’ "
hardy who says that mitt romney was right about the percent and that people with disabilities are and i quote him a drain on society
but clinton s line makes it appear that hardy is directly saying that people with disabilities are a drain on society which certainly isn t the case as he never directly states that
but clinton s claim becomes much more convoluted over hardy s comments on people with disabilities
and it does seem that hardy is insinuating having a disability might cause them to be a drain on society but his wording is unclear enough to pin down what he exactly means
clinton is spot on in linking hardy and romney on the percent comments yet she s off in criticizing him over supposed comments on people with disabilities
