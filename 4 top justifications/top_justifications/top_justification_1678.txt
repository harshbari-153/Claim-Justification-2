but is it true that ross supports the iran nuclear deal and the ransom it paid for hostages like the ad claims
a new ad attacking richard burr s challenger deborah ross says ross supports the iran nuclear deal and the ransom it paid for hostages

ross does say she supports the nuclear deal although she adds a caveat
