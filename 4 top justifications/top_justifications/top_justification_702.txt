The Koch Brothers are "spending more money than either the Democratic or Republican parties" in the 2016 elections.
sanders said one family the koch brothers will spend more than either major political party in the campaign
sanders says koch brothers are outspending either political party in elections
in either case the kochs made it clear that most of the money would not come from their own pockets but from a political network of anonymous contributors
so anyway you dice it it does not appear that the koch brothers will outspend either one of the major political parties in next year s elections
he sent us a link to the two political parties spending during the most recent presidential campaign and reports about projected spending for the koch brothers political network leading up to the election
