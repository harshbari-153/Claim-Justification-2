"There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation."
but on the afternoon of march stupak said in a news conference that the promise of an executive order on abortion from president barack obama convinced him there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation
we think that enough to back up stupak claim there will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation
the senate bill states very clearly that public funding through tax credits and government subsidies for elective abortion services offered in the exchange is prohibited
so what changed on sunday that prompted stupak to say there will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation in the hours leading up to the vote he and several other antiabortion democrats in the house agreed to back the health bill after obama promised to sign an executive order reinforcing the commitment that no federal funds would be used for abortions
for weeks stupak insisted he and a group of other abortion foes in the house could not support the senate bill because it would result in federal funding of abortions contrary to longstanding federal policy
