steve king says maxine waters wins election with fewer votes because of lower turnout
remember that king said he needed votes to win and waters needed only to to win
in presidential years winning half the votes in waters district takes much more than that
we thought we d check whether king a republican from northwestern iowa was right when he said that waters a democrat who represents a los district typically wins her seat in congress with fewer votes than he does because of lower turnout and a higher illegal immigrant population
