"There was no real scientific basis for believing that" social distancing would be necessary, "since it had never been studied."
ingraham said there was no real scientific basis for believing that social distancing would be necessary since it had never been studied
although intuitively i think it probably seemed like social distancing would be necessary there was no real scientific basis for believing that since it had never been studied ingraham said
to say that there was no scientific basis for believing that is like saying there is no scientific basis for epidemiology he said
there s plenty of science behind social distancing
laura ingraham wrong about real scientific basis for social distancing
