"We are within the margin of error."
but we are within the margin of error my friends
we can say for certain that another method the media commonly use saying a race is within the margin of error only if the gap between the candidates is smaller than the margin of error is wrong
percent margin of error
research kos had obama up with a margin of error just within the margin of error
percentage points also outside the margin of error
