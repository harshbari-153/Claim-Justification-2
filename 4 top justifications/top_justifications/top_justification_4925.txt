trump said taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of air force one on the campaign trail by obama and clinton
technically if the president makes a campaign trip the campaign or the political party is supposed to reimburse the government for use of the plane to some degree
we wondered if it was true that the trip was going to be made at taxpayer expense
but based on the information available it clear that the campaign is only going to be picking up a small fraction of the hourly costs of using the plane with taxpayers footing the bill for the rest
