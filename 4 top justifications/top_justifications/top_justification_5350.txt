Says electric utilities "are trying to fool you into amending your state Constitution in a way that gives them the authority to shut down net metering."
gore said electric utilities are trying to fool you into amending your state constitution in a way that gives them the authority to shut down net metering
but they are trying to fool you into amending your state constitution in a way that gives them the authority to shut down net metering and do in florida what they did in nevada and just kill the solar industry
does amendment allow utility companies to stop net metering and what is net metering anyway we wanted to shine some light on a very contentious energy proposal
the amendment is widely considered to be deceptively worded and erects barriers to solar power that would favor traditional utilities
amendment opponents therefore fear that utilities will lobby the state to allow a surcharge on solar customers or as gore said change the policy for net metering
