"The president went on a stimulus-fueled spending binge that stuck every American man, woman and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion debt."
instead of working to cut the deficit the ohio republican said the president went on a spending binge that stuck every american man woman and child with a share of this trillion national debt
but his claim stated that as a result of a presidential spending binge every american man woman and child was stuck with a share of the trillion debt
does spending under obama break down to a share of the national debt we asked boehner office for more information
they responded that the speaker has often talked about president obama s spending binge and called it a reference to his entire approach to economic policy not just one bill
finally many americans associate obama with the legislative activities of his first year or two when initiatives such as the american recovery and reinvestment act commonly called the stimulus sent spending upward the fastest
