scarborough said that clinton sent a memo to state department staff that said they should not use personal email accounts for department business
scarborough also summarized the memo as saying you should not do state department business on personal email
scarborough clinton told state department staff not to use personal email for official business
as a point of reference we don t know if the state department had signed off on the private server that carried clinton s emails she didn t use gmail or yahoo or another commercial provider or if the server met government security standards
clinton was secretary of state before there was a law that would have required her to use a government email address or share copies of her communications with the government
