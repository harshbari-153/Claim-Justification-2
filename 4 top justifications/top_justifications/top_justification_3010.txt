Says the state of Maryland issued these Independence Day 2020 safety guidelines.
a faux notice about independence day safety guidelines supposedly issued by the maryland state government has some marylanders pretty angry
we found no official safety guidelines for july on the maryland state government website
maryland july safety guidelines poster is fake
and the maryland state fire marshal released a june statement saying this notice is indeed fake
even though the poster includes an image of the maryland state seal it seems to have nothing to do with the state of maryland
