"In 40 years of broadcast, I have never endorsed any candidate."
but let me tell you in years of broadcast i have never endorsed any candidate
and i haven t endorsed any candidate mainly because for a lot of those years nobody really wanted my endorsement beck said with a laugh
glenn beck says before ted cruz he never endorsed a candidate for office
and quite honestly i have never endorsed anybody because i haven t trusted any of the weasels no matter how good they are
beck declared in iowa he hadn t previously endorsed a candidate
