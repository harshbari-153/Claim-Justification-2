"Why did the state do that with COVID patients in nursing homes? It’s because the state followed President Trump’s CDC guidance."
i m not going to get into the political back and forth but anyone who wants to ask why did the state do that with covid patients in nursing homes it s because the state followed president trump s cdc guidance cuomo said
to support cuomo s claim the administration pointed us to longstanding state and federal regulations that predate the pandemic which require nursing homes to only accept patients for which they can care
new york s nursing home policy was not fully in line with cdc
is cuomo correct we looked at federal guidance at the time of the state march order as well as other state health department actions at that time
on april after the state policy had been under intense scrutiny zucker wrote a letter to nursing homes telling them to alert the state if they have patients for which they can not care
