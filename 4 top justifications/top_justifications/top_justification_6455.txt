"Here in Wisconsin, we've put in previous budgets more money into mental health services than any governor has in the last 25 years."
walker said here in wisconsin we put in previous budgets more money into mental health services than any governor has in the last years
that s why i m proud that here in wisconsin we ve put in previous budgets more money into mental health services than any governor has in the last years
so let s see whether walker put into the state budget more money for mental health than any governor in the last
scott walker says he put more funds into mental health than any wisconsin governor in years
but on putting state money into the state budget for mental health he is correct
