Says U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde has ‘no problem with raising taxes.’
in a national tv interview hovde said he had no problem with raising taxes the ad says
club for growth says hovde has no problem with raising taxes
so did hovde s remarks suggest he has no problem with raising taxes we watched the nearly discussion between hovde and the cable show s hosts and found a brief exchange on taxes that closely but not exactly mirrors the language in the group s ad
so hovde has made it clear he is against raising tax rates
that doesn t square with the breezy portrayal of hovde as having no problem raising taxes
