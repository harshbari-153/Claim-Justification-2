"They tried to give us $400 million to build a high-speed train that goes 39 miles an hour."
they tried to give us million to build a train that goes miles an hour kasich told cnn reporter john king during a television interview on nov
and it comes with a million check from the federal government enough to get the train up and running by late supporters say
you know i think that toy train goes faster than the mph train kasich said
but most of kasich s criticism about the passenger train has targeted its projected speed
he was being sarcastic yes but sticking to an underlying point that the proposed passenger train would travel too slowly for anyone to actually want to ride on it
