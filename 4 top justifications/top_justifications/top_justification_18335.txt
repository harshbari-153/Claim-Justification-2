"We have $60 billion in 2010 in Medicare fraud."
we have people that are gaming the system we have billion in in medicare fraud
many media outlets and critics of government health care programs have used that billion figure when describing the extent of medicare fraud
our ruling brendan doherty said there was billion in medicare fraud in
it did not come up with a specific figure for medicare but if we use its percent estimate then medicare fraud would have amounted to about billion in a quarter of doherty s figure
if medicare fraud were as high as percent it would have totaled about billion in still less than doherty s estimate
