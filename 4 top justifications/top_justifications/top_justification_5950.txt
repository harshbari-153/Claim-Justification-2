"James Comey has 50 counts of TREASON. And John Brennan has 48 counts of TREASON."
and john brennan has counts of treason
that s what a recent facebook post alleges without any evidence i m hearing that james comey has counts of treason the post says
no james comey and john brennan haven t been charged with multiple counts of treason
but neither comey nor brennan have been charged with treason
on the most basic level treason has to occur in wartime or during an armed rebellion against the government
