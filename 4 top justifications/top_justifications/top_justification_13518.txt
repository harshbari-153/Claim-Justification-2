"I can't sign money. That's illegal."
that illegal clinton said according to a cbs news video of the exchange
i ca sign money
and so we find that although clinton statement has a germ of truth because defacing dollars is illegal she is wrong about an innocent autograph
in this case it a question of whether an autograph is a deliberate attempt to deface a bill so it ca be used again
this practice is not considered as defacement since the autographs are generally provided to persons as keepsakes as opposed to circulating currency
