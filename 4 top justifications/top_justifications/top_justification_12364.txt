Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson "led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution and took nearly $225,000 from polluters."
both make variations of the same claim that ron johnson led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution
the league of conservation voters launched tv ads that claim johnson led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution and took nearly from polluters
environmental group claims ron johnson voted against carbon limits took cash from polluters
we checked a similar claim in when the league of conservation voters aired an ad that said johnson had taken more than from oil and gas and voted to let them keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air
johnson voted twice to prohibit the epa from regulating any carbon emissions
