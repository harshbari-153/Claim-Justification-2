Jeff Weems' "legal record is one of defending BP, Enron and just about every big oil company against the working man."
porter consultant corbin casteel said in a july press release weems claims to represent the working man yet his legal record is one of defending bp enron and just about every big oil company against the working man
as far as bp an april bloomberg news article calls weems an oil and gas lawyer who has represented bp in texas courts
david porter says democrat jeff weems has record of lawyering for bp enron and big oil companies
weems an oil and gas lawyer has represented numerous energy companies including bp and enron the latter almost years ago
however porter saying weems has represented just about every big oil company is a stretch on weems actual legal record
