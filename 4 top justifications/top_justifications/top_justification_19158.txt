"There's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is genetic."
so where does this leave us pawlenty said there no scientific conclusion that being gay is genetic
tim pawlenty says there no scientific conclusion that being gay is genetic

but if being gay is not primarily determined by genes it doesn t mean that its origin isn t biological
