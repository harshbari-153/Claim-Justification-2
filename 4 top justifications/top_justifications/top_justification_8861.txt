A telephone company will no longer have to provide landline service to customers if there is an alternative provider, including wireless.
one was a change that would allow phone companies to refuse to not run new landlines to homes and businesses if there is an adequate alternative that the customer could use such as cell phone service
the new rules say a company can only decline to provide landline service if there is a reasonably adequate alternative
it says that a telephone company shall not have the duty to extend or expand its facilities to furnish service and facilities when the person firm or corporation has service available from one or more alternative providers of wireline or terrestrial wireless communications services at prevailing market rates
ward armstrong says a telecom bill would allow phone companies to refuse laying landlines for new customers
the bill would require landline providers to give any existing customer the option to have a landline repaired if service is disrupted
