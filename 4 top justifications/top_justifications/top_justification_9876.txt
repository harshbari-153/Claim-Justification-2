"The Governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his [transportation] plan."
armstrong wrote the governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his plan
on monday we learned that the governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his plan to borrow billion and take another billion out of the general fund to pay for transportation armstrong wrote
armstrong seemed to take it one step further by saying the governor did not consult members of his own party before releasing the plan
it s accurate the governor did not collectively brief the lawmakers who belong to either the house or senate republican caucus
it would seem remarkable if the governor hadn t consulted with fellow republicans before trotting out the plan so we thought we d look into that
