john mccain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down american troops

biden is right that mccain opposed a war spending bill
and biden is correct that mccain voted against the bill when it included that requirement
mccain said he opposed the bill because it had been loaded with political pork and because it required a withdrawal regardless of conditions in iraq
