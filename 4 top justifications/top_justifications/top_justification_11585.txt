A second impeachment means Donald Trump loses his lifetime pension, travel allowance, Secret Service detail, and his ability to run for public office.
a facebook post says that if trump is impeached again he will lose his lifetime pension travel allowance secret service detail and his ability to run for public office
trump could lose his ability to run for office after he leaves the white house but it would not happen solely as a result of impeachment
but impeachment alone even the second in trump s presidency wouldn t disqualify trump from receiving some benefits
if the house votes to impeach trump the senate would have to convict him while he s still in office in order to revoke his lifetime pension and travel allowance
if the house votes to impeach trump he would not automatically lose his perks of the senate would have to vote to convict and remove trump
