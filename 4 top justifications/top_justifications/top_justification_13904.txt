Philadelphia Eagles players stayed "in the Locker Room for the playing of our our National Anthem" or were "kneeling."
under the new rule players would still be able to wait in the locker room during the anthem
president trump said eagles players kneeled for the anthem they didn t
we found no reports that said players stayed in the locker room
but here s the thing none of the eagles kneeled during the national anthem in
why in part because only a small number of players decided to come and in part because trump said that players had been kneeling or standing in the locker room during the national anthem which he said was disrespectful
