The Biden administration is attempting "to criminalize free speech."
some are using that february document to falsely claim that president joe biden is trying to criminalize free speech
but the post s assertion that this shows the biden administration is trying to criminalize speech is wrong on two counts he said
the biden administration has multiple times expressed its intent to protect free speech in other documents related to the role of misinformation in domestic extremism
but simply drawing attention to online misinformation does not constitute an attempt to criminalize free speech and nowhere in the document does the administration advocate for a policy that would criminalize it
blackburn exposed the biden admin s attempt to criminalize free speech
