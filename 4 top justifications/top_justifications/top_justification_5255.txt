Postmaster General Louis DeJoy "gave $400,000 to Republicans just this year" and has "between $30 and $75 million in assets of direct competitors to the United States Postal Service."
in an ad really american said dejoy gave to republicans just this year and has between and million in assets of direct competitors to the united states postal service
coincidentally dejoy and his wife have between and million in assets of direct competitors to the united states postal service
we found that the postmaster general has donated more than to republican causes in
ad watch is the postmaster general a republican donor with investments in usps competitors
but is the postmaster general also a republican donor as the pac claims
