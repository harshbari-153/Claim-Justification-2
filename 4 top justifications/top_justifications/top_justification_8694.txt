"In 2010, Mr. [Anthony] Gemma described himself as a 'pro-life' candidate. Now, he claims to be pro-choice."
part of their response we remain skeptical of anthony gemma sudden jump to support a woman right to choose while labeling himself as a candidate
our ruling naral america said in anthony gemma described himself as a candidate
and in a july news release with the headline anthony gemma outlines women s health care he will defend a woman s right to choose gemma said the issue of family planning choices is something i personally wrestle with everyday
spokesman alex morash acknowledged that gemma position had evolved because the candidate has become more understanding of other people beliefs
when naral says gemma has gone from being a candidate to calling himself a one we judge that statement to be true
