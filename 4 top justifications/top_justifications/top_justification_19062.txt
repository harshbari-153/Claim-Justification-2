Says he'sÂ so bipartisan that "12 of my bills were signed into law by Democratic President Bill Clinton."
did the republican really get of his bills signed by a democratic president the short answer it depends on how you count bills
he also sponsored two additional bills that got folded into a big government spending bill that clinton signed
i often joke in front of republican crowds and probably people are a little nervous by the fact that of my bills were signed by president clinton portman said
so here s the question we faced in reviewing portman s claim did of his bills actually become freestanding laws signed by clinton no
but it s unfair to stop there because portman sponsored another dozen bills that were folded into other legislation that congress passed and clinton signed
