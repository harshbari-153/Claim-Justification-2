Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker turned a $1 billion surplus into a $2.2 billion budget deficit.
trump walker turned a billion surplus into a budget shortfall
in january the nonpartisan legislative fiscal bureau projected wisconsin would see a surplus of about billion by june the end of the budget cycle
walker and the legislature adopted a series of tax cuts later in making good on a walker promise to return such surpluses to taxpayers but drawing criticism for not using the money for other purposes such as boosting the state s rainy day fund
trump fired back that walker had ruined his state s budget
but the shortfall was never a deficit and some of the surplus was consciously spent by republicans as tax cuts
