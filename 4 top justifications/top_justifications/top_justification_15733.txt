"We have 50 state lobbyists that just lobby the Legislature for money every year."
and for example we have state lobbyists that just lobby the legislature for money every year
in a national television interview republican gubernatorial candidate rick scott said that florida has state lobbyists that just lobby the legislature for money every year
even have lobbyists
we were intrigued by scott specific example of government excess his claim about the state lobbyists who just lobby the legislature for money every year
but as we looked at the list many of the state employees are lobbyists in the traditional sense meaning that they only lobby the legislature
