"Eight of the nine justices in the Supreme Court decision (on campaign finance) said that not only is it constitutional for Congress to require disclosure of the special interest money, but they recommend we do it."
eight of the nine justices in the supreme court decision said that not only is it constitutional for congress to require disclosure of the special interest money but they recommended we do it said schumer in a press conference shortly before the failed cloture vote on tuesday july
we were curious whether eight out of nine justices had really spoken so highly of disclosure requirements and if they had in fact recommended that congress require disclosure
so eight out of nine justices indicated that certain types of disclosure are constitutional
but did they recommend that congress require disclosure the supreme court typically does recommend that congress pass a law and this case is no exception
when it comes to disclosure eight justices seem to agree that disclosure is a good thing
