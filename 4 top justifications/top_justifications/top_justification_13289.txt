munger said my was on both the city of chicago payroll and the state of illinois payroll simultaneously taking full salary funding her full pension benefits both as a city worker and as a state worker for years
according to these records mendoza contributed into the state pension fund and into the city pension fund between and the time she served as a state representative while also working for the city
munger is correct when she claims mendoza was on both the state and city payroll and that she fully funded two different pensions but she is incorrect in saying mendoza collected her full salary from the city
but the munger campaign since has doubled down on its claim that mendoza took two government salaries and paid into two public pension systems and now is calling on the chicago democrat to forgo one of her pensions
