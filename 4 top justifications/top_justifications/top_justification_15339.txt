Donald Trump in 2020 "said he trusted the Taliban and then set in motion an even earlier exit" from Afghanistan.
occupy democrats said that trump in said he trusted the taliban and then set in motion an even earlier exit from afghanistan
trump didn t say he trusted taliban but did plan earlier afghanistan exit than biden
in a speech the same day trump reiterated his optimism but again stopped short of saying he trusted the taliban
so many republicans now blasting biden for this exit didn t say s last year when trump actually said he trusted the taliban and then set in motion an even earlier exit
we did not find any instances in which trump said he trusted the taliban
