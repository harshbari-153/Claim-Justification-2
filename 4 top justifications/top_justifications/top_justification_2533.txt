"Eleven states complete their [legislative] sessions within three calendar months, and another five only meet biennially."
our ruling ken block said that eleven states complete their legislative sessions within three calendar months and another five only meet biennially
on their website we found a conference survey of the states showing that did in fact have constitutional requirements that their legislatures meet for no more than calendar days
or the five other states that meet every other year
eleven other state legislatures finish weeks before rhode island s usual june adjournment
other states hit those limits by meeting four or five days a week
