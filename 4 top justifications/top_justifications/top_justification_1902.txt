Health insurance companies are "making record profits, right now."
there have been reports just over the last couple of days of insurance companies making record profits right now obama said during a news conference
we wanted to know if he was correct that insurance companies are making record profits during one of the worst economic recessions on record
at a time when everybody getting hammered they making record profits and premiums are going up
one health insurance company turned a profit but not a record
one health insurance company did report unexpected profits
