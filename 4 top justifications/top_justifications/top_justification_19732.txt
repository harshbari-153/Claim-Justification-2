"According to its website Black Lives Matter, Inc is NOT a charity. It is a full-fledged corporation that does NOT have any locations."
according to its website black lives matter inc is not a charity
other nonprofits named after the black lives matter movement such as the black lives matter foundation in california are not associated with the network buzzfeed news reported june
but nowhere on its website does the black lives matter global network describe itself primarily as a corporation as owens claimed and the organization still operates as a charity
as donations continue to flow into black lives matter some conservative commentators claim the civil rights organization behind the movement is not an actual charity
since the black lives matter global network is not yet its own c organization it does not have publicly available tax returns
