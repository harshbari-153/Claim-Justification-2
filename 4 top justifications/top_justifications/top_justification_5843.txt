"My numbers are better right now than Ronald Reagan's numbers were with Jimmy Carter."
trump said my numbers are better right now than ronald reagan numbers were with jimmy carter
so trump s numbers are not contrary to his assertion better right now than ronald reagan numbers were with jimmy carter
i haven t even started on hillary and my numbers are better right now than ronald reagan numbers were with jimmy carter trump said at about the mark
donald trump wrong about ronald reagan race against jimmy carter
that s an advantage more than twice the size of carter s lead over reagan in at the same point in the campaign
