"Millions of people have given up looking for work altogether."
bush said that millions of people have given up looking for work altogether
so if you use the definition for marginally attached workers then bush is right that millions of people have given up looking for work altogether
we ve already fact checked a similar claim about median incomes being down we rated it true but we wondered whether bush is correct that millions of people have given up looking for work altogether
still the definition of marginally attached workers isn t far off from what bush said and using that yardstick the figure is greater than million people so it qualifies as millions
burtless said he s fairly confident that roughly million adults between the ages of and who are currently not working or looking for work would have been in the labor force if they had faced the same labor market conditions that existed in december
