"There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining."
to that end whitehouse noted that there are already more american jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining
sheldon whitehouse says there are more jobs in solar industry than coal mining
if you add in other coal industry categories it s more than solar for sure
but she noted you have to understand that is one aspect of the coal industry whereas we re talking about the whole solar industry
but have solar industry jobs actually eclipsed the number of jobs
