youngkin said we watched terry mcauliffe when he was governor lower the standards in our schools so that schools that weren t being accredited could now be accredited
youngkin s campaign sent us records of the board s actions when asked for proof of its claim that mcauliffe lowered accreditation standards
mcauliffe ran for governor in promising to deemphasize the state s reliance on its standardized tests in determining public schools accreditation
but what youngkin calls a lowering of standards mcauliffe calls a reform that added fairness to the accreditation process and that in principle received bipartisan legislative support
