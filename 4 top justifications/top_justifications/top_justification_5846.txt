Under my platform, "I will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement."
cotton said that under his platform he will make no changes to the current medicare system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement
cotton said the answer to your question is i will make no changes to the current medicare system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement
in other words current medicare beneficiaries would feel a significant impact if a replacement law is not forthcoming after a repeal
prohibition of medicare advantage plans from imposing higher requirements for some benefits than is required under the traditional program
if obamacare is repealed would that prompt changes to medicare for current beneficiaries
