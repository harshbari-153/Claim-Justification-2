people don t get their social security checks
a reader asked us to explore whether it was true that americans won t get their social security checks if the government shuts down
while obama had said that if there s a government shutdown people don t get their social security checks the reality is that the law provides significant leeway for employing federal workers to carry out social security functions during a shutdown which allowed most checks to go out in
but when looking at the fate of social security during a government shutdown there s an important wrinkle to remember
barack obama says if there a government shutdown social security checks wo get sent
