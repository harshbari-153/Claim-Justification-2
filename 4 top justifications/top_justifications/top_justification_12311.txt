"There is no evidence to support the claim that Guantanamo is used as a recruiting tool" for terrorists.
heck said that there s no evidence that terrorists use guantanamo as a recruiting tool
there is no evidence to support the claim that guantanamo is used as a recruiting tool or affecting relations with allies both of which are being used to advance the president s flawed foreign policy goals heck said in a statement
berger said recruiters can use guantanamo as a wedge issue to further radicalize potential members but there s no hard evidence that it s used as a primary recruiting tool
but the people who are arguing that it is being used as a recruiting tool mainly president obama and his administration have not provided any evidence that it is explicitly being used as a recruiting tool as opposed to passing mentions in propaganda
heck saying there s no evidence that terrorist groups use the site as a recruiting tool directly contradicts one of the president s core arguments for closing the detention center which made us wonder do groups like isis and use guantanamo in any fashion to draw in potential terrorists
