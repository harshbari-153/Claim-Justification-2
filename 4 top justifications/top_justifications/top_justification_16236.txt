Says Republican lieutenants to House Speaker Joe Straus "aired radio ads supporting Democrat(ic state Rep.) Mark Homer... helping the Democrat to a narrow win."
but we are reviewing just a handful of barton s statements starting with this straus republican lieutenants charlie geren jim keffer and byron cook aired radio ads supporting democrat mark homer over conservative republican kirby hollingsworth helping the democrat to a narrow win
the letter from david barton of aledo the state party s former vice chairman lists nearly indicators he says show straus working against both conservative republicans and the advancement of a conservative legislative agenda
and a critic of house speaker joe straus of san antonio distributed a letter the morning of june all but indicting straus and his closest gop house allies as dangerously beholden to democrats
that certainly sounds like several house republicans touting a democratic colleague
also straus wasn t house speaker when the ad aired in so he had no lieutenants
