Says Democratic Party created Planned Parenthood
state stephen martin says democratic party created planned parenthood
martin said that planned parenthood was created by the democratic party
is there any evidence the democratic party created planned parenthood when we asked martin he told us he phrased his claim poorly and should have said the democratic party has sustained planned parenthood
in this we ll look at his contention that the party started planned parenthood
the fact is that both the kkk and planned parenthood are creations of the democratic party martin said
