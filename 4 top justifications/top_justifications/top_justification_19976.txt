"The senior senator from Arizona (John McCain) said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy."
when reid claimed the senior senator from arizona said he could support repealing ask do tell because of the economy the implication seems to be that mccain was making an argument that do ask do tell would harm the economy
it true that mccain listed the poor economy as a reason he would not support do ask do tell but only in the context of the economy needing to be a higher priority for the senate
i repeat the senior senator from arizona said he could support repealing ask do tell because of the economy
but that not the context for mccain comments
john mccain reasoning for his opposition to abolishing the military controversial do ask do tell policy
