The Obama administration is allowing state waivers from welfare work requirements "only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent."
our ruling clinton said in his convention speech that the obama administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by percent and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment
and the administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by percent and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment
here s what clinton said really happened when some republican governors asked if they could have waivers to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work the obama administration listened because we all know it s hard for even people with good work histories to get jobs today
by granting waivers to states the obama administration is seeking to strengthen efforts by letting states try different approaches based on their residents needs
