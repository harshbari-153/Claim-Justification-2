bill clinton said hillary clinton negotiated the first agreement ever where china and india officially committed to reduce their emissions
she negotiated the first agreement ever ever where china and india officially committed to reduce their emissions
hillary clinton did play a key but not solo role in the talks with china and india and it was the first time the two countries made emissions reduction pledges in an international agreement
nonetheless like her husband hillary clinton often touts the accord as one of her major climate change accomplishments referring to it as a key diplomatic breakthrough on her campaign website and recounting how she and obama were hunting down the chinese to get them to the table
china and india did end up agreeing to reduce their emissions and set their own targets but emphasized the pledge was not legally binding
