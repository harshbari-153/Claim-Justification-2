Senate Republicans' move to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in an election year is "not constitutional."
biden said senate republicans move to confirm barrett to the supreme court in an election year is not constitutional
but the republicans move to add barrett to the bench with a confirmation process is not a violation of any specific clause in the constitution legal experts agreed
asked whether he would consider adding justices to the supreme court if elected democratic presidential nominee joe biden claimed senate republicans move to install judge amy coney barrett to the vacant seat less than a month before election day was not constitutional
as for the move to seat barrett before the election two constitutional scholars said that in a general sense the senate republicans actions seem at odds with some of the democratic principles underlying the constitution
but there is no clause in the constitution that would prevent senate republicans from moving forward legal experts said
