"We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book."
obama said we flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book
we flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book and then we tell the police you re a social worker you re the parent you re the teacher you re the drug counselor
he said it was easier for a teen to obtain a glock over a book or a computer
but buying a gun is not likely to be cheaper than buying or borrowing a book or securing access to a computer even for teens in poor neighborhoods
one interpretation is whether a gun is cheaper to get than a book
