"Hundreds of illegal immigrants subject to detainers were released in the last week since the new sanctuary policy was adopted by the Travis County Sheriff's Office."
buckingham said hundreds of illegal immigrants were released in the week after the sheriff s policy was adopted
buckingham s email continued hundreds of illegal immigrants subject to detainers were released in the last week since the new sanctuary policy was adopted by the travis county sheriff office and i am proud the senate has acted quickly in response
dawn buckingham incorrectly says hundreds of illegal immigrants released by travis county
that the new policy had paved the way for the release of suspected unauthorized immigrants the day before
we asked buckingham how she determined hundreds of immigrants were subsequently released
