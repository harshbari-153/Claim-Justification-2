"We're inches away from no longer having a free economy."
but here we ll recap our analysis of his claim that we re inches away from no longer having a free economy
decrying the growth of government as a share of the economy romney said in ames we inches away from no longer having a free economy
we gave romney a pants on fire when he first used the line when his exact wording was we are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy and we see no reason to change that ruling
thus if spending is percent of gdp then we are free and if it grows to percent then we have lost percent of our freedom and are only percent free
the free market is a somewhat vague term
