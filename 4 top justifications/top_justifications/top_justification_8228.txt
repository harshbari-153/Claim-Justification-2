"The top one-tenth of 1 percent" of Americans "own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent."
so does the top of percent of americans own almost as much wealth as the bottom percent
percent of the wealth
sanders said the top of percent of americans own almost as much wealth as the bottom percent
let me be as clear as i can be there is something profoundly wrong when today the top of percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom percent
is the widest since the and a mostly true for saying percent of all new income is going to the top percent
