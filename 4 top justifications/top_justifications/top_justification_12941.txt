"The Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats."
trump said that the electoral college is much more advantageous for democrats
when we checked with political experts they expressed skepticism that the electoral college is much more advantageous to the democrats particularly today
it s hard to call that much more advantageous for the democrats
under that scenario the democrats would need just more electoral votes to clinch the presidency the republicans would have a much tougher road to winning
contrary to trump s assertion there s evidence that the republicans may actually benefit from the electoral college system
