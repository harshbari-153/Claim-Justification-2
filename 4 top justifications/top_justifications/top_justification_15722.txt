The Republican budget plan "says that 10 years from now, if you’re a 65-year-old who’s eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today."
president obama says republican medicare plan would cost people more in years
so where does that leave us with obama claim that the republican plan says that years from now if you re a who s eligible for medicare you should have to pay nearly more than you would today that number is based on a cbo analysis of the republican plan
it says that years from now if you re a who s eligible for medicare you should have to pay nearly more than you would today
but the bottom line is that under the republican plan those who reach in years would pay more out of pocket for private health care
it based on an analysis of the ryan plan by the government nonpartisan congressional budget office which concluded that those who get premium support payments in years will end up paying substantially more for their health care than if medicare is left as is
