Video shows Israelâ€™s Iron Dome missile defense system engaged in military combat.
a video snippet in a facebook post purports to show israel s iron dome defense system targeting a military plane
facebook post about israel s missile defense system shows video game footage
israel itself published videos of iron dome engaged in actual combat but the video featured in this facebook post is not one of them
the text on the post reads israel s iron dome defense system
politifact debunked a similar may post that used footage from the game to falsely claim it showed israel defense system intercepting rockets
