"The Russians didnâ€™t wear uniforms when they came in" to Ukraine.
and secondly i noticed the russians didn t wear uniforms when they came in to ukraine
matthews said the russians didn t wear uniforms when they came in to ukraine
we were interested in matthews claim that the russians didn t wear uniforms when they came in to ukraine
in any case i think it an overstatement to stay the russians were not wearing military uniforms
the safer more accurate statement would be that some russian soldiers appear to have not been wearing uniforms
