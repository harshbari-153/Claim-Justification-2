"All pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel."
while mentioning the proposed keystone xl oil pipeline trump said all pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be american steel
i said where the steel coming from so all pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be american steel which is really a big factor
while mentioning keystone xl donald trump errs in saying pipelines must use only american steel
so while mentioning the keystone which still needs approvals before it can be built trump is claiming all pipelines that are coming into the united states have to be made with american steel
the steel connection meanwhile relates to a memorandum regarding construction of american pipelines that trump signed in january
