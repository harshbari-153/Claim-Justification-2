Says Rick Kriseman is $35 million over budget on St. Petersburgâ€™s new police station.
the fact that kriseman is playing budgetary games does not hide the fact that as documented by the tampa bay times on multiple occasions he is on a spending binge and is tens of millions of dollars over budget on the police station project
his staff highlighted how the tampa bay times editorial board criticized kriseman s spending on the police station and pier
kriseman on the other hand argued the police station is under budget and ahead of schedule a premature statement that we rated mostly false
however before kriseman took office a consultant said the city would need million to build a new police headquarters
the city knew years before kriseman became mayor that it would take more than million to replace police headquarters
