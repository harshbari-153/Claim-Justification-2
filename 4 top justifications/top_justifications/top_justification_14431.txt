Says U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski had "a part in" undoing a law that used to limit how long trains could idle at crossings.
newman said dan lipinski had a part in in lifting a law that used to limit how long trains could idle at crossings
nevertheless hardin contended lipinski has certainly taken part in protecting corporate interests in rail over the best interests of his constituents in other ways such as his role in delaying the deadline by which rail companies are required to implement technology designed to automatically slow or stop speeding trains that experts say could save lives
asked at a canvassing event hosted by indivisible chicago what she would say to constituents frustrated by trains blocking their way on the road newman said it actually used to be a law that idling trains were not allowed
that begs the question how lipinski a congressman could have played a part in putting the brakes on a state legal matter settled in court
the federal government places no limit on how long trains can block crossings but a illinois law formerly allowed local municipalities to fine trains that had come to a stop and blocked a crossing for more than minutes unless the train could not be moved for reasons beyond the rail carrier s control
