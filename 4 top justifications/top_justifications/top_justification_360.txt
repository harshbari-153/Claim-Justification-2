People who are vaccinated for the coronavirus "cannot spread it to you."
biden said that people who are vaccinated for the coronavirus can not spread it to you
multiple studies show that a vaccinated person is significantly less likely to pass the coronavirus to someone else than an unvaccinated person is but the transmission risk is not reduced to zero
but scientists agree that vaccination does cut transmission of the coronavirus significantly even for the delta variant
but even beyond that vaccinated people who do contract the virus have been found to be infectious for a shorter time than those who aren t vaccinated
a study from ume university in sweden found that people without immunity were at a significantly reduced risk of being infected if family members were vaccinated or had experienced a previous coronavirus infection
