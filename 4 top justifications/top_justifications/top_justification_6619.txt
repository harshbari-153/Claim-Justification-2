Says Texas high school graduates must pass Algebra II to be eligible for automatic admission to state's public universities.
we wondered if a student has to clear algebra ii to be considered under the automatic admission law which entitles any graduate of a texas high school ranking in the top percent of his or her class based on grade point average to enroll at any of the state s public universities
our ruling van de putte said students must pass algebra ii to be eligible for college admission under the state s top percent law
and does algebra ii figure in according to an information sheet posted online by the texas education agency a student is eligible for automatic admission under the law if he or she earned a grade point average in the top percent of his or her graduating class
leticia van de putte says algebra ii required for texas students to qualify for college admission under top percent law
practically speaking it makes sense to us that most graduates seeking admission to the state s public universities have taken algebra ii
