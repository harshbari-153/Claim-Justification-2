Mexico is "now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world."
was mexico just rated the most dangerous country in the world
trump tweeted that mexico is now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world
while certainly a cause for concern that s doesn t make mexico the number one most dangerous country
while mexico has a significant problem of violence it is manifestly false that mexico is the most dangerous country in the world mexico s foreign ministry retaliated in a press release about trump s tweet
to maintain that mexico is the most violent country in the world would be a very subjective claim and to say it s the most homicidal is certifiably wrong olson said
