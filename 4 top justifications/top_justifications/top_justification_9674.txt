"It's important to pay attention to the Russian spy drama, but let's not ignore the fact that the following (10) bills have been introduced" in the House.
ok it important to pay attention to the russian spy drama but let not ignore the fact that the following bills have been introduced
the social media post listed bills that it said have been introduced in the house by republicans
so the post is largely correct but it includes some exaggerated language and it fails to distinguish between agenda items and priorities further back in the pack
so just one of these bills have attracted of more than out of the house members
if you inhabit the more liberal corners of social media you may have seen a list of republican bills in your feed a reminder of the substantive changes that could result from unified gop control of washington
