"The reality is when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way."
the reality is when you look at the biden plan it reads an awful lot like what president trump and i and our task force have been doing every step of the way pence said
pence claimed the biden plan to address was similar to the trump administration s plan every step of the way
because continues to spread throughout the united states with nearly million cases and upward of deaths we decided to examine both the trump and biden plans to curb the pandemic and investigate whether pence was on target in his charge that the biden plan is rooted in trump s ideas
and quite frankly when i look at their plan he added it looks a little bit like plagiarism which is something joe biden knows a little bit about
there s also a reality check if biden wins and attempts to implement his plan it s important to consider that no matter how well thought out it looks on paper he may not be able to accomplish everything
