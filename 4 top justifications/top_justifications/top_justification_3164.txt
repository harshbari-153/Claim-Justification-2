"@Jorge_Elorza still think your plan is safe? Rescue Captain Kenyon just worked 96 hours straight. 96 hours."
still think your plan is safe rescue captain kenyon just worked hours straight
kenyon who doesn t remember how much sleep he had during the hours says he was able to operate safely
pare asserts that the captain had ample opportunity to get the rest necessary to perform effectively in emergency situations and kenyon could have asked to go home if he felt he hadn t had enough sleep to operate safely
to be more accurate doughty could have said that kenyon had been on duty for hours
so kenyon was not on his feet like a construction worker or an emergency room nurse for straight hours
