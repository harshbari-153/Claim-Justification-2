Says Hillary Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and appeared "wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury."
rove said clinton spent days in the hospital and then emerged wearing glasses that only people with traumatic brain injury use
there are two points for us to cover in this fact check the time clinton spent in the hospital and the nature of the glasses she wore for weeks afterward
rove clinton hospital stay and glasses point to traumatic brain injury
and when she reappears she wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury we need to know what up with that
while rove never claimed clinton suffered brain damage he was wrong about the hospital stay and combined that with the glasses to exaggerate the nature of clinton s injury
