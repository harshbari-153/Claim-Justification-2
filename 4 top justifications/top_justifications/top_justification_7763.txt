There was a "loss of eight million jobs during the Bush eight years."
the loss of eight million jobs occurred during a roughly period shared more or less equally between bush and obama
a reader asked us whether reid was correct that there was a loss of eight million jobs during the bush eight years
in other words reid had a point in saying that there was a loss of eight million jobs but it didn t come during the bush eight years
the loss of eight million jobs during the bush eight years two wars started unfunded all on borrowed money these tax cuts all on borrowed money if the tax cuts were so good the economy should be thriving
so where does this leave us reid is correct that more than million jobs were lost in the united states during the recent economic downturn but he s flat wrong to say that it happened during the bush eight years
