"San Juan Teamsters didn't show up for work to distribute relief supplies" because they went on strike.
post on the gateway pundit read san juan teamsters didn t show up for work to distribute relief supplies u
bloggers said that san juan teamsters did show up for work to distribute relief supplies because they went on strike after hurricane maria
the post claimed that while the liberal media is attacking president donald trump s response to the humanitarian crisis the real issue is that the teamsters union drivers did not show up to work
there s no mention of strike in the press release and nothing in valle s interview about labor unions so where did the the conservative treehouse get that from an interview with a trucker not affiliated with the teamsters union
but there s no strike and union truck drivers have been trying to move aid shipments across puerto rico
