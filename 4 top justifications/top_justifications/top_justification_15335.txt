Vaccine herd immunity doesnâ€™t exist because 100% of the population would have to be vaccinated for it to work.
an instagram post claims that vaccine herd immunity doesn t exist because of the population would need to get vaccinated for that to be achieved
herd immunity is in fact that enough people are vaccinated that the transmission chains are disrupted and people who are vaccinated or not are less likely to be exposed
herd immunity is not everybody is vaccinated therefore the disease goes away said dr
for scientists have tossed around different estimates of how much of the population needs to be immune either naturally or by vaccine in order for herd immunity to work well
herd immunity occurs when enough people are immune either through vaccination or previous infection to make its spread from person to person unlikely
