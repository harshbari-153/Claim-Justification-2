As Tennessee governor, Phil Bredesen "supported higher taxes on us. Higher gas taxes. Higher sales taxes."
americans for prosperity said that bredesen supported higher gas and sales taxes
but when our state s budget was in crisis phil bredesen supported higher taxes on us
at times bredesen suggested the gas tax might need to go up
bredesen made it a point to avoid raising the sales tax but he was quite open to other ways to boost revenues especially as the state struggled through the recession
according to the tax foundation a group that tracks state and federal revenues the rate went from percent to percent right before bredesen took office and didn t change on his watch
