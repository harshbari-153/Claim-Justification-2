Says Hillary Clinton’s immigration platform would "create totally open borders."
trump said clinton s immigration platform would create totally open borders
donald trump says hillary clinton would create open borders
claiming that clinton would create totally open borders is a serious charge that suggests allowing people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries
so if clinton hasn t called for open borders what does she want to do on immigration
trump can t claim clinton is for open borders while she has also supported massive increases in border security to better enforce our restrictive immigration laws
