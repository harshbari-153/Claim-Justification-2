When Congress sought documents from President Barack Obama, the White House "didn’t do anything. They didn’t give one letter of the request. Many requests were made. They didn’t give a letter."
trump said that when congress sought documents from obama the white house didn t do anything
trump is wrong that obama white house refused to turn over documents in congressional probes
the trump white house did not respond to an inquiry for this article
president obama from what they tell me was under a similar kind of a thing didn t give one letter
it s worth noting that the obama administration didn t hand over documents
