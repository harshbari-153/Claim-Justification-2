"Wisconsin's still one of the highest-taxed states in the country."
pade said wisconsin still one of the states in the country
richard auxier a research associate with the tax policy center at the urban institute it looks like it s a stretch to say wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the country he said
unfortunately wisconsin s still one of the states in the country
is he right about wisconsin s tax status
what about wisconsin s rank for specific taxes
