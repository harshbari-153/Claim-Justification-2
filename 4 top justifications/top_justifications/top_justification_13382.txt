If public employees donâ€™t pay more for benefits starting April 1, 2011, "the equivalent" is 1,500 state employee layoffs by June 30, 2011 and 10,000 to 12,000 state and local government employee layoffs in the next two years.
gov scott walker says if public employees don t start paying more for benefits by april the equivalent is layoffs now and to in next budget
that would reveal the number of local government layoffs that are the equivalent of the amount of reductions in state aid
he added the equivalent at the state level for the next budget would be to state government employees being laid off and to local government employees
in other words the amount of state money that local governments would lose would be the equivalent of what they could save by laying off to employees
walker also said cited layoffs of local government employees
