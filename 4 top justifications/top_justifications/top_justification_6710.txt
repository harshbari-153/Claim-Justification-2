Says Will Rasmussen falsely claimed he had lived in the West Linn district for about a year.
the house republican group said rasmussen lied
oregon house republicans say will rasmussen was caught misstating his residency
the mailer reads will rasmussen only moved to our community one year ago but lied about it thinking he wouldn t get caught
rasmussen then said he had moved into an apartment in west linn in september
so why would he stretch the truth on something so trivial why indeed rasmussen does meet the constitutional residency requirement which is to have lived in the district one year at the time of election
