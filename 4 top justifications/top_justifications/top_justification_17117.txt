Says "Mike Madigan and Kwame Raoul team up to raise property taxes."
harold says mike madigan and kwame raoul team up to raise property taxes
we do say though that raoul and madigan endorsed a property tax increase
by stating that raoul and madigan teamed up to raise property taxes she erroneously implies that raising taxes was the proposal s central aim
i m erika harold and this scheme is one of the worst mike madigan and kwame raoul team up to raise property taxes she continues as a picture of the democratic house speaker and raoul flashes with text characterizing their collaboration as a scheme
yet harold s claim spuriously suggests raoul teamed up with madigan for the express purpose of hiking taxes leaving out all mitigating context
