Images of crowds and crowded arenas were taken "today in Tulsa Oklahoma"
the fourth photo appears to be from outside the tulsa rally where hundreds lined up early to get in an abc news affiliate reported
if you thought every photo looked like a different event in this collection of images supposedly showing president donald trump s rally in tulsa okla
but most of these photos including the two biggest photos are from different events and they re being deployed en masse here to paint a misleading picture about trump s rally in tulsa
photos show a protest and other events not trump s tulsa rally
both the third and fifth photos which are actually the same picture show a crowd gathering in great falls mont
