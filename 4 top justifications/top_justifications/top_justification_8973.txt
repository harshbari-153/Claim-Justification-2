"President Obama is actually increasing Bush-era defense spending by $21 billion in the new fiscal year."
that a long way of explaining that if you include the costs of the wars there an overall billion increase in defense spending under the obama budget
in response to republican complaints that the obama administration is gutting the military msnbc keith olbermann fired back saying that obama is actually increasing defense spending
obama proposed budget calls for billion in base defense spending and estimates a placeholder amount of billion to fund the wars overseas
brian riedl a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative heritage foundation said that while obama defense budget may go up a little some parts of defense spending will go up while other parts go down
together with base defense spending of billion it comes to total military spending of billion
