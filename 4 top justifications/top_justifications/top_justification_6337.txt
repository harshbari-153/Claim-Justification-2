how extreme lapierre said sunstein is a man who wants to give legal standing to animals so they can sue you for eating meat
and lapierre is correct when he says that sunstein has talked about allowing animals to sue albeit through a human representative
sunstein was saying you the meat eater could be sued by porky pig for eating bacon
sunstein has said people ought to be able to sue on behalf of abused animals
the quote comes from sunstein book animal rights current debates and new directions
