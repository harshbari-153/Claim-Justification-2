"60% of patients admitted to the hospital in the UK have been fully vaccinated"
a viral facebook post repeated the incorrect statistic and said of patients admitted to the hospital in the uk have been fully vaccinated
a uk health official misspoke when he said of hospitalized patients had been fully vaccinated
it suggests that of hospitalized patients are people who were at least partly vaccinated
of people who tested positive for and had been fully vaccinated in the u
the fact that anybody is going to the hospital particularly a big percentage of people who are going to the hospital who have already been vaccinated is the opposite of what they been telling us here in the united states carlson said
