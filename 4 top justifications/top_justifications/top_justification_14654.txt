Senior citizens qualify for a Medicare "flex card" that pays for groceries, dental costs and prescriptions.
a facebook post says that senior citizens can get a medicare flex card that pays for groceries and prescriptions
the facebook post says an american over i qualified for the elderly spend card which pays for my groceries my dental and my prescription refills
clicking the link on the post brings users to a website that says seniors can get their medicare flex card for a limited time with a photo of a debit card
though the post implies that anyone over is eligible for such a card medicare the federal health insurance program for senior citizens and those with disabilities does not provide the cards
private insurance companies that sell certain plans called medicare advantage are allowed to offer customers a prepaid debit card sometimes referred to as flex cards
