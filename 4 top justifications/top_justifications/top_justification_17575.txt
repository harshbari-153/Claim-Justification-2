President Barack Obama's "initial response when we heard about the Christmas underwear bomber" was to say that "this was the act of an isolated extremist."
that would seem to contradict the notion that obama wanted his listeners to believe that the christmas day bomber was simply an isolated extremist
cheney says obama initially said christmas day bomber was an extremist
here we focusing on whether cheney was correct to say that obama initial response to the incident was that it was the act of an isolated extremist
ultimately cheney is correct that obama did use the words an isolated extremist in his first statement addressing the christmas day bombing attempt
and it worth noting that two days earlier an unnamed white house official was quoted in the wall street journal saying we believe this was an attempted act of terrorism
