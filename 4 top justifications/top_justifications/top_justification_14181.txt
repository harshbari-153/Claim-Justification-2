Page 92 of the House health care bill "says specifically that people can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain."
instead we interested in bachmann claim that page of the bill prevents people from buying private health insurance after a certain date
she said that on page of the new bill it says specifically that people ca purchase private health insurance after a date certain which means people will ultimately go into a plan where it is government providing health care and only one single government system
bachmann is incorrect that people ca purchase private health insurance after a date certain
she said it was a clause that allows people who would be eligible for coverage in the new health care exchange to keep an old policy they like
this is similar to a claim we checked back in july when the editorial page of investor business daily said the bill would outlaw private insurance
