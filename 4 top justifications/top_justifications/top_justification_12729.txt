"No family earns too much to qualify" for Oregon Healthy Kids program.
oregon healthy kids says no matter how much you make you qualify for health care program
that said it seems to us oregon healthy kids could have been more precise in their advertising families do have to meet certain income limits to qualify for assistance
any oregon family with an uninsured child has a path to healthy kids regardless of income she said
we decided to check in with cathy kaufmann manager of the healthy kids office and see whether it s true that any family can qualify for the program
flying above pictures of healthy kids and their families and physicians is the sentence no family earns too much to qualify
