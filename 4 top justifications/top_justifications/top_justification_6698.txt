Says "MAX carries 30 percent of evening rush-hour commuters traveling from Downtown on the Sunset and Banfield freeways."
in an advertisement trimet said the max carries percent of evening rush hour commuters traveling from downtown on the sunset and banfield freeways
but in a recent advertisement trimet pulled out an interesting statistic max carries percent of evening rush hour commuters traveling from downtown on the sunset and banfield freeways
do percent of banfield and sunset evening commuters use the max
if you compare those figures with the max commuting figure you find that trimet is right on the money about percent of evening commuters along the banfield and sunset highways use the max
here s how trimet figured it out they picked two points for gauging the traffic both car and max leaving downtown portland on either of the freeways they mentioned
