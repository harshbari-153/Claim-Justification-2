"If the Dow Joans ever falls more than 1000 ‘points’ in a Single Day the sitting president should be 'loaded' into a very big cannon and Shot into the sun at TREMENDOUS SPEED! No excuses!"
if the dow joans ever falls more than points in a single day the sitting president should be into a very big cannon and shot into the sun at tremendous speed no excuses
important question would one want said president to make it to the sun or simply impart the amount of inertia required to get something of their mass to the sun one is much more complex the other and could create many jobs linking to a diagram and math formula for shooting trump to the sun
not long after president donald trump boasted about the stock market gains a fake trump tweet surfaced in which he vowed that such a drop in the dow joans should result in the president being shot out of a cannon into the sun
fake trump tweet about dow joans dropping called for trump to be shot from a cannon into sun
omg did the dumb sob really spell it joans
