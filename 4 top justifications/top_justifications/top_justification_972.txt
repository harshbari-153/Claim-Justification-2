The government is closing businesses to stop the spread of coronavirus even though "the numbers are nothing compared to H1N1 or Ebola. Everyone needs to realize our government is up to something ..."
really they re the most important tool government officials have to stop the spread of the coronavirus which scientists say is far more contagious than the flu
a viral facebook post on coronavirus that says the government is to something
the deadly virus is killing americans right now and abiding by unprecedented orders to stay home is the best way to halt its spread
most importantly any suggestion that the coronavirus isn t real or that it s part of a government conspiracy is a ridiculous claim
liquor stores did close in pennsylvania as government officials scrambled to halt the spread of the coronavirus but all the other claims made in this post are false
