"After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs."
after prohibition ended police deaths did reach a year again until the year nixon declared war on drugs
but the numbers behind the claim that police deaths did reach a year again until the year nixon declared war on drugs are a bit off
nixon began the war on drugs in but police deaths actually topped the year before that in
a viral image making the rounds on compared the number of police officer deaths during prohibition to the drug war after prohibition ended police deaths did reach a year again until the year nixon declared war on drugs the image said
and whatever the cause of officers deaths in a given period the war on drugs still doesn t compare to prohibition when for years an average of officers died every year
