"Spike protein goes to nucleus and impairs DNA repair."
without more context the title of a youtube video spike protein goes to nucleus and impairs dna repair may sound alarming
the researchers found that spike proteins were present in the cell nucleus the part of the cell that houses dna
their findings differ from previous studies that have found the spike protein to be located primarily outside the nucleus
dna damage from spike proteins in lab study does not apply directly to vaccines
blog posts claim that a recent paper shows evidence that the spike protein on the virus can cause dna damage raising concerns about vaccine safety
