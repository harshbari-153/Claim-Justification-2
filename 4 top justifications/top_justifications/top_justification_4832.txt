Says Milwaukee County buses are no less safe now than a year or two ago.
milwaukee county executive chris abele says county buses are no less safe now than a year or two ago
so buses were less safe this year than in but more safe this year than in
but abele s claim about buses being no less safe than a year or two ago flies in the face of the passenger altercation stats
if the sheriff has given you the impression that transit is less safe than it was a year ago or the year before that then he s giving the wrong impression
the numbers are a bit of a mixed bag but show lawbreaking and violence is a consistent if relatively uncommon phenomenon on county buses that mcts officials are quick to point out provide million passenger trips a year on buses most without incident
