"Tea Party Congressman Frank Guinta voted for billions in cuts to veterans programs."
tea party congressman frank guinta voted for billions in cuts to veterans programs a narrator declares in the ad debt aired on
all things considered we find it a distortion to say guinta has voted to cut money for veterans programs
the house republicans budget resolution to support their claim that guinta voted to cut veterans funding
so in this case guinta initially voted to increase veterans funding but then when the legislation was expanded to include other spending he voted against the bill
but voting against an increase isn t the same as a vote to cut veterans funding
