"Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling (John Kasichâ€™s) super PAC."
a ad says millionaires working side by side with george soros are bankrolling his kasich s super pac
millionaires working side by side with george soros are bankrolling his super pac the ad s narrator says of kasich as images of kasich and soros appear above the words hundreds of thousands of dollars from george soros
donations totalling from two guys who once worked with soros hardly equate to bankrolling kasich
the idea that soros would clandestinely donate to a super pac is silly based on campaign finance rules said tom sutton political science professor at baldwin wallace university
soros could give a million to new day for america said sutton referencing the super pac supporting kasich
