A gun "background check is futile. Something like 42 (people during the) last year â€¦ were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million."
something like people during the last year were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of million
something like people during the last year of record were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of million
if people out of million were the only ones deterred from legally buying a gun because of a background check then maybe futile would be an accurate description
to make a bold claim like the system is futile and then leave out the thousands of individuals denied a firearm because of a background check is misleading
gun supporter says few prosecutions show that background checks do work
