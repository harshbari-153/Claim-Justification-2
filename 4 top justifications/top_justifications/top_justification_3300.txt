"Pam Bondi told a group of lobbyists she’ll side with corporate special interests as attorney general."
but as the commercial continues gelber makes the following claim against his republican challenger pam bondi told a group of lobbyists she ll side with corporate special interests as attorney general
dan gelber claims pam bondi told lobbyists she side with corporate special interests
the statement that bondi told a group of lobbyists she ll side with corporate special interests as attorney general certainly sounded like quite a discussion if it indeed took place
did bondi tell a group of lobbyists that she ll side with corporate special interests she describes herself as and she did tell a group of lobbyists business owners and fundraisers from aif and the florida chamber of commerce that she sided with their stance against public unionization votes
gelber argument then is that bondi told business groups that she endorses a position they ve taken and took aim at her opponent by saying he would act tough on business interests
