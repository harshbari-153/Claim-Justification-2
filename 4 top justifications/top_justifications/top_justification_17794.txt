Says Gov. Tony Evers "wants to release half of the prison population."
vos claimed in a newsletter that evers wants to release half of the prison population
vos took aim at the governor in the email saying evers wants to release half of the prison population
tony evers pledge to reduce the state s prison population by half as a sign evers isn t tough on crime
but that s a far cry from releasing half the prison population overnight which is what vos claim suggests
and evers and his supporters have been clear from the start that this is a goal to be achieved over time through steps that prevent fewer people from entering prison in the first place
