Says North Carolina bill to require in-person learning is "stripping out some of the health protocols that are in place."
cooper said a republican bill that would require counties to enact learning is stripping out some of the health protocols that are in place
however a parent whose child attends a school operating under plan b may hear cooper s comments and think the republican bill would remove some health protocols that are already in place
cooper s use of the word strip could give parents the impression the bill would change health protocols that are already in place
however the bill itself does not automatically strip schools of any health protocols for learning
the bill requires schools to follow protocols laid out in the strong schools nc public health toolkit that was developed by the health department led by mandy cohen as well as the department of public instruction
