"Japan drops all vaxxine mandates, places myocarditis warning on label."
an article headline said japan drops all vaxxine mandates places myocarditis warning on label
japan drops all vaxxine mandates places myocarditis warning on label said the headline on an article from brisbane national review
the article shared on facebook also said that japan had placed a myocarditis warning on vaccine labels which is accurate
japan placed myocarditis warnings on vaccine labels in december but it never implemented a vaccine mandate and has no compulsory vaccinations at all
the headline gives the misleading impression that japan rescinded an existing vaccine mandate because of concerns over myocarditis
