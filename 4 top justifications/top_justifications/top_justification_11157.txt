The United States has "the highest corporate tax rate in the free world."
does the have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world
bolling said the united states has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world
just to you a little bit responded bolling we have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world
we separately checked beckel s claim about deductions but in this check we ll see whether bolling is correct that the united states corporate tax rate ranks as the highest in the free world
however the united states corporate tax rate doesn t appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account
