Says Texas Senate hopeful Donna Campbell doesn’t live in the district she’s hoping to win in 2012.
democratic blogger says donna campbell does live in senatorial district she hoping to represent
our sense based on available information is that while campbell formerly lived in colorado county and was even still registered to vote there at the time of the burnt orange report blog post she settled in the district and obtained a driver s license there some time after voting in october and before the blogger aired her claim
as we began to check into the residency question representatives of the colorado county tax s office told us campbell was registered to vote in the county under the name donna burrows campbell
donna by the way does not currently live in the senatorial district
declining our request to interview campbell he said that if campbell were pulled over for speeding she d pull out her driver s license showing that address
