"The DEA just raided a United States senator â€” Dems in a panic."
the dea just raided a united states senator dems in a panic read the headline on a june post on newsfeedhunter
claim that democratic senator busted by dea is fake news
the fictitious saga led to the pretend senator death and more including implicating chelsea clinton and tying the dea raid to a previous fake yarn about the clinton foundation smuggling contraband and refugees
the saga telegraphed it s contrived premise calling malroney an obviously fictitious name and suddenly referred to lindsay as a senator from wyoming not just having a ranch in wyoming the state s senators are actually republicans mike enzi and john barrasso
a fake news story that claimed a senator from new jersey was being investigated by the drug enforcement agency is another tall tale concocted by a website run by a liberal troll
