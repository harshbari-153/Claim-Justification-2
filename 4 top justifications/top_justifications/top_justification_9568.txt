"I believe in tax cuts. I believe in being a supply-sider. I cut the income tax I think it was 24 percent. We got 42 percent more revenues."
with advocate steve forbes of the magazine family as an economic adviser giuliani keeps claiming that his tax cuts created the growth
it does sound like much to say the tax rate fell from
the tax cut he refers to clearly was a giuliani initiative and in the same way that we refer to reagan tax cuts that were studied modified and approved by congress we have concluded that giuliani initiative on this is clear enough to be lenient in judging the i claim
so let just pause on economics the popular version of which is that reducing the tax rate actually increases the tax revenue by giving people more incentive to produce income
but to link the revenue growth to the tax cut brings us into the world of economics
