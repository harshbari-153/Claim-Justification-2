is the ad right that michelle nunn admits to financial ties to terrorists
the leaked memos lay out nunn campaign strategy and include among other things detailed fundraising plans a public relations strategy and list of anticipated attacks in the race
and about that connection perdue spokesman derrick dickey said the statement was based first on nunn s leaked documents and then cited a national review story following up on the leak as evidence of the terrorist connection
