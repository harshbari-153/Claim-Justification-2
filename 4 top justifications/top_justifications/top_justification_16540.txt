The sequester "won’t consider whether we’re cutting some bloated program that has outlived its usefulness, or a vital service that Americans depend on every single day. It doesn’t make those distinctions."
in this item we exploring his broader comment that a sequester won t consider whether we re cutting some bloated program that has outlived its usefulness or a vital service that americans depend on every single day
however obama is right that the sequester does require uniform cuts to thousands of programs with nothing to focus steeper cuts on ineffective or less important programs
so obama has some justification for saying the sequester does see distinctions between effective and ineffective government programs
ways in which the sequester does allow for some flexibility however obama s statement is somewhat misleading because within the specific programs targeted for cuts federal managers have a fair amount of discretion about what to reduce
ways in which the sequester doesn t make distinctions in federal spending cuts when the white house and republicans had a showdown over the debt ceiling in they set up the sequester as something of a poison pill budget cuts that would be so harmful they would force both sides to make a deal
