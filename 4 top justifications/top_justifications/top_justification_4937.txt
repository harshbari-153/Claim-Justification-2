"Infection rates in Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state."
borrello said that infection rates in allegany cattaraugus and chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state
while infection rates in allegany cattaraugus and chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state throughout the crisis our linkage with erie county and its higher infection rates means that we don t meet the metrics for reopening and our hurting rural economies must remain shut down for at least another two weeks borrello said in the statement
we found that as borrello had said allegany cattaraugus and chautauqua counties ranked low in infection rates consistently over that period while erie and niagara started higher and continued to rise
our analysis found that chautauqua never ranked higher than sixth from the bottom for infection rates among the new york counties for which data was available and chautauqua had the lowest rate of any county for much of the period
but we wondered whether borrello was correct in his may statement that the infection rates in the three rural counties was substantially lower than those of the more urbanized counties to the north and consistently among the state lowest
