Under the Hate Crimes bill, "any pastor, preacher, priest, rabbi or imam who gives a sermon out of their moral traditions about sexual practices could be found guilty of a federal crime."
i disdain racism sexism and bigotry but under this legislation any pastor preacher priest rabbi or imam who gives a sermon out of their moral traditions about sexual practices could be found guilty of a federal crime the minnesota republican stated in an oct
therefore to put a fine point on it any pastor preacher priest rabbi or imam who may give a sermon out of their moral traditions about sexual practices could presumably under this legislation be found to have aided abetted or induced in the commission of a federal crime
john kline and other republicans say under hate crime bill religious leaders could be prosecuted for preaching about sexual practices
during the presidential campaign barack obama was criticized for his support of the hate crimes legislation by an evangelical group that claimed the bill would put churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality
but we also think it wrong for opponents of the bill to again raise the scare tactic that it might lead to the prosecution of preachers who condemn homosexuality from the pulpit
