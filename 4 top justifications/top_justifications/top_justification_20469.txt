Insurance companies and Washington bureaucrats "are working together to swipe $500 billion from Medicare to pay for Pelosi and Schumerâ€™s out-of-control spending spree."
the doctor then explains that he can no longer provide the medicine to her because insurance companies and washington bureaucrats are working together to swipe billion from medicare to pay for house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader chuck schumer s spending spree
so the ad s charged language that pelosi and schumer are proposing to swipe this money from medicare is incorrect
the plus association ran an advertisement that claimed medicare drug price negotiations were swiping billion from medicare and going to be used as a way to cut benefits and no longer pay for lifesaving medicines
if congress approves democrats plan to let medicare negotiate drug prices the government would be paying less to pharmaceutical companies for the same drugs
medicare negotiation refers to the federal government bargaining directly with pharmaceutical companies on the price of prescription drugs
