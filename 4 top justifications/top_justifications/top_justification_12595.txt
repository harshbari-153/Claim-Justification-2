Says Scott Bruun supports "cutting the Department of Commerce and eliminating NOAA."
kurt schrader says scott bruun wants to cut the department of commerce and eliminate noaa
so far as we can tell there are basically two pieces to schrader s initial claim bruun advocates possible cuts to the department of commerce and bruun advocates eliminating noaa
spokeswoman alee lockman said bruun no longer supports eliminating those departments but he stands behind his statement that the departments need to be reviewed for possible savings
cutting the department of commerce and eliminating noaa is not going to be a good message to those guys
he took his republican challenger scott bruun to task saying bruun was poised to undermine the whole deal
