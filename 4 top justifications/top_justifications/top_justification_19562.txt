"700 jobs (were) lost because Allen Boyd" voted for the health care bill.
our ruling in the ad the national republican congressional committee says jobs were lost because allen boyd voted for the federal health care bill
the question for this fact check to address then comes down to those jobs how they were impacted by the health care bill and what boyd could have done to stop any job losses
it much more accurate for instance to say that the jobs were lost because the health care bill passed
it important to note that while this fact check that boyd vote on health care cost his district jobs is about the federal health care legislation it not specifically about health care
jobs lost because allen boyd sided with nancy pelosi
