Republicans have " won a thousand seats since Obamacare."
we ve won a thousand seats since obamacare he said
we have a thousand seats we ve won since obamacare
duffy said we ve won a thousand seats since obamacare
therefore obamacare is not the sole reason for the gop seat gains but one of many
while duffy did not directly blame obamacare for the loss of every seat he presented it as the primary reason for the republican gains and democrat declines
