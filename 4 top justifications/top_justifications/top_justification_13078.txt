"Bill Richardson is the only major Democratic candidate with a plan to withdraw all American troops from Iraq. All of the other major Democratic candidates support leaving American troops in Iraq indefinitely."
bill richardson claims for himself a place among the top tier candidates hillary clinton barack obama and john edwards as he seeks to distinguish himself from the field on iraq saying he is alone among this group to want to withdraw all the troops
we wo take any points off for richardson claim to be among the major candidates here but we will lower his rating because the other candidates have not said they want troops in iraq indefinitely as richardson suggests
richardson wants all troops out
richardson says a small force will be ineffective and all troops should come home
the others candidate want to leave residual forces in iraq to be on hand for peacekeeping purposes or in case terrorists mount an offensive
