"Instagram has been limiting our posts so that no more than 7% of our friends see our posts."
instagram has been limiting our posts so that no more than of our friends see our posts
but this is a different issue than the claim that instagram is limiting people s posts so that no more than of their friends will see it
we ve noticed an uptick in posts about instagram limiting the reach of your photos to of your followers and would love to clear this up instagram tweeted
no instagram is blocking your posts from all but of your friends
after we published this we heard from some readers who argued that we were wrong because instagram limits the reach of posts that include false information
