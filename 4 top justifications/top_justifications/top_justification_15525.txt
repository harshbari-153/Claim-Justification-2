Women "earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position."
our ruling david cicilline said women earn only cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position
it is unacceptable that women continue to earn only cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position
only in of the categories did women earn at least cents for every dollar that the men earned
if you look at hourly pay for all workers table women earned cents for every dollar men earned that year
because cicilline said women earned only cents for every dollar that men earned in the same position we decided to focus on his statement
