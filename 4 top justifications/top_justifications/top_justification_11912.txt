Woonsocket needs a garbage-burning power plant because "residents are paying through the nose for electricity thatâ€™s fueled by foreign oil, at prices that are skyrocketing."
brien says woonsocket needs power plant because of the high price of electricity generated by foreign oil
but it was his second point that the plant is needed because residents are paying through the nose for electricity that s fueled by foreign oil at prices that are skyrocketing that really jumped out at us
power plants in rhode island converted long ago from burning oil to burning natural gas
rather than burying trash in the ground and that being the end of it why not use it to create electricity brien said in an interview
when we asked brien about this discrepancy he insisted that oil is used to generate electricity used locally
