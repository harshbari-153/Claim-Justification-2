spicer said there one study that came out of pew in that showed percent of people who voted were noncitizens
the study that shows percent of people who voted were noncitizens has been widely criticized for its methodology and spicer cites the findings incorrectly
if percent of all voters in were noncitizens that would have to mean that more than percent of america s noncitizen population voted
the researchers wrote in the washington post that about percent of noncitizens in their sample said they were registered to vote and they deduced that about percent of noncitizens actually voted in the election
