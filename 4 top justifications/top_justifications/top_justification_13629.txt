Alaska's Prince William Sound "is pristine now."
rush limbaugh says alaska prince william sound is now pristine
the place is pristine now
prince william sound has mostly recovered visually jones said but to call it pristine is an overstatement
on the surface you probably say this looks pretty pristine
it looks pristine but it not pristine if your definition is that there no oil left
