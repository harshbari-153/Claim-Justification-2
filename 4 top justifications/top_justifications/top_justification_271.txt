Say "Sam Hyde identified as perpitrator (sic) of Beirut explosion"
the one from the times said sam hyde identified as perpitrator of beirut explosion
the bbc headline was lebanese police confrim samuel hyde is behind the explosion
and now just as absurdly the name has been linked to beirut and the devastating explosion there
they tied the name to the paris attacks not to mention saying hyde was the mastermind behind the coronavirus
this is more sam hyde nonsense
