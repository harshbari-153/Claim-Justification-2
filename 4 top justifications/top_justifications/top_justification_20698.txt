John McCain and George Bush have "absolutely no plan for universal health care."
absolutely no plan for universal health care
mccain does have a health care plan but there no clause for making it apply to everyone and therefore universal
bush does not support any sort of health care mandate nor does mccain
universal health care has been much debated in the democratic primary campaign but hardly mentioned on the republican side
no mandate no universal care
