"Within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security."
within a few years we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security
so he is incorrect that within a few years we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security
if federal spending isn t restrained at all and if tax cuts become permanent by interest payments might sneak past national defense
the possible presidential candidate then declared that servicing that debt will soon cost more than national security
as two budget analysts we interviewed confirmed interest payments will grow explosively over the next decade but do not exceed security spending in any given year much less in a few years
