"You cannot build a little guy up by tearing a big guy down -- Abraham Lincoln said it."
kasich said that lincoln said you can t build a little guy up by tearing the big guy down
you can t build a little guy up by tearing the big guy down kasich said

it s that this is not a lincoln quote
reagan said what democrats truly do understand is the principle so eloquently stated by abraham lincoln you can not strengthen the weak by weakening the strong
