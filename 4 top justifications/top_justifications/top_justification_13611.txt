The Texas abortion law "provides at least six weeks for a person to be able to get an abortion."
abbott said that the new texas abortion law provides at least six weeks for a person to be able to get an abortion
in the recent federal court case about the texas abortion law a director of a center that provides abortions said in about of abortions were for patients up to five weeks and six days from their last menstral period
the texas policy evaluation project at the university of texas found in a survey of abortion patients at facilities that were less than six weeks pregnant at the time of their abortion
in texas most patients seeking an abortion must first receive counseling and then wait hours before getting the procedure
abbott s comment that a woman would have six weeks to get an abortion distorts the timeline of pregnancy and assumes a woman would know almost immediately after intercourse that she was pregnant
