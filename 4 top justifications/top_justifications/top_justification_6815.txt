rooting for the red sox is like rooting for the drug companies brown said
is rooting for the red sox really like rooting for the drug companies it s a claim difficult to quantify but we re talking baseball bragging rights here not more mundane topics like reforming social security or extending jobless benefits
sherrod brown likens rooting for the red sox to rooting for the drug companies
to root for the yankees or the red sox he said is the functional equivalent of rooting for microsoft or general electric
and while red sox fans may protest we call them as we see them
