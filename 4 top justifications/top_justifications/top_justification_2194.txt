Says in Washington, D.C., Sen. Richard Burr "took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks."
ross said burr took millions from special interests went there and cashed in voted to cut his own taxes and raise taxes on working folks
and the ad is correct that burr did vote to cut taxes on wealthy people like himself
we wondered if it was true that burr became a millionaire in washington then voted to cut taxes for millionaires like himself
you took millions from special interests went there and cashed in voted to cut your own taxes and raise taxes on working folks ross tells the fictional burr in the ad
the question of whether burr voted to increase taxes on middle class or working people is trickier
