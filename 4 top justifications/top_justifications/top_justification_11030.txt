Republican plan to extend Bush tax cuts "would double deficit projections going forward for the next couple of decades."
what the republicans want to do is extend these tax cuts make them permanent to the wealthy and the cbo congressional budget office has estimated that would double the deficit projections going forward for the next couple of decades kaine a former virginia governor said during a cnn interview
a permanent extension of all those tax cuts without future increases in taxes or reductions in federal spending would roughly double the projected budget deficit in the report said
tim kaine says republican effort to extend bush tax cuts would double deficit
what he didn t say is that the democratic plan to extend taxes for percent of the population shoots almost as big a hole in the budget as the republican plan
the democratic tax plan would leave a projected deficit in that would be roughly to as high as that caused by the gop plan to eliminate all the levies according to the same cbo report cited by kaine
