"Obamacare will provide coverage for abortions, despite the presidentâ€™s commitment that it would not."
m ost disturbing is the fact that obamacare will provide coverage for abortions despite the president s commitment that it would not handel a republican wrote on page of the book
as for whether the president had committed to prohibiting abortion coverage in the health care law that part is clearer
obama did say and signed an executive order that committed to no federal funding for abortion in the health care law
handel s claim that the law will provide coverage for abortions could have been made more precisely
obama signed an executive order in the health care law including language from the amendment stating federal funds are not used for abortion services except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the woman would be endangered
