we got a national guard troop request that been in front of this president for over a year and no response so we are forced by washington inaction to take action ourselves
to reiterate my standing request with your administration i respectfully ask that you authorize the use of title national guard personnel in support of civilian law enforcement along the border
what does he anticipate the guard doing and those are the kinds of things that i think then i will transmit to the secretary of defense and the president in the ongoing decision about guard yes no and if so how many and where
as we discussed during our telephone conversation an additional title national guard positions are needed
in an april letter to napolitano perry asked to discuss his request for national guard troops the letter also mentions the pair march phone conversation
