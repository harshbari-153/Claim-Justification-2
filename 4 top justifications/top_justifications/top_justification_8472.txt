"We have encountered the largest surge of migrants (at the southern border) in the last 20 years."
glenn grothman tweeted we have encountered the largest surge of migrants in the last years there is a crisis at the border
is now seeing the largest surge of migrants since
grothman claimed we have encountered the largest surge of migrants in the last years
so that s not helpful in terms of getting to the bottom of the claim that this has been the largest surge of migrants in the last years
but in the speech grothman did not reference whether the surge of migrants approaching the southern border was the largest in the last years
