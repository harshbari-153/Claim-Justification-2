"The Taliban has been there for years and years, I mean, hundreds of thousands of years."
i think it very very important to understand that the taliban has been there for years and years i mean hundreds of thousands of years
he could have just stopped after saying that the taliban has been there for years and years rather than adding i mean hundreds of thousands of years
for this we wanted to check meek statement that the taliban has been in afghanistan for hundreds of thousands of years
meek claims taliban have been in afghanistan for hundreds of thousands of years
but we were still curious about how long the taliban had been around
