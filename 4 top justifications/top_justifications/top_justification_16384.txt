"Raising taxes on investment income has actually lowered the revenue received from the tax, while cutting capital gains tax rates has increased revenue."
history shows that raising taxes on investment income has actually lowered the revenue received from the tax while cutting capital gains tax rates has increased revenue
jim renacci says raising the capital gains tax has lowered revenue while cutting it has increased revenue
the relationship between capital gains taxes and revenues has been studied extensively by economists he said and most studies find that higher rates reduce realizations of gains but that does not mean they cut revenues
the cbo study found that a cut in the capital gains rate will tend to spike tax revenues but only temporarily
renacci cited three sources in support of his statement that raising the tax rate on capital gains lowers tax receipts while cutting taxes raises money
