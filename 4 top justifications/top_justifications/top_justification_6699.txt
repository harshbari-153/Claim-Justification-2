"U.S. military at the White House arresting Congress."
military at the white house arresting congress
breaking us military at the white house arresting congress was the headline posted jan
leaving aside why the military would go to the white house to arrest congress the claim lacks any truth
us military arresting congress that s pants on fire ridiculous
it goes without saying that an arrest of even one member of the house or senate by the military would have made major news
