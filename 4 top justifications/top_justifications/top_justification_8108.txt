"If Obamacare is fully implemented, 30 million people will still be without health insurance."
if obamacare is fully implemented million people will still be without health insurance gibbs tweeted
we decided to check out gibbs claim that so many people would still be without health insurance after the bill is fully implemented
gibbs statement that million people will be uninsured after the health care law s full implementation is close to the cbo s latest estimate but it ignores a key fact the number of people without insurance would be much higher without the law
a widely circulated cbo report from last summer said the aca in comparison with prior law before the enactment of the aca will reduce the number of nonelderly people without health insurance coverage by million in and by million or million in the latter part of the coming decade leaving million nonelderly residents uninsured by the end of the period
in the next years million nonelderly people who don t have insurance now would gain insurance under the bill
