"The benefits that were offered to me as a congressman don’t even compare to the benefits that you get as a state employee. I just experienced that myself. They’re not nearly as good."
but one comment caught our attention the benefits that were offered to me as a congressman don t even compare to the benefits that you get as a state employee said duffy
he said the federal benefits don t even compare and are nearly as good
federal benefits
duffy later said his words were poorly chosen and his staff says he was just expressing his feelings on the transition from state to federal employee not complaining about his pay
but we found a far less significant gap and some federal advantages on retirement benefits
