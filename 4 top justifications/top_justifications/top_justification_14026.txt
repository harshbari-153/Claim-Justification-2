Says Madison and Milwaukee County both carry sanctuary status for illegal immigrants and released undocumented immigrants who have committed multiple crimes including sexual assault of a child
to break it down trump essentially claims madison and milwaukee county both carry sanctuary status for illegal immigrants and have released undocumented immigrants who have committed multiple crimes including sexual assault of a child
do madison and milwaukee county carry sanctuary status which means they don t comply with federal actions to track down undocumented immigrants
of course a key part of the claim is that milwaukee county and madison have adopted sanctuary status
though milwaukee and madison officials don t identify their cities as being sanctuary they do practice immigration protection in a way that may fit that meaning
last year the sanctuary county of milwaukee released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child
