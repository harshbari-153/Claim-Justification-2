if i have affordable coverage in my workplace i not eligible to go into the marketplace
it s illegal she said
it s pretty clear sebelius was wrong when she said it s illegal for her to buy insurance on the exchange because she already has affordable insurance through her employer
hhs secretary kathleen sebelius says illegal for her to use the health insurance exchange
individuals who have health insurance through their employer can sign up for the online marketplaces it s just not financially beneficial for most to do so
