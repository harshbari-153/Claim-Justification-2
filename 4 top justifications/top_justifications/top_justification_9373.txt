Says Joe Biden plagiarized Donald Trump in his Democratic National Convention speech.
a post on facebook that claimed joe biden plagiarized president donald trump was published nov
we rate the claim that biden plagiarized trump false
invoking plagiarism the post claims joe biden s speech stolen from trump we found no similar passages from biden s speech originating in a trump speech
no biden didn t plagiarize donald trump
biden has come under scrutiny in the past for plagiarism the act of stealing or passing off someone else s words or ideas as your own but we didn t find anything to support he lifted lines from trump for his dnc speech
