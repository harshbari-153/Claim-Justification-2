"The Fed created $15 trillion in the bailout process" and $5 trillion went overseas.
did the fed create trillion during the bailout and send trillion overseas
he backed up this point by saying the fed created trillion dollars in the bailout process
our ruling apart from anything paul said it is true that the fed has created about trillion
it s incorrect to say the fed created trillion because that s a running total of lending and the running total ignores a key reality
between december and july more than trillion passed from the fed to the biggest banks both domestic banks and subsidiaries of institutions
