"Thereâ€™s been no" TV commercials for the COVID-19 vaccines because "they are required by law to list all adverse side effects."
an instagram post claimed there s been no tv commercials for the vaccines because they are required by law to list all adverse side effects
because in the us they are required by law to list all adverse side effects to medications advertised on tv to consumers
but one instagram post claims that drug makers aren t doing tv ads for their own vaccines because they would have to list the possible side effects
there have been many tv ads promoting vaccination generally
the vaccine manufacturers have been kept from advertising their vaccines because fda rules don t allow advertising for drugs that have only emergency use authorization and not full fda approval
