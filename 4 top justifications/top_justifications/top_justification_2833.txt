"Obama ordered CIA to train ISIS Jihadists"
the headline said obama ordered cia to train isis jihadists
obama ordered cia to train isis jihadists reads the headline
a blog post from five years ago that claims president barack obama ordered the cia to train members of isis continues to circulate on the internet despite the fact that it severely mischaracterizes the intent and outcome of a cia operation
on top of falsely alleging that obama ordered the cia to intentionally train members of isis the post claims the released document confirms the united states and its partners actually facilitated the rise of the islamic state of iraq and syria isis as an effective adversary against the government of the syrian dictator president bashar
despite what the post s headline says obama never ordered the cia to train members of isis
