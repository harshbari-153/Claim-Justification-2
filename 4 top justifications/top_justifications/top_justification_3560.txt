"Donald Trump authorized up to 20,000 National Guard troops to protect the Capitol" before Jan. 6, 2021, but was "rejected" by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.
hannity repeatedly claimed that trump authorized national guard troops for the capitol before the riot and that the former president s efforts to secure the building were thwarted by house speaker nancy pelosi
hannity said donald trump authorized up to national guard troops to protect the capitol before jan
no evidence pelosi rejected trump s authorization for national guard before attack
if donald trump authorized up to national guard troops to protect the capitol how does it make sense that they are there on national television blaming donald trump for wanting to start an insurrection hannity said on his june show
there was no evidence to support such a claim in february when trump said on fox news that he had requested national guard troops but was rebuffed by pelosi
