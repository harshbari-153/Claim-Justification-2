Says Joe Biden tweeted, "I have consulted with Instagram’s CEO to take the page @electionleaks down. They have supposedly ‘video proof’ of me using a hidden earpiece in tonight’s debate. This is slander, and not true."
i have consulted with instagram s ceo to take the page electionleaks down reads what looks like a tweet from biden that s being shared on instagram
biden didn t tweet this or wear an earpiece during the debate
the account posted a video of alleged proof that biden was wearing a wire during the debate
so is the claim that biden tweeted this
the biden campaign told us this isn t an authentic tweet
