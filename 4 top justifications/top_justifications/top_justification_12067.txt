cuccinelli said all the bills he s supported defining life as beginning at conception have contained language saying measures are intended to comply with supreme court rulings on abortion rights

the bill contained this clause the laws of this commonwealth shall be interpreted and construed to acknowledge on behalf of the unborn child at every stage of development all the rights privileges and immunities available to other persons citizens and residents of this commonwealth subject only to the constitution of the united states and decisional interpretations thereof by the united states supreme court and specific provisions to the contrary in the statutes and constitution of this commonwealth
