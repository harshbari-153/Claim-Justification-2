"Since 2000, only 10 cases of in-person voter fraud have been proven nationally."
voter fraud a very rare phenomenon
in an announcement about the news conference the naacp said that since only cases of voter fraud have been proven nationally
after compiling all the information into an election fraud database found that cases of other types of election fraud existed for every case of voter impersonation
opponents also say the voter id laws are unnecessary because the voter fraud used to justify the laws doesn t exist
but the rnla s own research alleging that more cases of fraud exist than the claim includes several other types of election fraud not just voter impersonation
