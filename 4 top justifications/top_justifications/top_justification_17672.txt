The health care plan for members of Congress "is no better than the janitor who cleans their offices."
obama answered that lawmakers get a good deal on health care but that their deal is no better than the janitor that cleans their offices because they are part of a federal employee plan
obama is right on federal health care for janitors and senators
why have you not used the bully pulpit to chastise congress for having two systems of health care one for all of us and one for them an audience member asked
an audience member asked president barack obama why members of congress have a different health care plan than the rest of us
we should note that while janitors and members of congress can choose from the same menu of plans members of congress generally have more money to spend on well anything
