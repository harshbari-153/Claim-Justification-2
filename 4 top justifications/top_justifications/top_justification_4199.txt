i think i received more votes in the democratic primary than any governor in history
but did he receive more votes in a democratic primary than any of his predecessors to evaluate his claim we researched democratic primary results in years where the winner went on to become governor
cuomo claimed he won more votes in a democratic primary than any other governor in the state s history
until the primary it had been decades since a democratic primary in which the winner went on to the governor s office
how did that compare with other democratic primaries
