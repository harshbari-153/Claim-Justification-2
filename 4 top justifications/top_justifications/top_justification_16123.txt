"Powerful Houston Democrats Sylvia Garcia (Democrat county commissioner in Harris County) and Elyse Lanie(r) (wife of the former liberal Democrat mayor Bob Lanier) sponsored a Democrat fundraiser for Speaker (Joe) Straus with numerous Democrat officials and high-ranking union officials."
while mayor of houston bob lanier was viewed as a democrat though the office is filled via elections
barton a former party vice chairman levels nearly charges in his letter including powerful houston democrats sylvia garcia democrat county commissioner in harris county and elyse lanier wife of the former liberal democrat mayor bob lanier sponsored a democrat fundraiser for speaker straus with numerous democrat officials and union officials
barton subsequently told us in an i knew several of the key democrats who put it together including the head of the union based in houston who was a principal in the event and i also heard about it from influential business leaders who were invited to the event by garcia and lanier
the may event at the lanier s home young said was a democrat ic fundraiser it was a bipartisan fundraiser
for instance it s fair to say the laniers sponsored the party
