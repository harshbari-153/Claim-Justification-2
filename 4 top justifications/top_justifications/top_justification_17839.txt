"Antifa now banging on residents’ doors in Seattle, demanding food & supplies. If they don’t get it, the house gets vandalized."
a june facebook post offers something new to worry about antifa now banging on residents doors in seattle demanding food supplies
no evidence antifa members vandalizing seattle homes that don t supply food
phillip tavel vice president of the morgan junction association told us he thought he could safely say that antifa is not going door to door in seattle threatening to vandalize houses that don t provide food and supplies
if they don t get it the house gets vandalized
he said it hasn t happened in west seattle where the neighborhood association is located nor has anyone he spoken to in other neighborhoods reported that kind of intimidation by antifa supporters
