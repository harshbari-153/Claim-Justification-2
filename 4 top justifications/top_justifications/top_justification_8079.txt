Says "Biden wants a nationwide lockdown to combat a virus that has a 99%+ survival rate."
in a tweet that became a viral instagram post paul said biden wants a nationwide lockdown to combat a virus that has a survival rate
biden said in august that he would support a national lockdown if scientists determined it was necessary to curb the disease
with coronavirus cases surging again in the united states all eyes are on joe biden who vowed to change the course of the country s pandemic response
while biden s earlier comments suggest he is open to seeking a lockdown if it s warranted he and his team have made it clear that they neither intend nor want to impose a national shutdown as paul claims
misinformation also muddied the waters viral posts circulated in october that falsely claimed biden pledged to lock down the nation until a vaccine is available
