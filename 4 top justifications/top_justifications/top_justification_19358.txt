Says MSNBC called the Florida governor’s race for Andrew Gillum before Election Day.
no msnbc did call the florida governor s for andrew gillum before election day
this was shown on msnbc last night calling the race for gillum
the post includes what looks like a still of a tv segment with photos of andrew gillum the democrat running for florida governor and ron desantis his republican opponent
though msnbc aired a graphic that looked like gillum won the tight gubernatorial race the network quickly said it was a mistake
msnbc on monday inadvertently aired what looked like live results of the heated gubernatorial election in florida a day before the actual voting
