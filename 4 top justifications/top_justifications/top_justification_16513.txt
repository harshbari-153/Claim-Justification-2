the north carolina law allows some officials similar to a justice of the peace to decline to administer any marriages if they have a sincerely held religious objection to marriage but they may not be selective and only marry couples
justices of the peace are not required to officiate marriages and do so mainly for their own benefit not as an integral duty of the job
