that would mean each of the volts sold would be subsidized between and depending on how many government subsidy milestones are reached
study from michigan s mackinac center for public policy which estimated that each of the volts sold up until that date has received between and in subsidies
six months ago volts had been sold and therefore the implied subsidy was per car half as many cars twice the subsidy per car
its analysis tallied up nearly billion worth of state and federal assistance it said were offered for the volt s development and production
