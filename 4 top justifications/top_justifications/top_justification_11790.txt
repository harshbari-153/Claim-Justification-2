Says Katie Porter is part of a "radical group of Democrats with an extreme agenda to abolish ICE."
the mailer from walters to residents of california s congressional district claims the press has reported that katie porter is part of a radical group of democrats running for congress and says she has an extreme agenda that supports abolishing ice
walters claimed that porter has an extreme liberal agenda that supports abolishing ice
mcclatchy reported that porter is part of a battery of even more liberal candidates pushing for health care and abolishing ice
for the purposes of this we focused on the claim that porter s agenda includes abolishing ice
perhaps a minor alteration in the story but it s a big hit on the accuracy of the mailer s claim that porter wants to abolish ice
