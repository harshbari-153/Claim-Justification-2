There are "500 failing schools in North Carolina"
it s hard to say exactly how many failing schools are in north carolina but we do know there are not like afp state director donald bryson said
how many schools are failing
in vouching for a law that would allow some struggling public schools to be taken over by charter schools the state chapter of the conservative group americans for prosperity said one in every five north carolina public schools is failing
any way you slice it there are clearly dozens and maybe hundreds of failing schools statewide
americans for prosperity exaggerates the number of failing schools in north carolina
