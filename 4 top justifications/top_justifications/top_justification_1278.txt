"Although the governor doubled the beach fees . . . all the money, as we found out, is all going to an out-of-state company. The state isn't even getting the money for that."
and then we learn this year that although the governor doubled the beach fees where i think it bucks if you from out of state and you want to go to a rhode island state beach on the weekend
the state is even getting the money for that
first of all the governor proposed the fee increase but he didn t do it on his own
beyond that point once in beach fees had been collected the state got cents of every dollar and propark got cents
the state got percent of that additional money
