"Under the ruling of the Supreme Court, any lobbyist could go into any legislator and say, if you don't vote our way on this bill, we're going to run a million-dollar campaign against you in your district."
under the ruling of the supreme court any lobbyist could go into any legislator and say you do vote our way on this bill we going to run a campaign against you in your district axelrod said
however the specific scenario axelrod cited that any lobbyist could go into any legislator and say if you do vote our way on this bill we going to run a campaign against you in your district could have happened before citizens united as well
second any corporation with enough resources in its pac could have threatened to run and run a campaign against a lawmaker in his or her district
axelrod says supreme court ruling enables lobbyists to threaten lawmakers
any lobbyist who was stupid enough to make such a threat would become persona non grata on capitol hill in oh about an hour after the threat was made
