"You lie!" (in response to President Obama saying health reform would not insure illegal immigrants.)
there are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants obama said
this was in response to president barack obama statements on illegal immigrants
obama said the reforms i m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally which wilson said was a lie
we do find the public option argument enough to make the case that obama lied
we read all pages of the health care bill and were struck by the fact that it is largely silent on health care for illegal immigrants
