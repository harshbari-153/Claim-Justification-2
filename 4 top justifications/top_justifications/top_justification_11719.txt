Says Neil Gorsuch "comes down on the side of felons over gun safety."
pelosi said gorsuch comes down on the side of felons over gun safety
pelosi s claim that gorsuch comes down on the side of felons over gun safety caught our attention
does neil gorsuch side with over gun safety as pelosi says
he said gorsuch is willing to bend over backwards to make rulings outside the mainstream opinion on the law banning felons from owning guns noting that it s important to consider whether gorsuch would advocate for criminal defendants rights in the same manner in cases that don t involve guns
but it s misleading to say gorsuch s past rulings demonstrate that he thinks more felons should be allowed guns than what is already permitted under the law
