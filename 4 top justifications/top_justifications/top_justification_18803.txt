Tim Kaine: "opposes everything President Trump does."
stewart says kaine opposes everything president trump does
kaine doesn t oppose every trump action
he opposes everything president trump does stewart said during a july debate with kaine in hot springs va
kaine during the debate didn t put up a fight when stewart said he opposes everything trump does
but stewart s larger context that kaine fundamentally disagrees with trump is correct
