"McDonaldâ€™s (makes) you all sign noncompete contracts that you cannot go across town to try to get a job at Burger King."
they ve made you all sign noncompete contracts that you can not go across town to try to get a job at burger king
biden said mcdonald s workers sign employment contracts with language that blocks them for working for a competing fast food chain such as burger king
biden said that mcdonald s workers sign a noncompete agreement that bars them from taking a better paying job with a competing chain
line employees at mcdonald s franchises don t command high wages but biden was wrong about the use of noncompete contracts
until three years ago mcdonald s did have a clause in its franchise agreements between the corporation and local owners that blocked them from hiring away staff from each other
