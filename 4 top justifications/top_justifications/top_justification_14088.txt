Says "47 additional counties used the same software that caused a ‘glitch’ in Antrim County (that switched 6,000 votes from Trump to Biden in that county)" and votes in the state are "potentially fraudulent."
michigan resident ted nugent said in a facebook post that additional counties used the same voting software that caused a glitch in antrim county and said that votes in the state are potentially fraudulent
our mi secretary of state is about to certify our votes in just a couple days by the once the votes are certified they can not be audited for fraud additional counties used the same software that caused a glitch in antrim county that switched votes from trump to biden in that county
nugent s post contains an element of truth dominion voting systems was used in several michigan counties and in antrim which experienced an incorrect early tally in favor of biden but it ignores the critical fact that the glitch was a human error limited to that county and that the technology itself didn t simply switch votes
and while antrim county discovered an incorrect tally that made it appear as if biden was winning there by about votes it was the only county to experience such an incident
as a result those machines failed to properly match votes to candidates when tallies at some precincts were added to the county total
