The United States' southern border is "basically open" and is "a super spreader event."
if you ve been following the news you know that our southern borders texas arizona southern parts of california are basically open sides said about hour and minutes into this video adding later if this isn t a super spreader event i don t know what is
sides said the border is basically open and causing a super spreader event also casting immigrants as a key reason covid cases are rising
sides said the border is basically open
sides said biden s immigration policy is a super spreader event
border encounters have skyrocketed since january but it s inaccurate for sides to say they re basically open
