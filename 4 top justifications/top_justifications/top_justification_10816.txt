Facebook users can avoid "problems with your Facebook going against community standards" by changing your settings.
go to your settings then scroll down to blocking type in community standards after that you should have anymore problems with your facebook going against community standards
don t waste your time you can t block facebook s community standards
there is not an official page group or account for facebook s community standards which all users must agree to before using the platform
if users violate facebook s community standards the platform may remove the offending post apply a warning label or disable the account that posted it
even though we had blocked the community standards account facebook still automatically enforced its rules against false news
