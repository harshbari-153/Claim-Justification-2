College tuition "costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats."
tuition costs have increased percent under obama and the democrats and total student debt has reached a trillion dollars
while it s clear that the ad is saying that costs have risen by percent under the democrats it s less clear whether the costs in question are tuition alone or tuition plus room and board
our ruling the ad claims that costs have risen by percent under the democrats
mitt romney in ad says college costs are up percent under barack obama
it s true that the published costs for one type of college and one type of student have risen by percent since obama took office but other data shows a smaller rise for tuition and fees particularly when inflation is taken into account
