Says Burisma admitted in a Ukrainian court to paying Joe Biden $900,000.
no evidence that burisma admitted paying joe biden
told fox news sean hannity that burisma paid joe biden in consulting fees when he was vice president
we found no evidence that any such statement was made in court or any new evidence that joe biden got money from burisma
we ve extensively claims in the past concerning the bidens ties to burisma
however because this claim about payments to joe biden has resurfaced with a new setting this time allegedly in a ukrainian court of law we decided it was worth another look
