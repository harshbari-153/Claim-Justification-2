The Senate health care bill does not contain limits on medical malpractice lawsuits.
he said that the senate bill does not include limits on medical malpractice litigation and he is clearly correct
so democrats have not included medical malpractice limits in either the house or senate version of the bills
republicans have a lot of concerns about the senate health care bill and one of their biggest is that it does not include any language to rein in lawsuits against doctors
the house bill establishes an incentive for states to adopt alternatives to traditional malpractice lawsuits but those proposals can not include provisions to limit attorney fees or impose caps on damages
the senate bill includes nonbinding sense of the senate language on page that states should be encouraged to develop and test alternatives to the existing civil litigation system as a way of improving patient safety reducing medical errors encouraging the efficient resolution of disputes
