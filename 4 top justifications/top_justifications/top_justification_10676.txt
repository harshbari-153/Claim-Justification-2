The CNBC debate was supposed to be three hours, and he "renegotiated it down to two hours."
trump said the cnbc debate was supposed to be three hours and he renegotiated it down to two hours
everybody said it was going to be three hours including cnbc
specifically we write because the agenda sent to the campaigns recently by cnbc in partnership with the republican national committee rnc and reiterated on yesterday s call indicated that there would be two hours of debate time plus four commercial breaks lasting between two and four minutes each the letter said
trump played a role but not the sole role in negotiating the debate program down to two hours but the plans were for it to last around two hours and minutes not three hours or more
and in about two minutes i renegotiated it down to two hours so we could get the hell out of here
