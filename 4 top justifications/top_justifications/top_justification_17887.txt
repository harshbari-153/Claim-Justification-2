Says Pete Gallego "went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress."
the republican group says gallego went and lobbied after you fired him from congress
went and lobbied after you fired him from congress
republican group wrong that pete gallego turned around and became lobbyist
pete gallego is an experienced former legislator who had demonstrated exceptional ability at solving problems by finding solutions palatable to multiple factions of legislators both parties rural and urban reps business and environmental advocates etc
gallego might be in legal trouble if he went to lobby right away on washington s infamous k street where lobbying firms marshal forces
