Jerry Brown "gave California state employees collective bargaining powers" and "now, state employees can retire at 55 with much of their salary for life."
and it also true that under the current system state employees in california with years of service can retire at age and receive half their salary for life
now state employees can retire at with much of their salary for life
it was until that the state adopted a policy that allowed employees to retire five years earlier at age and get percent of their annual salary for each year of their employment
but the implication is that brown support of collective bargaining for state employees was responsible for a sweetheart pension deal that many now argue is unsustainable and poses one of the biggest threats to california future financial health
so what to rate the whitman ad claim that brown gave california state employees collective bargaining powers
