"For four days in Denver, the Democrats were afraid to use the words 'Islamic terrorism.'"
for four days in denver the democrats were afraid to use the words terrorism giuliani said referencing the democratic convention from aug
other democrats also discussed the terror threat and the attacks of sept
we wo go so far as to examine the state of the democrats emotions whether they were in fact afraid during their quadrennial conclave but we have reviewed the speeches delivered there to see how often the democrats discussed terrorism and it clear that giuliani is on shaky ground
but democrats did spend plenty of time discussing terrorism
dems discussed terrorism aplenty
