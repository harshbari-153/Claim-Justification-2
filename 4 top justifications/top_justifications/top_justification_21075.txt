Medicaid expansion "could cost the Commonwealth of Virginia over $1 billion a year..."
landes in a constituent survey said medicaid expansion could cost the commonwealth of virginia over billion per year
while expansion would enroll up to currently uninsured virginians in medicaid it could cost the commonwealth of virginia over billion per year forcing cuts to other key services like education mental health and public safety
landes claim medicaid expansion could cost virginia billion a year based on shaky assumption
dmas concluded that the savings would outweigh the costs of medicaid expansion through when virginia would see a million net gain from joining the program
for example virginia now covers all the costs of hospitalizing a state prisoner under medicaid expansion the federal government would pay percent of the bills
