The government is "going to have the right to get into your bank account with the health care bill and make transfers without you knowing it."
rush limbaugh says health care bill would allow government to make transfers in your bank account
the way limbaugh says it it sounds like the government would require this program that it would have the right to get into your account that the government could do it without your permission
so limbaugh is wrong that the bill would allow the government the right to get into your bank account
rush limbaugh continued to hammer the health care bill claiming ominously that it would allow government the right to get into your bank account
so in summary some of the experts we talked to said the wording of the bill is ambiguous enough to allow speculation like limbaugh that the government might be able to tap into an individual bank account to square health payments
