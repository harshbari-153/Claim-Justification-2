any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the supreme court expected this june
we were interested in tobin s assertion that any legislative action that is taken now by the general assembly might become completely null and void after the supreme court ruling on its two cases
supreme court in the two cases it is considering could nullify action by the rhode island legislature
but a decision granting marriage is under no threat of supreme court nullification and the only realistic threat of nullification is if rhode island keeps the law as it is
all said that passage of either rhode island bill would not be affected by a supreme court ruling
