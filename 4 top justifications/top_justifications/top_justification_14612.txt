Says under Mitt Romney, Massachusetts was 47th in job creation.
juli√°n castro says that under mitt romney massachusetts was in job creation
both times politifact rated the statement half true saying that massachusetts ranking was correct but that it was inaccurate to say romney was responsible
every way politifact sliced the jobs numbers massachusetts was
our ruling the ranking for massachusetts is right the implication that romney is solely to blame for the state s low standing does not hold up
this claim is one politifact has tackled before in similar forms obama campaign adviser david axelrod hung the jobless ranking on romney on june and on june
