"No other public or private business in America" except for the U.S. Postal Service must fund 100 percent of employee retirement and retirement health costs in advance.
it requires the postal service to do what s called prefund percent of the health benefits for its future retirees
this means there s no reason to go postal over the claim by bishop and others that no other public or private business in america except for the usps must fund percent of employee pension and retirement health costs in advance
it s therefore accurate that under the current retirement system no federal employer aside from the postal service must prefund percent of both its retiree health and pension benefits
is it true that no other public or private business in america must prefund percent of the costs of its retiree pension and health care benefits before we address this question we should note that the usps is a unique government organization
federal employers under the current retirement system all federal employers including the postal service must prefund their pension benefits
