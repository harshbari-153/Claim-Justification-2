Says a photo taken in England shows "thousands of English Trump supporters" celebrating the president’s visit.
the claim comes as several outlets reported that tens of thousands of people gathered in the streets of london to protest trump s visit
the caption says when covering president trump s trip to england why is it that every news channel is showing the same footage of trump protesters but not one will show the thousands who showed up in support well here is a photo of what english trump supporters look like
there were reportedly pockets of trump supporters in those crowds too but this photo being captioned as thousands of english trump supporters is incorrect
thanks to a photo on facebook and an inaccurate caption a large crowd of soccer fans in england were misidentified as thousands of english trump supporters
the parade pictured actually took place on june a day before trump arrived in the uk and was a celebration of liverpool football club s win over tottenham hotspur in the champions league final in madrid
