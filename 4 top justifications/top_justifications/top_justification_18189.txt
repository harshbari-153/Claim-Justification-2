"On the day that (the Republican) state leader resigned in disgrace, a â€˜Shred-It' truck rolled up to Republican headquarters."
for goodness sake on the day that their state leader resigned in disgrace a truck rolled up to republican headquarters
alan grayson said that on the day the state party chairman resigned a truck rolled up to republican headquarters
it was a quiet and somber day outside the republican party of florida headquarters the only noise was traffic and the sound of a paper shredding truck
so we settled on grayson accusation that on the day former republican party of florida chairman jim greer resigned a truck was spotted at the party headquarters
on the day he resigned reporters working in tallahassee did notice a white truck parked outside rpof headquarters
