"Less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops, but 41 percent are on welfare."
one of them was less than percent of illegals are picking crops but percent are on welfare
facebook post says less than percent of illegals are picking crops but percent are on welfare
our ruling the facebook post s first claim that less than percent of illegals are picking crops is close to correct
so we think that saying that less than percent of illegals are picking crops is reasonably accurate
percent of illegal immigrants are on welfare this half of the statement is more problematic
