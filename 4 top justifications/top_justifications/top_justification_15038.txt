"John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie...but Democrats blocked the reforms."
john mccain fought to rein in fannie and freddie
does mccain support for that bill amount to fighting to rein in freddie and fannie sort of
the mccain campaign has also noted that in he was one of five republican senators to a prior bill to tighten oversight of fannie and freddie
mccain overstates his role in pushing for fannie and freddie reform and slightly oversimplifies the dynamic at work in the senate
did democrats block the reforms more or less
