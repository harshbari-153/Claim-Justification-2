"There are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips" because of sequestration.
our ruling duncan said that because of the threat of sequestration there are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips
there are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips who are getting notices that they ca come back this fall duncan said on face the nation on feb
but does that mean teachers are literally getting pink slips districts under fire if you read your local newspaper you re probably already aware that school districts have been in a financial bind for several years largely due to the recession
that conjures images of hundreds or even thousands of teachers who have already been fired
and officials there provide a contradictory explanation for why teachers are being notified their jobs might be transferred and eventually eliminated
