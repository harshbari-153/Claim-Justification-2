Judithanne McLauchlan "was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on Floridians."
the state gop said mclauchlan was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on floridians
the ad which features actors pretending to be students being quizzed by a teacher says mclauchlan was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on floridians
state gop tries to equate judithanne mclauchlan with a state income tax
accusing an opponent of wanting to raise taxes is political campaigning but did mclauchlan really associate with people who wanted to tax floridians at a state level
so where did brandes and the state gop get the notion about a state income tax if you look at the fine print it reads that mclauchlan served on board of directors of league of women voters
