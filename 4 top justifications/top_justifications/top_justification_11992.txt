"A government panel that didn't include cancer specialists says women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50...If government takes over health care, recommendations like these could become the law for all kinds of diseases."
now a government panel that did include cancer specialists says women should receive mammograms until age
first and foremost the task force did not say women should receive mammograms until age
to review the task force did not say women should receive mammograms until age
the report found there was insufficient backing to support the idea that routine mammograms should be automatic for all women to but it noted that there were many women for whom they would be appropriate and that the decision to start regular biennial screening mammography before the age of years should be an individual one and take patient context into account including the patient values regarding specific benefits and harms
and if all that were enough legislators went out of their way to ensure that mammograms for women aged to would be covered
