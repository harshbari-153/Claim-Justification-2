Says Wisconsinâ€™s in-person election has caused a "surge" in new coronavirus cases
an article shared widely on facebook claimed on april that wisconsin coronavirus cases had surged as a result of the election
new virus cases surge in wisconsin a week after republicans forced election to go forward
the truth is at the time of the second nexus article and this one it s too soon to say what impact the election had on wisconsin s coronavirus outbreak
