Says the surge in COVID-19 cases is caused by "antibody mediated viral enhancement" from the COVID-19 vaccines.
a doctor in a viral video says the surge in cases is caused by antibody mediated viral enhancement from the vaccines
in a video from a school board meeting gone viral an indiana family doctor claims that this summer s surge in cases is caused by vaccines
the reason for the new outbreaks is the delta variant is much more contagious so it is spreading like wildfire in unvaccinated individuals not in vaccinated people
enhancement as it is more commonly known is a real but rare phenomenon in which people who are vaccinated can experience more severe symptoms if they are later infected by a virus
we also have evidence that the delta variant is more likely to spread in communities with low vaccination rates which provides additional proof that vaccines are not enhancing virus spread but are actually slowing it down
