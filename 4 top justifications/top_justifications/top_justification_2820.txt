"John Kerry was at 4 percent in the polls in December of 2003...and he ended up becoming the nominee of the party."
indeed there were four polls showing kerry at that level
john kerry was at percent in the polls in december of two points behind al sharpton and points behind howard dean
but other polls that same month showed kerry with more support
dodd is not only understating kerry strength in the polls but overstating his own
dodd biggest stretch is his attempt to liken his poll standing to kerry
