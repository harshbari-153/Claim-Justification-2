dave aronberg a democratic candidate for attorney general said in a campaign mailer that hit mailboxes this week that he was the first to demand that bp create a fund to pay for the devastation
so we wondered was aronberg the first to call for bp to pay for a billion escrow account first we contacted aronberg campaign to ask what he meant by first since the ad did explain
dave aronberg says he was to demand bp escrow fund
aronberg said he was the first to call for a billion escrow fund but did define first although his campaign said that meant first state legislator or cabinet member
when we searched news articles we found only one reference to a florida politician asking for bp to provide an escrow fund before aronberg republican congressman jeff miller who represents the pensacola area
