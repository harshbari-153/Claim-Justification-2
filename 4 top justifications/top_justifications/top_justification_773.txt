Says Dino Rossi "stripped" health care "from 45,000 children."
did dino rossi take away health care coverage from children
the ad said rossi stripped health care from children
he went to work health care stripped from children
one proposed by rossi was a million cut in medicaid spending
so it seems like the hca is saying that that was a combination of families who were making enough money to afford healthcare themselves moved off of medicaid coverage and a reduction in wealthy families who were cheating the system and taking health care from poorer families bell said
