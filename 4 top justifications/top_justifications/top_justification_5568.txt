"Yale study: Vaccinated people more likely to be infected than those without the jab."
an instagram post by teens against mandates shows a headline that reads yale study vaccinated people more likely to be infected than those without the jab
nowhere does it suggest that vaccinated people are more likely to be infected than unvaccinated people
first vaccinated people may test more than unvaccinated people she said
an instagram post claimed that a yale study showed that vaccinated people are more likely to be infected with omicron than people who are not vaccinated
therefore there was likely an overrepresentation of vaccinated people
