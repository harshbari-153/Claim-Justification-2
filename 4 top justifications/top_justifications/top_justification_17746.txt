If African-Americans vote their percentage of the population in 2008, "Mississippi is suddenly a Democratic state."
if we just got in mississippi to vote their percentage of the population he said mississippi is suddenly a democratic state
in the presidential election blacks made up percent of the voters who turned out in mississippi where they comprise percent of the population
to begin with in mississippi and georgia already come close to voting their percentage of the population
then give him all of the black voters who would turn out if mississippi blacks voted their percentage of the population in
by itself black voter increase does not flip mississippi or the south
