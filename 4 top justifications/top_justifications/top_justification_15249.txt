"A major part" of the climate change bill sponsored by Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman "was essentially written by BP."
mcconnell says that climate bill written by bp
in fact many on the left not just conservatives like mcconnell are disappointed that kerry and other democratic supporters of climate change legislation worked with oil companies including bp while crafting the bill
but i do think it is accurate to say that bp essentially wrote a major part of the bill
but mcconnell went much further when he said that bp had essentially written a major part of the bill
on the one hand bp did have substantial input into the kerry bill said dan becker director of the safe climate campaign at the center for auto safety
