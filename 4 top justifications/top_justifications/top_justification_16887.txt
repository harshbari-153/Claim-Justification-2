Under a proposed medical marijuana amendment in Florida, "you don't get refills -- you get it forever."
miguel said when it comes to doctor s recommendations for medical marijuana you do get refills you get it forever
opponents have made many arguments against florida s proposed medical marijuana amendment but here s a new one they say patients would be able to get an unlimited amount of pot should the measure pass
medical marijuana amendment allows patient to it forever doctor says
politifact florida has written about the amendment s guidelines before but we were curious in this case whether doctors who recommend medical marijuana to patients would indeed have no say in how much or for how long their patients could take it
florida s amendment says that should the initiative pass the state department of health would create guidelines for the manufacture distribution and use of marijuana
