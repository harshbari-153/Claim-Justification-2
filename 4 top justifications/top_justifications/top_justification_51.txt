"By the time I finish this speech, two Americans will be slain, six women will be raped, 27 of us will be robbed, and 50 more will be beaten."
specifically lapierre said by the time i finish this speech two americans will be slain six women will be raped of us will be robbed and more will be beaten
a spokesman explained that the claim two americans will be slain during the speech had been calculated by adding the fbi figure for murder and manslaughter to the number killed in crashes in as reported by the national highway traffic safety administration
killings every minutes rapes
rounded up that equals two deaths during the period of the speech
using this number lapierre s number is more than twice the actual rate of americans who are slain
