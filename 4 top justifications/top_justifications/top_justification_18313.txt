A photograph shows KKK members marching at the 1924 Democratic National Convention.
during the convention klansmen attended a rally across the river in new jersey
though the democratic national convention did come to be known as the klanbake the photograph the facebook post alleges was taken there is actually a picture from several states away as klansmen walked to a funeral service
but did klansmen crowd the convention well there was a gathering of the kkk across the hudson river on the day of the political convention that year but this photo that making the rounds on social media is not from that event
reminder that the kkk democrats the post says at the bottom
no viral photo does not show the kkk at the democratic convention
