"The substitute budget now adds in tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy these prisons."
lundy is correct that the the substitute budget includes tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy the prisons
the substitute budget now adds in tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy these prisons lundy said
house finance chairman ron amstutz a wooster republican said the tax provisions were added to assure that the private buyer of the prisons would be treated like any other state entity since they will essentially be performing a state function by housing inmates
and lundy is correct that the tax breaks and deductions in the budget bill were added in by the house
if the private entities were to pay these particular taxes which go back to supporting the local communities where the facilities are located then basically the state taxpayers would be subsidizing the local taxpayers at that point for a state function and typically we don t do that amstutz explained
