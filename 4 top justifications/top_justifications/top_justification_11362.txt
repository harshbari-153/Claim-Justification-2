"Democrats are kind of falling over each other seeing who can raise taxes faster. It looks like they're going to raise taxes anywhere between 20 to 30 percent."
either way giuliani is correct that democrats are open to letting some of the tax cuts of expire which would raise taxes for those affected
first of all the democrats are advocating the elimination of all of the tax cuts
and second the logic of the giuliani argument is that a rise in revenues is the same as a tax increase
but they also have indicated that they would favor allowing tax cuts to expire that in their view unfairly benefit wealthy americans
the tax rate on household incomes above would return to higher levels as would taxes on capital gains dividends and estates
