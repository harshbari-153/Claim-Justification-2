The lack of an automatic braking system that could have prevented the Philadelphia Amtrak crash "wasn't driven by a lack of funding. It just takes a while. They (Congress) just passed it in the recent past."
kelly said that the lack of a working braking system at the site of the philadelphia amtrak crash was driven by a lack of funding
the braking system and and the amtrak crash
while a technology called positive train control ptc could have slowed the train in the case of human error its absence in the philadelphia crash kelly said had nothing to do with congress refusing to allocate money
clearly amtrak had internal problems managing its capital projects including the system that could have prevented the fatal crash near philadelphia
what we found is that yes amtrak and congress have been working for years to implement positive train control
