Says TriMet spends "$10.3 million in police contracts" a year for 56 transit police who must respond to non-transit calls
does trimet spend million a year for transit police to respond to calls
does trimet pay million a year for transit officers who respond to calls and aren t around much
in other words we re sure trimet has way more problems to worry about than a mere million transit police contract out of a million operating budget for fiscal year which starts july
million a year for transit police who are rarely around
we have no idea if that s a fair accusation although trimet says transit police spend at least percent of their contracted time on transit related matters
