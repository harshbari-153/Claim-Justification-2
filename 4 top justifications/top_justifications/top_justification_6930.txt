"Mr. Renacci was registered as a foreign trade lobbyist in the United States government."
renacci was registered as a foreign trade lobbyist in the united states government
so yes renacci is registered as a lobbyist and his fledgling firm said on its registration form that it intended to lobby on trade
so what is up you might ask with this criticism of an opponent by john boccieri a democratic incumbent in ohio s congressional district he accuses republican challenger jim renacci of registering as a foreign trade lobbyist as if that were disgraceful
john boccieri portrays challenger jim renacci as a menacing trade lobbyist
we looked up some of these filings in the senate and found that some have lobbied on trade matters
