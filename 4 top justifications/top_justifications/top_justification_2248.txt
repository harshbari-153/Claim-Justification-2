carson said that yuma county has been able to reduce illegal immigration by percent but that the federal programs that allowed them to do that had been abolished
as we reviewed statistics about border apprehensions we did find a precipitous drop in immigration for yuma county but it took place over at least a decade

a report from the congressional research service the nonpartisan research arm of congress documented the decreases at yuma and in other places since it noted that pinning down the precise causes of the decline in illegal immigration are difficult
