In Virginia, "the woman has the right to talk to the doctor whoâ€™s going to perform the abortion and (Democrats) wanted to strip that out."
thomas said a virginia woman has the right to talk to the doctor who s going to perform the abortion and democrats wanted to strip that out
one the woman has a right to talk to the doctor who s going to perform the abortion and democrats wanted to strip that out thomas said
there s been a lot of partisan debate on this bill but we hadn t heard anyone say it would have deprived a woman of the her right to talk to the physician who was going to carry out her abortion
we asked thomas to back his claim that the bill also would have rescinded a woman s right to talk to the doctor who s going to perform the abortion
the bill would not have tinkered with a woman s right to choose a doctor who would speak to her before performing an abortion
