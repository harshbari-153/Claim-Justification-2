The migration of Hondurans toward the United States "was funded by Democrat activists."
so far we have seen any hard facts to back up the assertion that the migration was funded by democrat activists
thus the claim that the honduran exodus was funded by democrat activists is all talk and no walk
some of the argument in favor of the migrant march being funded by democrats seems to be completely made up while some is based on video footage that falls short of qualifying as evidence
the people trying to make their way to the united border a trek that originated with a smaller group from honduras continues to be the source of misinformation
it reads over hondurans are now headed to our border with camera crews and support vehicles two weeks before the midterm elections
