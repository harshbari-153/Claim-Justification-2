Says "Bush Jr. handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit" and Obama "reduced Bush Jr.â€™s deficit to just $492 billion."
trillion deficit and obama reduced bush jr
trillion deficit and obama reduced bush s deficit to just billion
in fact in terms of reducing the deficit obama did a little better than the meme said
in addition while deficits have fallen under obama the claim brushes over that deficits remained above the trillion dollar mark for several years long after bush left office
liberal group blames bush for raising deficits credits obama for lowering them
