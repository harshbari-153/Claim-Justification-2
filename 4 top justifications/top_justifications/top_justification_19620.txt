"Three of our cities are among the top five worst cities in the U.S. for asthma."
lamar alexander says three tennessee cities among worst five in nation for asthma
at a congressional field hearing of the house oversight and government reforms committee in murfreesboro alexander also claimed that one result of dirty air is that in tennessee three of our cities are among the top five worst cities in the u
our ruling alexander wasn t saying dirty air was the only reason tennessee cities rank high on a list showing the most challenging cities in the country for asthma just that the nation s state placed three of its cities in the top five of those rankings
it s important to note that the aafa emphasizes the rankings are an attempt to measure which cities are more challenging places to live for asthma sufferers not necessarily just a listing of places with the highest prevalence of people suffering with asthma
alexander s office said he was referring to the asthma capitals rankings released in may by the asthma and allergy foundation of america aafa
