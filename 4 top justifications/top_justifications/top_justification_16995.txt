Republicans "nominated the 1st Black woman to the SCOTUS & she was BLOCKED & filibustered byâ€¦ Joe Biden."
remember when the republicans nominated the black woman to the scotus she was blocked and filibustered by joe biden one march facebook post said
it was republicans who nominated the black woman to the scotus she was blocked filibustered wait for biden
a facebook post says republicans nominated the black woman to the scotus she was blocked and filibustered by joe biden
biden was also among senate democrats who filibustered brown s nomination to a federal appeals court
she was considered enough of a candidate that biden said she would probably be filibustered if bush did tap her for the court
