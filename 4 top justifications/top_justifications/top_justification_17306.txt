The minimum wage "in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office."
obama said the minimum wage in real terms right now is below where it was when harry truman was in office
so in which was during truman s time in office the minimum wage was
ultimately during seven out of the eight calendar years when truman was in office the minimum wage was lower than it is today not higher
in fact you could just as easily say that the minimum wage is higher today than it was under truman and that would be correct for seven out of the eight years he was in office
it well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real terms right now is below where it was when harry truman was in office obama said in an address at the center for american progress a liberal think tank
