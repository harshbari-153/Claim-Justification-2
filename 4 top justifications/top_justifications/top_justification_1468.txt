Under Florida’s voting law, a requirement to turn in voter registrations within 48 hours "makes it impossible to meet the deadline if you’re working right to the end of the week."
but matthews said that florida s voting law made it impossible for groups to register voters on friday afternoon because a deadline to turn in those applications would expire before the elections office opens monday morning
from there matthews dressed down curry saying the law makes it impossible in some cases for voter registration groups to meet that deadline
the rule basically makes it impossible to meet the deadline if you re working right to the end of the week right lenny curry the law was written to ensure that we have controls and processes in place to ensure the integrity of the vote
after the law s passage the league of women voters said they wouldn t conduct their usual voter registration drives because the new requirements were too difficult to meet
the bill does indeed create a deadline for voter groups to turn in completed registrations
