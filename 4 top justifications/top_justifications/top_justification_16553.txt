Says Ohio's Issue 2 will create a redistricting commission that will "have a blank check to spend our money."
ohio republican party says issue would create a redistricting commission with a blank check to spend
even if most voters don t take the ohio republican party s statement to mean an actual blank check would be presented to the redistricting commission the phrase blank check does presume an unchecked spending authority
so where does that leave us issue would provide the redistricting commission with funds necessary to adequately fund the activities of the commission
with a warning about the redistricting commission that issue would establish
that sounds similar to the ohio gop s claim that the commission would have a blank check
