"Obama has proposed 442 tax hikes since taking office."
americans for tax reform said that obama has proposed tax hikes since taking office
obama has proposed tax hikes since taking office said americans for tax reform in an april press release
indeed we track campaign promises from obama on the topic of taxes a group that includes proposed tax hikes as well as proposed tax breaks
obama has proposed tax hikes says group
obama did propose these measures multiple times but it is misleading to count each time he included a measure in his budget as a newly proposed tax increase
