Says Joe Biden hasnâ€™t admitted he was wrong on the Iraq War, as he did with the Hyde Amendment.
moulton said biden hasn t admitted he was wrong on the iraq war
seth moulton partly right on biden not admitting he was wrong on the iraq war
it is fair to say that biden never said that it was wrong to go into iraq under any circumstances
as for biden s vote for a resolution that cleared the way for the iraq war he called it a mistake but without admitting he was wrong
moulton says that biden admitted he was wrong about the hyde amendment
