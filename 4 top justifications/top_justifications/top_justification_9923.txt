President Joe Biden gave Congress an exemption from vaccine mandate
a facebook post says that biden gave an exemption to his vaccine mandate to members of congress
biden didn t exempt congress from vaccine mandate he simply lacks authority to include them
biden did not have the authority to mandate vaccines for members of congress
while the question of whether biden s vaccine mandate for federal workers and contractors can be enforced is for the courts to ultimately decide the question of why members of congress are exempt is a simple one biden doesn t have the authority to impose a vaccine mandate on them
since president joe biden first issued an executive order in september requiring federal workers to be vaccinated against some have expressed outrage at what they wrongly assumed was an exemption given to elected officials
