The state of New York is the "worst in the nation in economic recovery."
astorino said that new york state is the worst in the nation in economic recovery
we decided to check whether astorino was correct that new york is worst in the nation in economic recovery
rob astorino gop challenger to andrew cuomo says new york had worst recovery from recession
there certainly evidence that upstate new york is struggling for instance moody has cited data that indicate a stalling economic recovery in upstate new york but given the available statistics it hard to do a national comparison to determine what region is faring the worst in the recovery
but we see no support for calling new york s economic performance worst in the nation
