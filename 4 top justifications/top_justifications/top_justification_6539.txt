"There are more job openings than there are people on unemployment" in Iowa.
there are more job openings than there are people on unemployment
more available jobs than people on unemployment to fill them yes that is what the iowa workforce development report from director beth townsend to reynolds states
after hearing about layoffs and job cuts the past year seeing that more people are seeking jobs in iowa than are taking unemployment benefits might surprise some
but the numbers back it up and both sides of the argument on what iowa should do about unemployment benefits do not dispute it
moreover she wrote iowa has more job openings that aren t on the iowaworks website
