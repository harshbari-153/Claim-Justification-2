Says congressional candidate Dino Rossi once suggested "the state build homes for unwed mothers."
the washington state democratic party said in a tweet that rossi suggested the state build homes for unwed mothers which sounds right out of the handmaid s tale
did washington state dino rossi really want new homes for unwed mothers
from suggesting the state build homes for unwed mothers that sound out of handmaid s tale
sometimes the statement comes back to mock him such as at a political event when peggy platt a seattle comedian said rossi supported choice but only two abstinence or a home for unwed mothers
but he did not actually suggest the state build homes for unwed mothers
