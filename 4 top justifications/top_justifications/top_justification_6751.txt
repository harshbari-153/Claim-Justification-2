Ben Unger supported a 15 percent property tax increase on Oregon seniors.
take a candidate s position on an issue and weed out the context so you end up with something like unger supported a percent property tax increase on oregon seniors as if he wanted to single out old folks for additional taxes
did ben unger want to stick a percent tax hike to seniors
voters need to know about unger past political work and his support for tax increases that are especially harmful to oregonians who are vulnerable
but if voters say yes to both tax increases one for school construction and renovation the other for school operations property tax bills inside the district already among the highest in the metro area will rise more than percent in a single year
and now back to the claim about property taxes and seniors
