Mitt Romney "says the Arizona immigration law should be a model for the nation."
barack obama says mitt romney calls arizona immigration law a model for the nation
romney has actually said while he was in arizona of course and i understand that he was basically maybe playing up to the arizona crowd he felt that sb which has made its way up to the supreme court of the united states and will be argued in april he believes that it should be the template it should be the model for united states immigration law not comprehensive immigration reform as the more responsible individuals in congress have been espousing for a number of years but an extreme version of an law passed by the arizona legislature
referring to mitt romney the presumptive republican presidential nominee obama continued my opponent says the arizona law should be a model for the nation
we wondered if obama journeyed backward by saying romney called the arizona immigration law a model for the nation which he also said later the same day at the austin music hall
now back to whether romney referred to the arizona law as a model
