"The pope and Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin all agree" on eliminating the "carried-interest" tax break.
baldwin said the pope and donald trump and tammy baldwin all agree on eliminating the tax break
do donald trump pope francis and tammy baldwin all agree on eliminating a tax break
but i do have to just say that i agree with you that when the pope and donald trump and tammy baldwin all agree on an important tax change maybe it should be getting swifter consideration than it has gotten to date
trump has called for ending the tax break for investment managers that baldwin is seeking to repeal with a bill she introduced
so baldwin is among a number of democrats seeking to repeal carried interest
