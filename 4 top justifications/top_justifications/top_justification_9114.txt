Nevada Republicans "didnâ€™t do one single thing to cut spending" in 2015.
tarkanian says that the legislature didn t do one single thing to cut spending in the face of historic tax increases
but to say lawmakers didn t do anything to address spending isn t accurate
he said republicans missed an opportunity to substantially restructure spending in areas like collective bargaining and the state s public employee retirement system pers
for the first time in years the republicans controlled the assembly state senate and governor office they did do one single thing to cut spending cut wasteful tax dollars that are being used and instead they raised taxes
the best i can say is that there were virtually no cuts to the largest drivers of state spending
