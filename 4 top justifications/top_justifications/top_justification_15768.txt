Says three Ukrainians recently captured on a West Texas ranch are among "individuals from countries that have strong terrorist ties being apprehended" near the stateâ€™s border with Mexico.
perry said three ukrainians recently captured on a west texas ranch are among individuals from countries that have strong terrorist ties being apprehended near the border with mexico
three men from ukraine
ukraine has terrorist ties
three men from ukraine were captured on a west texas ranch in june though perry had the wrong ranch and his date was off a bit after allegedly crossing the rio grande into texas
so perry was correct that three ukrainians were arrested on a west texas ranch though he had the wrong ranch and his time frame was slightly off
