Businesses "will be required to certify to the IRS – under penalty of perjury – that Obamacare was not a motivating factor" for cutting staff.
firms will be required to certify to the irs under penalty of perjury that obamacare was not a motivating factor in their staffing decisions stirewalt said
the reality is that the irs has yet to release the rule that lays out what will happen if a company tells the government it didn t lay workers off because of obamacare when in fact it did
stirewalt said that under penalty of perjury companies will need to tell the government that any downsizing they underwent was not due to obamacare
that s not quite as broad as stirewalt put it to avoid obamacare costs but the rule certainly is part of obamacare
that s an uncheckable theory but a reader on facebook asked us if we could test the specific claim that firms must tell the irs under penalty of perjury that they didn t fire workers simply to avoid paying for their health insurance
