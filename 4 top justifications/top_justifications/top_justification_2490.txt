Says a proposed change to Illinoisâ€™ gambling law would result in "lower taxes paid to the state and higher taxes paid" to Chicago from a city casino so that the total amount would be the same, but the city would get to "keep more of it."
speaking about a proposal to change the tax structure for a future chicago casino syverson said the plan would lower taxes paid by the casino to the state and increase the taxes it pays to the city so that the overall amount would be the same but chicago would keep more of it
would chicago s casino tax plan raise city s take
under this scenario chicago instead of chicago would be keeping about or of the revenue and the state would get half the amount of what every other casino in the state was paying
but in an interview conducted in shortly after the legislature s fall veto session a republican state lawmaker claimed chicago s proposal would actually raise the city s take of casino tax revenue while leaving the state with less cash for projects that could benefit communities across illinois
the amount of taxes would be the same but chicago wanted to keep more of it
