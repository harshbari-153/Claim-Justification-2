Says the federal government is supporting a study in Hawaii to "develop a menu for when we colonize Mars."
the study is to develop a menu for when we colonize mars
the government is paying for a study in hawaii in which people will prepare foods under conditions that simulate a mission to mars
even so we think paul was when he said its goal is to develop a menu for when we colonize mars
he exaggerates when he refers to colonizing mars since the project is a broader look a how astronauts would eat on visits
there could be better menu options once they land on mars however because the planet s gravity might allow them to cook
