Says Benito Mussolini "initiated a campaign to 'drenare la palude' ('drain the swamp') by firing more than 35,000 civil servants."
albright said mussolini initiated a campaign to la palude the swamp by firing more than civil servants
at the same time most of the experts we contacted agreed that mussolini didn t use the catchphrase drenare la palude or drain the swamp to refer to his metaphorical efforts
she wrote that mussolini used the phrase drain the swamp when he made moves to overhaul the country s unpopular government bureaucracy
so mussolini literally drained the swamps
we found that mussolini s government made a big point of draining literal swamps as public works projects and he did conduct mass firings of civil servants
