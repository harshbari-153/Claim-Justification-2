Says Chris Koster "opposes right-to-work efforts because he has taken $8 million from ‘union bosses.’"
so koster has received millions of dollars from unions and he opposes legislation
greitens said koster received million from unions and opposes legislation
greitens challenged koster on several of his policies and political history claiming that koster is a career politician who opposes efforts because he has taken million from union bosses
but greitens claim goes further and claims that koster opposes that legislation because of the union donations
we also wondered if koster as greitens said opposed efforts because of union campaign donations
