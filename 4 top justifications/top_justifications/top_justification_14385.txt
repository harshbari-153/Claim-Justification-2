"I introduced a bill that wouldâ€™ve helped stop the multimillion-dollar bonus packages that CEOs grab on their way out.. (McCain) opposed that idea."
but i sure wish he was talking the same way over a year ago when i introduced a bill that would ve helped stop the bonus packages that ceos grab on their way out the door
the only thing the obama campaign has to support its contention that mccain opposed obama executive pay bill is a remark in a news story from one of his to advisers about mccain general preference for remedies a remark made a full year after the obama bill was introduced
barack obama depicted john mccain as a recent convert on the issue of corporate accountability and took credit for introducing legislation last year that would have imposed some formal restraint on big bonuses and severance payments that corporations routinely award top executives
but as early as mccain criticized excessive executive pay packages in the wake of the accounting scandal at energy giant enron corp
they provided a copy of remarks mccain senior policy adviser douglas made to the wall street journal in april that the arizona senator opposes legislative or regulatory fixes for executive pay problems preferring intervention
