Under current policies, "we're going to reduce the overall debt of the United States by $3 trillion over the next 10 years."
durbin said that under current policies we going to reduce the overall debt of the united states by trillion over the next years
since president obama has been in office we reached the point we cutting the annual deficits in half and we going to reduce the overall debt of the united states by trillion over the next years
on first glance the data doesn t seem to back up the claim that the overall debt of the united states is poised to drop by trillion or even by a dime over the next decade
so again the future projection of debt is going up not down
by contrast in the report released a few weeks ago cbo projected that the debt level in would be trillion
