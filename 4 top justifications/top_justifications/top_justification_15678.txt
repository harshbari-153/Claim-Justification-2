senate has passed a budget in the last three years
that kind of plan is called a budget resolution and the senate hasn t passed one in more than three years
that act set limits on discretionary spending but it is missing other features of a budget resolution which is considered a budget plan under the official congressional budget process
with menendez voting yes the senate last passed a budget resolution on april for fiscal year
robert menendez says the budget control act is the federal budget
