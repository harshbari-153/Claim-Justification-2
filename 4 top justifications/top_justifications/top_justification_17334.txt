Says in U.S. Congress, members "donâ€™t even have to be on the floor for debates or votes."
in congress they do even have to be on the floor for debates or votes
we ve sat through enough congressional proceedings to know firsthand that house members are not always present during debates
so harwell is correct when she says that members of congress do have to be present for debates
often the only lawmakers in the house chamber during a floor debate are those representatives who are speaking on the issue or waiting to speak
in contrast to washington practice legislative committees in nashville do not meet when floor sessions are underway
