"You canâ€™t tell me they can (develop a safe vaccine) in eight to 10 months. Or a year. It takes more time than that."
in a speech detailing his distrust of scientists and the vaccine edming said you can t tell me they can develop a safe vaccine in eight to months
is it really not realistic to develop a safe vaccine in less than a year
there may be a vaccination that s for this but you can t tell me they can solve this in eight to months
defending edming s claim his staff pointed to a vaccine history website from the college of physicians of philadelphia that says vaccine development is a long complex process often lasting years
it has allowed for a vaccine to be developed and tested much more rapidly
