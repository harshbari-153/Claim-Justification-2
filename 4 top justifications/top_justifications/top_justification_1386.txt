An economics professor taught her students about socialism by "socialising grades" and failing all of them
the story ends with students slowly bringing the average down until to their great surprise all failed and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail
however a facebook post claiming an economics professor failed an entire class as part of an experiment in socialist grading sounds a little less realistic
an economics professor at a local college made a statement that she had never failed a single student before but had recently failed an entire class
that class had insisted that socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich a great equalizer
tale of professor who failed entire class is an parable
