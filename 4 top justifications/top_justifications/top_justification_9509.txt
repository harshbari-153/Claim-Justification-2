"We have a governor who's vetoed measures like increasing our minimum wage and restoring the earned income tax cut."
our ruling at a campaign rally for buono wisniewski said we have a governor who s vetoed measures like increasing our minimum wage and restoring the earned income tax cut
we have a governor who s vetoed measures like increasing our minimum wage and restoring the earned income tax cut wisniewski said eliciting boos from the crowd
so while it s correct the governor vetoed two bills to restore the earned income tax credit he also has offered at least two proposals that included increasing the tax credit
but the governor has offered alternatives to increase the minimum wage and restore the tax credit to its previous level
by different means christie has vetoed bills to raise the minimum wage and to increase the earned income tax credit after reducing that benefit in his first state budget
