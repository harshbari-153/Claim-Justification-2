every one was retired early because they told president obama things that he did want to hear
one of the things i would immediately do in addition to defeating them here at home is bring back the warrior class petraeus mcchrystal mattis keane flynn
fiorina might be pushing the point of whether obama himself didn t like what they had to say but two of the men mattis and flynn likely departed over policy differences published reporting shows
flynn was a key intelligence adviser to mcchrystal in afghanistan and iraq
