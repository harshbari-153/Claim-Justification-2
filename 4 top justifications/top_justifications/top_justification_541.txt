"You can be an NFL player with murder charges and not be suspended."
he tweeted you can be an nfl player with murder charges and not be suspended
trump claimed you can be an nfl player with murder charges and not be suspended
so while it s possible that a past player namely lewis has been charged with murder without being suspended it s not likely that would happen today
lewis was indeed arrested on murder charges and he was not suspended by the nfl
the nfl players association takes issue with this policy as it prevents players from team activities even though they may end up not guilty of their charges
