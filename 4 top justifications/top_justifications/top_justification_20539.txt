During the Reagan era, while productivity increased, "wages for working people remained frozen."
in this item we will look at moore claim in the movie that as productivity rose during the reagan years wages for working people remained frozen
michael moore claims in that during reagan years productivity went up while wages remained frozen
still adjusted for inflation and when looking at nonsupervisory production workers it true that during the reagan years productivity rose while wages remained frozen or even dipped slightly
but it was until reagan presidency that productivity began to quickly outpace wages
so compensation to employees even when adjusted for inflation grew during the reagan era
