The Capitol Police force is "going so far as to use paramilitary equipment" in dealing with singing protesters in Madison
larson said the capitol police force under walker is going so far as to use paramilitary equipment at daily singalong protests in madison
chris larson says capitol police are using paramilitary equipment against protesters
still they can also be used purely as communications devices as the capitol police in madison appear to be doing
but larson s line about paramilitary equipment employed by the capitol cops was a new one for us
but they also are used by a variety of agencies for communication and mass notification and capitol police appear to have used them predominantly if not almost exclusively to make sure protesters are clued in that arrests will follow if they don t disperse
