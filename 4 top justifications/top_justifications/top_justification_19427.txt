"I have never voted for a tax increase."
to top it off there this i have never voted for a tax increase rubio says on his campaign web site
though he claims to have never voted for a tax increase we found that he has several times
marco rubio says he never voted to increase taxes
but they were votes to raise taxes and he did say never
that a vote on the budget was a vote against tax cuts
