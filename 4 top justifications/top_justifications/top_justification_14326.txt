"The president released all of the oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve."
here s a portion of the exchange between schieffer and bachmann bachmann it s ironic and sad that the president released all of the oil from the strategic oil reserve because the president doesn t have an energy policy
it possible bachmann meant to say the president released oil or some oil from the reserve in which case she would have been accurate
michele bachmann says barack obama has released all of the oil from the strategic oil reserve
several readers asked us to check bachmann s statement that the president released all of the oil from the strategic oil reserve suggesting that bachmann was incorrect in using the word all to describe the release
on june the obama administration announced that it would release million barrels of oil from the reserve to offset the disruption in the oil supply caused by unrest in the middle east according to the energy department
