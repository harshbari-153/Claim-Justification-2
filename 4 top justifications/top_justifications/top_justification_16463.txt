Says Mitt Romney’s top five donors are Wall Street firms, while Barack Obama’s top five are technology companies and universities.
facebook post says romney top donors come from wall street obama from tech and academia
presumably the point of the post is that romney is tied to wall street interests whereas obama is tied to the technology and academic sectors
here s obama s top six
citigroup inc so five of the six top contributors to romney were identical on the two lists and the new addition was bank of america another financial institution
so what these lists show is not that google gave money to obama but that employees of google gave money of their own volition either directly or through a political action committee
