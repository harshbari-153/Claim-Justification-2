"Jeb Bush recently noted, Reagan himself would have been too moderate, too reasonable for today's GOP."
then again my friend jeb bush recently noted reagan himself would have been too moderate too reasonable for today gop
what s murky is whether bush said or suggested reagan would be too moderate and too reasonable for today gop
charlie crist says jeb bush said ronald reagan would have been too moderate too reasonable for today gop
we do know that bush has since distanced himself from the suggestion that reagan could not survive in today s republican party
ronald reagan would have based on his record of finding accommodation finding some degree of common ground similar to my dad they would have a hard time if you define the republican party and i don t as having an orthodoxy that doesn t allow for disagreement he said
