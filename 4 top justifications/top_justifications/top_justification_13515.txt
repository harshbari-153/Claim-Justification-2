"The truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop."
because the truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop
nelson is right when he says that oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world because the federal legislation doesn t now include any limits
the whole fervor behind drill baby drill was to reduce america s dependence on foreign oil right
while the bill contains no limits on where the oil can flow there have been limits placed on american oil previously
we examined the bill to see what would become of that newfound oil and found no restrictions on where it ends up
