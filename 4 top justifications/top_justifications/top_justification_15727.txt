clinton said i am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what i would do to defeat isis
and i am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what i would do to defeat isis
hillary clinton wrong to say she only candidate to lay out a plan to fight isis

while clinton s plan is more detailed by some measurements than those of other candidates at least seven other candidates in both parties have released plans for taking on isis
