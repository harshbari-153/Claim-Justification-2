Voter fraud provided "a portion" of the margin of victory of Democrat John Lehman over Republican Sen. Van Wanggaard in a state Senate recall election.
wisconsin robin vos says voter fraud accounted for a portion of lehman s victory margin over wanggaard in senate recall
our rating vos said voter fraud provided a portion of the difference in wanggaard s loss in a critical state senate recall election
unfortunately a portion of the vote was fraud vos said adding i m not sure the entire vote margin was
he told us that there could be fraud involved in the vote
even wanggaard in a july statement issued after the recall was completed stopped short of declaring that it was fraud anyone who argues that this recount was a waste of time or that we do not need voter id either wants to conceal these potential fraudulent activities or hasn t been paying attention
