Says "Kurt Schrader supports Obama’s sequester … but won’t cut $1.6 million to fund new video games."
is it true that schrader supports obama s sequester but refuses to cut
the nrcc s online ad states kurt schrader supports obama s sequester but won t cut
those were followed by a online banner ad that reads what kurt schrader supports obama s sequester but won t cut
kurt schrader supports billion sequester but wo cut million for video games
to single out schrader and other potentially vulnerable democrats as supporting the sequester ignores an awful lot of republicans who voted for the sequester bill and blames democrats for failing to vote for a replacement budget dictated by republicans
