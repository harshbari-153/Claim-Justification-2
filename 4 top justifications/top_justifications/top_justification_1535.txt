The Senate health care bill "would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage."
but we were intrigued by another criticism leveled by the wyoming senator that the senate bill would leave million people without insurance coverage
mike enzi says senate health care bill will leave million uninsured
a cbo analysis of the main republican health care plan which was put forward by house republican leader john boehner concluded it would reduce the number of uninsured by only about million people as opposed to million in the reid plan
the cbo report found that the senate bill was less effective in reducing the number of uninsured compared to the version of the health care bill that passed the house
while the senate version was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by million leaving million uninsured the house plan was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by about million leaving about million uninsured
