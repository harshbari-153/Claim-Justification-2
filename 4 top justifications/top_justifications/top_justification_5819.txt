"To use money from the TARP fund in the manner that is being discussed by the White House and congressional Democrats would be a violation of the law."
to use money from the tarp fund in the manner that is being discussed by the white house and congressional democrats would be a violation of the law and it would betray the trust of the american people
the tarp legislation actually rightly demanded that any money not used to purchase toxic assets in the bill be used to pay down the national debt pence said from the floor of the house on dec
does the law really bar congress from spending that tarp money on the kind of economic stimulus described by the president
so when obama says that he will use tarp money to pay down the deficit he is just saying that he does not intend to violate the law
pence is correct that there is a provision in tarp that prohibits the government from directly spending tarp funds on some of the programs obama outlined
