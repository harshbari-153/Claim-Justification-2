"There are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations."
neuenfeldt said there are not nor have there ever been any boycotts encouraged by our organizations
and neuenfeldt s statement was there are not nor have there ever been any boycotts encouraged by our organizations
a day later phil neuenfeldt president of the wisconsin responded with a statement that said in part we have no knowledge beyond assertions made to the media by the wisconsin grocers association of any such campaign but let be crystal clear there are not nor have there ever been any boycotts encouraged by our organizations
in fact there have been very few such boycotts
what s more the statement didn t apply only to organizing boycotts but encouraging them
