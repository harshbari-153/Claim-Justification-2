"Itâ€™s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care."
yoho said it s been proven over and over again medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care
with the affordable care act what s happened is all these people have been running to medicaid and it s been proven over and over again medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care he said in a march interview on pbs about a week and a half before the republicans canceled a vote on their health care plan
yoho spokesman brian kaveney walked back the congressman s statement somewhat when we asked for evidence that medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world
the study does not imply that medicaid is not important let alone that it has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world
yoho intended to argue that medicaid under the aca hasn t improved health outcomes
