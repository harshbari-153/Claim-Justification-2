There are "high administrative costs" when you donate to Haiti relief through the White House Web site.
on seemingly every white house web page that mentions haiti there is a link to the red cross or the haiti fund
gov be inefficient compared with donating directly to the red cross or some other charitable organization do high administrative costs happen when you donate through the government instead of helping the people displaced by the quake would the money instead be used to pay government salaries we started looking around and discovered this you never could actually donate through whitehouse
i mean the high administrative costs are actually when you donate through the government he said
if you want to donate above and beyond that go through a charity that constantly on the ground in haiti or the red cross if you want to go that route or whatever
i do know of a president ever who has asked people to donate to a relief effort through a white house web site
