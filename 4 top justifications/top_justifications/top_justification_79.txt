"I saw my father march with Martin Luther King."
nevertheless mitt romney statement that he saw his father march with martin luther king remains problematic at best
mitt romney who would have been in said recently i think the thing that relevant is that my dad was a champion in the civil rights movement that he aligned himself with martin luther king
mitt romney has said several times that he saw his father george romney march with the civil rights leader martin luther king jr
romney said it was a figure of speech and that he meant he was aware of his father marching with king
if he stopped at saying his father was a champion of the civil rights movement he would have been on solid ground
