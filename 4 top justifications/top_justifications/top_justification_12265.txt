Says Rep. Jon Runyan "voted to redefine rape."
shelley adler claims jon runyan voted to redefine rape
our ruling adler said runyan voted to redefine rape while listing the reasons we can t trust him to stand up for women
so adler is wrong to claim runyan voted to redefine rape
adler levies a hefty allegation against runyan in claiming he voted to redefine rape but it s just not true
but the charge against runyan which chris russell runyan s campaign spokesman called just plain despicable is even more misleading because when he cast a vote in favor of smith s bill the word forcible had been removed
