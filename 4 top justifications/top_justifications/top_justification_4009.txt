An independent payment advisory board created by in the health care reform law is "like a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare in order to pay for new government programs."
the ipab it says is a medicare irs with the power to cut medicare to pay for new government programs
the ad broadcast statewide made a series of claims about last year s health care law including one that takes aim at the independent payment advisory board which the law created to suggest ways to limit medicare s spending growth
but that does not make ipab board a medicare irs
plus association with spokesman pat boone says the ipab is like a medicare irs
the group behind the ad is so taken with the analogy that it has established a website devoted to that theme which claims ipab is in effect a kind of medicare irs that will cut payment rates to doctors and nursing homes
