"The death rate for fully vaccinated people is significantly higher than non-vaccinated [people]."
an instagram post claimed that the death rate for fully vaccinated people is significantly higher than people
however the post claims that the death rate for vaccinated people is greater than the death rate for unvaccinated people a number that experts say is difficult to quantify
no the death rate for vaccinated people is not higher than that of unvaccinated people
an instagram post deceptively uses cdc data on vaccine breakthrough infections to claim that the death rate for fully vaccinated people is significantly higher than people
so the vaccines are actually performing better in situations than expected in some regards according to the public health experts we interviewed
