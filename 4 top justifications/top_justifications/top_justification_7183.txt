"Itâ€™s highly unusual to have a Supreme Court confirmation in a presidential election year. The last one was 1940."
it s highly unusual to have a supreme court confirmation in a presidential election year
goodlatte said it s highly unusual to have a supreme court confirmation in a presidential election year
although goodlatte won t have a vote in the controversy we decided to his full statement that a presidential confirmation of a supreme court justice is rare and hasn t occurred since
clearly such confirmations are rare in modern times it s happened only once during the past presidential elections
so although there was action on supreme court seats in and it s accurate to say the senate did not confirm a justice during either election year
