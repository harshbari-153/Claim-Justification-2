Says "Marco Rubio didnâ€™t show up" for a vote on his own bill on sanctions against Hezbollah.
murphy s ad said that rubio didn t show up for a vote on his own bill on sanctions against hezbollah
but is murphy correct that marco rubio didn t show up for a vote on his own bill to tighten sanctions against hezbollah
experts in senate procedure said it s misleading for murphy to say that rubio didn t show up for the vote on his bill because it was not a formal vote in which all senators were supposed to be present so their individual votes could be recorded
rubio absence even for a bill that he sponsored strikes me as within the norm of senate practice
the ad starts with a narrator asking marco rubio how can you protect us when you fail to show up for work the ad then excerpts a ad that boasted rubio wrote the toughest sanctions on hezbollah ever passed
