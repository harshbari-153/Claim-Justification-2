Florida's legal challenge of the federal health care bill is "bipartisan."
florida bill mccollum says health care lawsuit is bipartisan
given how polarized the health care debate has become we wondered how bipartisan the suit truly was
mccollum who is running for governor claims that his constitutional challenge of the landmark health care bill passed by congress is a bipartisan effort
to help make the point mccollum says the suit filed in a pensacola federal court on march is bipartisan
there is no hard and fast definition of bipartisan but it quite a stretch to say one out of is bipartisan
