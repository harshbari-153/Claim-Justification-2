"The costs for families (in the individual market) for the same type of coverage that they're currently receiving would go down 14 percent to 20 percent."
the costs for families for the same type of coverage that they currently receiving would go down percent to percent
average premiums would be percent to percent lower because of a shift in the types of people obtaining coverage
some of the shift to better coverage would be due to personal choice with subsidies many people would be able to get better coverage at the same cost or cheaper but some would be tied to new minimum coverage and the threat of tax penalties if you decide not to get insurance
but we think it bears noting that under the senate health plan about percent of people on the individual market would receive federal subsidies and those subsidies would cover nearly of the total premium
specifically the cbo estimates the average cost of family policies purchased by individuals would be in as opposed to under current law
