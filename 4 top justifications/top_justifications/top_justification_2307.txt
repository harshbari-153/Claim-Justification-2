Says at polling places in Texas on Super Tuesday "the Republican side gets 25 machines, the Democratic side gets 5 machines. People were literally standing in line for seven hours."
clinton said that voters in texas had to wait in long lines because the republican side gets machines the democratic side gets five machines
in harris county an equal number of voting machines for each party was placed at every polling place
clinton is right that some voters in texas stood in line for hours to vote on tuesday but is she right about the cause were more machines allocated to republican primary voters than to democrats in texas
clinton is right that people in texas waited for hours to vote but she s off on the polling machine disparity
in travis county which also saw long lines democrats and republicans can vote using the same machines at any polling place during the primary
