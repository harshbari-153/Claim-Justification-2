Says the NAACP's Ohio chapter has endorsed Issue 2.
in response to the caucus concerns sandy theis a spokeswoman for the group voters first ohio told gongwer that the ohio conference naacp has endorsed issue
voters first ohio claims issue is endorsed by ohio conference naacp
so where does the ohio conference naacp stand on issue the naacp has not blanketly endorsed issue sybil the organization s president said in a telephone interview on oct
if the ohio naacp officially has not endorsed issue we asked if she asked voters first to remove the group s name from the list of voters first supporters
so where does that leave us although there appears to be some support for issue from within the ohio conference naacp the bottom line is that the group as a whole has not endorsed issue
