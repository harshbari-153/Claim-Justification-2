Says Bill Gates said, "We need to develop a digital certificate that shows who has received all the vaccinations. Only those with all the required vaccinations may travel, visit churches, participate in sports and music events, get a job, etc."
this is bill gates statement from last night on cnn it says before quoting gates as saying we need to develop a digital certificate that shows who has received all the vaccinations
on july gates did appear on cnn for a town hall about the coronavirus and he did discuss vaccines though not a digital certificate
only those with all the required vaccinations may travel visit churches participate in sports and music events get a job etc
bill gates didn t say this about vaccines
later he talked about wanting to convince people at least over percent to take this vaccine
