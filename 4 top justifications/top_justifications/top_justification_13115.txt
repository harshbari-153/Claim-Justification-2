"Forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan isn't the answer, but that's exactly what the Democrats' plan would do."
forcing americans off of their current health coverage and onto a plan is the answer but that exactly what the democrats plan would do
boehner said that was exactly what the democrats plan would do
but does this really fit the criteria of forcing americans off of their current health coverage and onto a plan while private companies are contractors in the medicare advantage program so it does have more of a free market element to it at the end of the day medicare and medicare advantage are both plans where the government decides how much it will pay for a basic package of benefits
the problem with this line of reasoning is that the democratic proposals so far include rules specifically to stop this from happening
whether you call it a public option an a trigger or a the fact is all of these proposals put us on the path to health care said republican house leader john boehner
