marco rubio said a supreme court justice suggested that some cases will be decided based on south african law
might be decided based on south african law
we wondered what rubio was talking about it sounded like he was saying that a supreme court justice had suggested that future cases will be decided based on south african law
should be decided based on anything from south african law
let me just say if you are an appellate lawyer you need to brush up on your south african law because that is how some cases apparently are going to be decided here going forward
