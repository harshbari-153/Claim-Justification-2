"We just don't want to get to be like Louisiana, where you have drive-up daiquiri shops."
bill kennemer told a reporter we just do want to get to be like louisiana where you have daiquiri shops
are there daiquiri in louisiana
technically louisiana does not allow open containers in vehicles
we realize kennemer is citing an extreme example and that s fine but we should also remind readers that loosening our liquor laws won t necessarily turn us into louisiana
in an interview he explained he was driving around the new orleans area with his wife cherie one recent summer and they kept spotting these signs for daiquiris
