"The overall fact about illegal immigration is that it's not actually getting worse."
the overall fact about illegal immigration is that it not actually getting worse
we were curious to see if maddow was right in saying that illegal immigration is not getting worse
illegal immigration is not increasing and by at least two measurements illegal immigration has actually gotten somewhat better
but do herald the defeat of illegal immigration just yet
the whole story is better reflected in the total estimated population of illegal immigrants in the united states
