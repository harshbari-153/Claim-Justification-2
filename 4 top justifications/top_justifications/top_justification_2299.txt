"You go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want, and no background check."
but you go to a gun show you can buy whatever you want and no background check
biden said you go to a gun show you can buy whatever you want and no background check
most people do know it you walk into a store and you buy a gun you have a background check
if you go to a gun show and buy a firearm from a federally licensed seller you will have to pass a background check just as if you went to a gun store
you would only escape a background check at a gun show if you bought from a seller who isn t federally licensed
