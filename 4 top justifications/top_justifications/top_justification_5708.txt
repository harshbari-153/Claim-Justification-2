Says Bill de Blasio is "banning hot dog sales to stop climate change."
new york city mayor bill deblasio is now banning hot dog sales to stop climate change reads an april facebook post misspelling de blasio s name
no nyc isn t banning the sale of hot dogs to stop climate change
that s misleading but the facebook post goes a step further and says the city is banning the sale of hot dogs which isn t true
but readers can be forgiven for thinking so after some news headlines like this one nyc to ban hot dogs and processed meats to improve climate
in fact the report doesn t even mention hot dogs and the city isn t prohibiting citizens or businesses from buying processed meat
