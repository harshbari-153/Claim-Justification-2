"President Obama became the first president since Carter to leave the White House with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office."
schumer said president obama became the first president since carter to leave the white house with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office
thanks in part to this initiative president obama became the first president since jimmy carter to leave the white house with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office schumer said
the graph shows that not only was obama the first president to see a drop in the federal prison population since carter but that only four other presidents johnson kennedy truman and hoover oversaw a decline on their watch
did federal inmate population drop under obama for first time since carter
however we found that the same trends held for state and local inmate populations the number declined under obama for the first time since at least the carter years
