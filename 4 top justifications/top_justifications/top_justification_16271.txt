"You don't have to be as smart as a fifth-grader to know what causes the climate is the sun. The sun.  I have people tell me, ‘Carbon dioxide warms the Earth.’  No, it doesn't.  The sun warms the Earth."
you do have to be as smart as a to know what causes the climate is the sun zimmerman said
don zimmerman says every child learns the sun warms the earth carbon dioxide does not
so did we remember our science correctly or put another way was zimmerman correct that what causes the climate is the sun and that the sun warms the earth or was he just blowing hot air
zimmerman said that as every child learns the sun warms the he said carbon dioxide does not
we remember learning in that class that the sun is the chief source of energy in our solar system but we also remember studying how greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide helped trap warmth from the sun
