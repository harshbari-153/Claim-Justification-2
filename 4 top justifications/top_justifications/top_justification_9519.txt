Says Bernie Sanders advocated putting "Iranian troops into Syria to try and resolve the conflict there. Putting them right on the doorstep of Israel."
clinton said sanders suggested that iranian troops should fight on the ground in syria
clinton says sanders proposed iranian troops in syria
still we can take it that sanders did promote the presence of iranian troops in syria
but sanders comments were in the context of a muslim fighting force that included nations largely friendly toward israel
it s true that sanders envisioned that the iranian troops would be part of a much larger muslim coalition that included jordan and turkey
