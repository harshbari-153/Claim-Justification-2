At the State of the Union address, Democrats, "even on positive news … were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not?"
i mean yeah i guess why not can we call that treason why not
somebody said treasonous
somebody said treasonous
i mean yeah i guess why not can we call that treason why not i mean they certainly didn t seem to love our country very much
first the long to the treason comment came off as entirely serious and while the reference to treason itself was uttered in a flip manner it fell short of being clearly a joke
