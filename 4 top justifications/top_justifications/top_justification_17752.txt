"Since President Obama took full control of Washington," every day, 13,000 more people "have been put on food stamps."
the one we re looking at in this item is since president obama took full control of washington every day more people have been put on food stamps
our ruling the nrcc ad is right on the number of additional americans using food stamps during obama s time in office
clearly the rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the most recent recession which began more than a year before obama took office
assuming that three years means days or times then the number of additional food stamp recipients per day of the obama presidency was either using the january figure or using the february figure
we should also note that this ad uses the formulation since president obama took full control of washington
