Says Ann Coulter said, "I am a settler. I am descended from settlers â€” not from immigrants."
conservative commentator ann coulter popped up in facebook memeland recently with a post that quoted her as saying she wasn t a descendent of immigrants but rather of settlers
i am descended from settlers not from immigrants
i am a settler
we not judging whether it accurate for coulter to call herself a settler
while coulter s mother s side can be traced back to colonialism smolenyak wrote that coulter s paternal ancestors came to america two centuries later than the first europeans a stretch for fitting the definition of settler
