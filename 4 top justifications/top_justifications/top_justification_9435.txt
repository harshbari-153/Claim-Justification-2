About 800 people refused to get a drug screening because they are "out there on drugs."
about people refused to get a drug screening because they re on drugs said paige kreegel
kreegel said about people failed a drug screening requirement to receive welfare and about more applied for benefits but refused to be screened because they are out there on drugs
the number is low he said but there are hundreds more who are on drugs but were deterred by the drug screening
but the rest of the truth in that story is that about percent of the people who refused a drug test didn t receive welfare
in the last line they newspapers do admit that there are about and some people who refuse to take the drug test he said which tells me if you add all together there people out there on drugs
