Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis wrongly takes credit for small-business program
raptakis says mollis wrongly takes credit for program
it is clear to us that mollis did not give his predecessors appropriate credit for coming up with the ideas he is finally now making happen
raptakis said mollis ignored the program for the first three years of his term before reintroducing the proposal as his own this spring
mollis said that soon after he took office he reestablished the dormant fast start office and began lobbying for legislative support for the master application idea which ultimately was approved and funded this spring
jim langevin matt brown did mollis really ignore laws established by his predecessors and then take credit for them we could resist putting this one to the test
