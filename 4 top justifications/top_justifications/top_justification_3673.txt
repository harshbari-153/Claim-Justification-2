"We balanced the budget with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, and ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets."
responding to a comment from rick santorum about fiscal responsibility gingrich said when we balanced the budget with the balanced budget act and ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets we doubled the size of the national institutes of health because we set priorities
it a little too simple to say that the balanced budget act balanced the budget
this time he said that the nation ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets
for four years we balanced the budget and paid off billion in debt
i balanced the budget for four straight years paid off billion in debt
