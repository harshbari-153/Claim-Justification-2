The Red Sox waited "87 long years" to win the World Series.
we waited long years
and true suffering red sox fans that my family and i are we could not have been more happy than to see the red sox win the world series except by being able to beat the yankees when they were ahead three games to none
that how many years passed between the team world series victory and its next one in
but to sox fans it was a significant mistake
do a google search on the phrase years as we did and five of the first listings relate to the red sox
