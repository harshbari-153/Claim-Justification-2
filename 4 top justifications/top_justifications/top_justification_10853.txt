"While all COVID-19 news has been going on, the U.S. Government has been sneakily trying to remove end-to-end encryption" which means "the government will be able to see all of your messages and listen to all of your calls."
government has been sneakily trying to remove encryption which means the government will be able to see all of your messages and listen to all of your calls
government has been sneakily trying to remove encryption and it s been working its way through congress
if this passes the government will be able to see all of your messages and listen to all of your calls essentially removing all privacy from your conversations
is the government trying to change encryption rules
the portion of the post that says the government will be able to see all of your messages and listen to all of your calls is also an exaggeration
