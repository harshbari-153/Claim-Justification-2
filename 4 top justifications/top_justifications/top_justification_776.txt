When it comes to aid, "the United States is still about half as what European countries give as a percentage."
the united states is still about half as what european countries give as a percentage and i think he knows that not right
so when bono said the united states is still about half as what european countries give as a percentage is he talking about aids relief or foreign aid in general
in fact in the united states accounted for more than half
in other words it fair to say the united states is providing about half as much development assistance as european countries as a percentage of gni
we decided to check whether bono was right that the united states is still about half as what european countries give as a percentage
