Up "to 45 percent" of illegal immigrants "are not people that physically crossed the southern border or northern border. They are visa overstayers."
castro said up to percent of illegal immigrants are not people that physically crossed the southern border or northern border
and another thing the democratic mayor of san antonio said during the april univision program do you know that up to percent of the people who are here undocumented or illegal whatever word you want to use are not people that physically crossed the southern border or northern border they are visa overstayers they are people that came to this country and then just overstayed their visa
the group s post said that up to percent of unauthorized immigrants are overstayers
that percentage aligned with an estimate supported by a report by the pew hispanic center of the share of unauthorized residents who had overstayed visas though we came up with no research into how many overstayers came by airplane
known as overstayers these migrants became part of the unauthorized population when they remained in the country after their visas had expired it said
