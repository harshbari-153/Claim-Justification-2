The Obama administration is "proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030."
a video by credo action said the obama administration is proposing to mine another billion tons of wyoming coal which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than obama clean power plan would even save through
credo is right that mining billion tons of coal in quick order would more than negate any carbon reductions from obama s epa plan
credo s video says obama s trip is antithetical to some of his own policies including proposing to mine another billion tons of wyoming coal which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than obama clean power plan would even save through
it assumes that all billion tons of wyoming coal would be burned by which would require a staggering increase in coal use
that dwarfs what the environmental protection agency says obama clean power plan will cut in carbon emissions
