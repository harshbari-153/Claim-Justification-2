the chinese government provides their people no access to the internet rubio said on march
marco rubio says chinese government provides no access to the internet
however the government blocks many popular internet sites and censors content limiting the access for chinese people
some chinese users try to get around the firewall and access forbidden sites through virtual private networks or vpns that essentially allow users to tunnel out of the country to avoid the censors but china also cracked down on those services which its daily newspaper called illegal
