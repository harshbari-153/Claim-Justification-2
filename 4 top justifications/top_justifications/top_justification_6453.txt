"Ukraine has been shooting residents of Donetsk and Lugansk just because they wanted to speak Russian."
a recent facebook post seems to echo russian talking points claiming that for eight years ukraine has been shooting residents of donetsk and lugansk just because they wanted to speak russian
since russia s military presence started growing on ukraine s borders in december claims of genocide of russian speakers in eastern ukraine have been a constant background hum on russian state propaganda channels russian journalist and alexey kovalev told the new york times
he called russia s attack on ukraine a mission to protect people who for eight years now have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the kyiv regime
no evidence to support claims that ukraine is killing people for speaking russian
ukraine s parliament has made ukrainian the country s official language but the law doesn t prohibit the use of russian and most of the country speaks it fluently beardsley reported
