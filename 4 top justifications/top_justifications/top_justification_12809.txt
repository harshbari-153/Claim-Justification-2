Trey Gowdy said, "I’m not saying COVID-19 isn’t real…. But pay attention folks, there’s much more going on here than what meets the eye."
but pay attention folks there s much more going on here than meets the eye
trey gowdy a republican from south carolina
no trey gowdy did write this conspiracy theory
the statement credited to gowdy said the coronavirus and the chaos it has wrought on the economy seems fishy a little timed if you ask me
this post seemed a little fishy to us and perhaps it s because gowdy never said it
