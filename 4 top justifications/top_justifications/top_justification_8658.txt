"Debt doubled" under Bush "and now it’s tripling under Barack Obama’s watch."
this means that the debt just about doubled under bush
paul said debt doubled under bush and now it s tripling under barack obama s watch
a person could easily interpret it to mean that debt has tripled since obama took office which would be incorrect
paul on the other hand said that it means debt today under obama is triple what it was when bush s term started
so the debt is a little more than triple what the debt was when bush took office in
