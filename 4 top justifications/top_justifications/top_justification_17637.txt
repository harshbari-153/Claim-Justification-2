"Canadians face major donut shortage after first day of cannabis legalization."
donuts were not in short supply after canada legalized marijuana
the first day of marijuana sales did result in shortages of cannabis not donuts
we can t say the same for the canadian donut industry
canadian donut sales were unlikely hurt by the legalization of marijuana
canada became the second country in the world to legalize recreational marijuana
