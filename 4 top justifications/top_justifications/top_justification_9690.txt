Says the Portland Childrenâ€™s Levy holds its "administrative expenses to less than 5 percent."
are administrative costs capped at percent for the portland children levy
politifact oregon can t judge what is the proper amount for administrative costs but we can say that saltzman is accurate when he says the portland children s levy holds its administrative expenses to less than percent
in singing the levy s praises he said and we hold our administrative expenses to less than percent
an outfit like the portland children s levy needs little to no resources to collect revenue it comes out of property taxes while the new arts tax will require bodies to collect what is basically a head tax of per adult worker
so when supporters of a tax levy for children pitched the program in and in they made sure to tell voters that administrative costs would be capped at percent of all money received from an increase in property taxes
