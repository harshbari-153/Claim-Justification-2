"NFL fines Pittsburgh Steelers $1 million each for skipping national anthem."
org ran with the headline breaking nfl fines pittsburgh steelers each for skipping national anthem
nfl s goodell did say he would fine steelers players million each for skipping national anthem
then the post said nfl commissioner roger goodell announced shortly after the game began that every player who protested the national anthem and showed immense disrespect to our nation would be fined a cool million dollars
in this case the website attempted to trick readers into thinking the nfl was punishing the steelers for refusing to come onto the field for the banner
a fake news story that said players for pittsburgh s nfl team were being fined seven figures for remaining in the locker room during the banner is the work of a liberal troll looking to fool conservatives
