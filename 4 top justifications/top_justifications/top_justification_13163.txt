"Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because ‘Santa Was Always White In The Bible.’"
article carried the headline sarah palin calls to boycott mall of america because santa was always white in the bible
but it s still not immediately apparent that its editors fabricated the story claiming palin said she would boycott the mall of america because santa was always white in the bible
the article quoted palin as saying people should run the mall of america into the ground on the basis of santa always having been white in the bible and no i refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities i thought the company had some backbone but i guess i was wrong
but the entire rest of the article detailing palin s supposed call to boycott the mall because of the bible s teachings on santa is completely made up
fake news site says sarah palin to boycott mall of america over black santa
