Says Mark Hass "raised your taxes by $1 billion in a single day."
did mark hass raise taxes by billion in a single day
that s the case with a legislative attack we first saw in that claimed senate majority leader richard devlin had raised your taxes by billion in a single day
we noted then as we do now that while lawmakers did vote for billion in new taxes in a single day there were some important details missing the timing of the taxes who had approved them and who was being taxed
much as it had originally the mailer breaks the tax increase down to the second noting that raising taxes by billion in a single day comes down to more than million an hour or nearly a minute or each second
williams also noted that hass in particular has voted to raise taxes by nearly a billion dollars twice before and voters ultimately rejected those increases
