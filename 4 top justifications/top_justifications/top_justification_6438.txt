The Astroworld concert was a "test run on the vaxxed" because people who are injected with graphene oxide can be controlled through magnetic frequencies, including music.
a facebook post claims the astroworld concert was a test run on the vaxxed because people who are injected with graphene oxide can be controlled through magnetic frequencies including music
the post goes on to say that a material called graphene oxide can destroy consciousness and control people through magnetic frequencies which includes music
they re practicing once they put graphene oxide in you all they have to do is tune the frequency
a post linking astroworld tragedy to vaccines and graphene oxide is false
com a graphene news website said graphene oxide is not magnetic and not a conductive material so it can not be used in the ways people suggest in such videos
