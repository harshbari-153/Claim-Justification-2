Says "Schaufler was the only Democrat who voted to stop" the stateâ€™s health care reform plan.
was mike schaufler the only democrat to vote against health care reform
when a bill to implement governor kitzhaber and president obama s health care reform plan came up for a vote in oregon schaufler was the only democrat who voted to stop it
we re concerned with whether he was really the only democrat who voted to stop the health care legislation
what was the mailer s basis for tying schaufler to republicans a vote he took on health care legislation during the february session
we agree that schaufler certainly voted to stall the bill initially and he ticked off a lot of his fellow democrats in doing so
