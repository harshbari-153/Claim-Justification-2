shaheen said back when ted cruz called mitch mcconnell a liar on the floor of the senate floor nobody invoked rule to censor him
back when ted cruz called mitch mcconnell a liar on the floor of the senate floor nobody invoked rule to censor him so this has been a very subjective process shaheen said
senate republicans did not use rule when ted cruz attacked mitch mcconnell
so cruz didn t specifically use the word liar to describe mcconnell an important caveat
while other republicans did admonish cruz for doing so the rule that silenced warren was not invoked
