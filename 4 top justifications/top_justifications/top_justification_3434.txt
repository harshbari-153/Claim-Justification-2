"Most Americans on minimum wage earn less than a Dickensian allegory for destitution."
most americans on minimum wage earn less than a dickensian allegory for destitution
a facebook post based on a tweet said that a charles dickens allegory for destitution made more than most american workers today do on a minimum wage salary
he added that dickens knew what a wage would be for a worker like cratchit with his family would be as did his readers
christmas carol character s wages not the best comparison to today s minimum wage worker
in charles dickens classic a christmas carol ebenezer scrooge s poor clerk bob cratchit certainly didn t have the best working conditions
