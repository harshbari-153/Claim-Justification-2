"Since Obama took office, a net of 540,000 additional black Americans – Obama’s strongest supporters – have lost their jobs."
since obama took office a net of additional black americans obama s strongest supporters have lost their jobs the tea party retweeted to its followers on sept
our ruling the tea party blames obama for an additional half million blacks being unemployed since he took office
he said obama is squarely to blame for the employment decrease among blacks because of programs such as obamacare and unwillingness by corporations to spend money in a economy
the group s number of unemployed is correct and the naacp concurs that blacks are among obama s biggest supporters
percent unemployment rate among blacks is way too high and that other problems that plagued black communities before he took office such as housing and education have worsened
