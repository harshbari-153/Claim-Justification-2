Roy Blunt "voted to raise his own pay 12 times" while in Congress.
kander said blunt voted to raise his own pay times while in congress
each of the times blunt is alleged to have increased his pay came between and when blunt was still a member of the house of representatives for missouri s district
blunt did not literally vote to increase his pay times
as a result congressional salaries including blunt s did not increase
while blunt actually voted in favor of this bill when it was passed in the house kander points to blunt s vote against the conference bill which resolved the differences between the house s and senate s versions of the bill as a vote to increase his own pay
