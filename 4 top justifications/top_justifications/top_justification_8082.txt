Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid "said, quote, 'I can't stand John McCain.' "
he said quote i ca stand john mccain
the personal criticism is a bit puzzling if only because mccain and reid have had few public
reid assessment of mccain bipartisanship in the video is harsh even by most democratic critics standards
mccain has been out campaigning and absent from the senate chamber for most of the time reid has served as majority leader
reid went on to dismiss mccain record of bipartisanship as something of a myth
