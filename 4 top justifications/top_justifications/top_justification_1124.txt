An Illinois couple who received five vote-by-mail applications can vote five times.
a facebook post says an illinois couple received five applications and will be able use them to receive multiple ballots and cast multiple votes
the post claims that the illinois couple who received them could easily use the applications to get multiple ballots and cast multiple votes
a common misconception going around social media is that people who receive multiple mail ballot applications can in turn vote multiple times and no one would know
the post reads a husband and wife received vote by mail ballots request
no receiving multiple ballot applications doesn t let you vote more than once
