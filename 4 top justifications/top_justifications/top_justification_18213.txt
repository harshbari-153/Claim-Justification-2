"The weight of the evidence (on global warming) is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... itâ€™s fair to say the science is in dispute."
the weight of the evidence is that most of it maybe all of it is because of natural causes
the science about the causes of global climate change is in dispute
but at least as to any potential contribution to it it s fair to say the science is in dispute
do scientists disagree about global warming
rather there is significant scientific consensus that human beings are contributing to global warming
