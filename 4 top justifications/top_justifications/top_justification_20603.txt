Nostradamus predicted that a "feeble man" would rule the "Western World" after a time of "plague."
nostradamus didn t predict a man would rule the world
after a feeble man shall rule the western world with a jezebel
a plague shall fall upon the world
according to lexico and the oxford english dictionary poet and lawyer william warner coined the phrase in two decades after nostradamus died
david bell a professor of history at princeton told us that the verses were fabricated and that they contain an anachronism the phrase western world was not in use while nostradamus was alive
