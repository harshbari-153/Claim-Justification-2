mcauliffe says a judge removed ken cuccinelli from the star scientific tax case
we asked josh schwerin mcauliffe s campaign spokesman for proof that a judge removed cuccinelli from the case
technically mcauliffe has a point in that a judge did take the case away from cuccinelli
cuccinelli also disclosed belatedly his sale of star scientific stock because he said he hadn t realized its value had crossed the threshold above which the state requires disclosure
