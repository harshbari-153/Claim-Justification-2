House Bill 2301 never had a public hearing
hb never had a public hearing
elements of the final bill were discussed in passing but the heart of it did not receive a public hearing
so what gives who s right did house bill get a public hearing well yes and no
the claim that the legislation received no public hearing is mostly true accurate but needing additional clarification
but we don t agree with wingard that public hearings on the original bill mean hearings on the version that passed
