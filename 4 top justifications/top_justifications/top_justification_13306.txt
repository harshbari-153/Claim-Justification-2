"At John Lewis funeral Obama told a room full of people that rooms full of people is too dangerous so we must mail in vote."
a facebook post published later that day summed up his speech this way at john lewis funeral obama told a room full of people that rooms full of people is too dangerous so we must mail in vote
a few days before lewis died obama tweeted that voting by mail shouldn t be a partisan issue especially during a pandemic
he also spoke at some length about voter suppression and in his words the most powerful tool we have which is the right to vote
but even as we sit here there are those in power who are doing their darndest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive id laws and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision even undermining the postal service in the to an election that is going to be dependent on ballots so people don t get sick
he said everybody should be able to request an absentee ballot and make their voice heard in every election
