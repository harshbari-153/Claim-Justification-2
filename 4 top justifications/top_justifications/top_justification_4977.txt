A year since the "Recovery Summer," there has been been "a fall, winter and spring of no recovery."
and you re right it has been a fall winter and spring of no recovery
in fact it wasn t a fall winter or spring of recovery
portman on the other hand said that it wasn t the summer of recovery nor was it a fall winter or spring of recovery
yet portman spoke specifically of a summer fall winter and spring of no recovery
it s been a year since we announced the summer of recovery u
