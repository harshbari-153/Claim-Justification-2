"Doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries."
by the way did you know that doctors kill about people a year in botched surgeries
clarke said doctors kill about people a year in botched surgeries
but a claim clarke made about doctors killing people is what caught our attention
do americans die every year because of mistakes made during surgery
that would be akin to me trying to transform the medical community after a botched surgery when i know nothing about the medical community
