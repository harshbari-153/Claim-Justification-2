"Every county, including Chittenden, has fewer people available for work."
every county including chittenden has fewer people available for work he said
the governor may have been relying on old information when he said chittenden county has fewer people available for work today than in the past
to put this in perspective every county except chittenden has seen a decline in the number of people working
the governor s remark seemed to challenge conventional wisdom that chittenden county home to vermont s largest city and percent of the state s total population is somewhat immune to the demographic struggles facing the rest of the state
but is the governor right we decided to break down the data ourselves to find out just how hard chittenden county has been hit by the demographic downturn being felt elsewhere essex county for example has seen a percent decline in its labor force
