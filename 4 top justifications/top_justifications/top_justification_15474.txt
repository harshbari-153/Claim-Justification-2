"My grandparents were proud immigrants to the United States of America, here to Illinois in the late 1800s. My grandparents did not speak English when they were young."
my grandparents were proud immigrants to the united states of america here to illinois in the late rauner said
my grandparents were immigrants
he expanded on his grandparents narrative adding that they came to this country in the late and did not speak english when they were young
topping all that is the acknowledgement by rauner himself in his tribune interview that his grandparents were not immigrants
rauner s assertion in august that his grandparents immigrated to illinois is yet another inaccuracy
