"Hillary (Clinton) caught on tape laughing about (Hurricane) Irma ‘wiping out all of those Florida hillbillies’."
website read hillary caught on tape laughing about irma wiping out all of those florida hillbillies
hillary clinton wanted irma to every florida hillbilly off the map fake post says
a bogus news story claimed that former democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton told rachel maddow it would be better if hurricane irma destroyed florida but the post really came from a website that is part of a network of internet trolls
the post which we found on several other websites said that clinton was shooting an undated interview for the rachel maddow show on msnbc when she slammed the sunshine state and its residents
clinton did not deride florida on tape or suggest its residents should be blown away by a hurricane
