Obama creates new tax on Christmas trees, fees get passed on to consumers.
locally we spotted a multnomah county gop retweet of the republican national committee obama admin creates new tax on christmas tree farms fees get passed onto the consumer
republicans bloggers needle obama for creating new tax on christmas trees true
was the president seriously imposing a new tax that might make our holidays a little less as it happens a national fresh tree group had sought the tree assessment to better promote its products
as for the claim that obama created this new tax that suggests that he came up with the program when it s clear the idea preceded his presidency and originated with the industry
it s at the sole discretion of the obama administration to impose a tax and they decided to impose this tree tax
