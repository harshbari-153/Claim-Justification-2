"Our minority graduation rate went from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%" when I was Beloit school superintendent.
holtz says that when he ran the beloit school district our minority graduation rate went from levels below milwaukee and madison to above
specifically he claimed our minority graduation rate went from levels below milwaukee and madison to above
what about the contention that beloit s graduation rates started out below those of minority students in milwaukee and madison
at that time beloit s rate for black students was slightly lower than in milwaukee but slightly above madison s rate
the statement caught our attention in part because milwaukee and madison have struggles with low graduation rates for black and hispanic students
