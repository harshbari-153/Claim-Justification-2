Says Thom Tillis voted to support Trumpâ€™s emergency declaration to fund the border wall even though it would "raid $80 million from North Carolina."
the dscc s tweet said thom tillis yet again voted to support trump s irresponsible emergency declaration even though he knows it will allow the administration to raid million from north carolina
the dscc said tillis supported trump s emergency declaration which enabled the administration to raid million from north carolina military projects
did thom tillis vote to let trump administration raid million from nc military projects
but in the meantime tillis is supporting trump s decision to divert funding from military bases around the world
we wondered if it s true that tillis supported the emergency declaration and whether north carolina actually stands to lose million
