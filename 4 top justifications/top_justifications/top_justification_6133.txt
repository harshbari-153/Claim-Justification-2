Says Suzanne Bonamici "supports the $500 billion cut to Medicare passed last year."
and yet there it was during a speech he delivered wednesday senator bonamici says she supports the billion cut to medicare passed last year
for that reason we re giving cornilles a false for his statement that bonamici supports billion in cuts to medicare
first up we called bonamici s campaign to make sure she even supports the affordable care act
suzanne bonamici his democratic opponent of supporting a billion cut
case in point the republican bit that some democrat or another voted to cut a whopping billion from medicare by supporting president obama s affordable care act
