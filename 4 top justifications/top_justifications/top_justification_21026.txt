"There have been literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986, last time we did this."
there have been literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since last time we did this
so portman after all of this appears to be correct there have been literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since last time we did this
we are still without a precise count of the number of loopholes and preferences added after the tax reform
like portman this committee cited as a baseline because that was the last time congress overhauled the nation s tax code
among the committee s observations the tax code has become more complex and more unstable over the last two decades in part because legislators have increasingly used targeted tax provisions to achieve social policy objectives normally achieved by spending programs
