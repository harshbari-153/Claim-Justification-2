Because of Gov. Scott Walkerâ€™s budgeting, a greater percentage of general fund tax dollars is "going to pay off debt than ever before in our history."
vinehout said that because of walker s budgeting a greater percentage of general tax dollars is going to pay off debt than ever before in our history
walker s budget she added pays that price in a greater percent of tax dollars going to pay off debt than ever before in our history
is vinehout right that because walker pushed principal payments on the state s debt into future years a higher percentage of general tax dollars is going to debt payments than ever before
she says the percentage of general tax dollars as opposed to gas tax money for example that are being used toward debt payments is the highest ever and that walker s debt restructuring is largely responsible for it
but she suggested walker restructuring is what led to the record rate of general fund spending on debt payments
