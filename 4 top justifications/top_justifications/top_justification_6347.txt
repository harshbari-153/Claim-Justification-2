under obamacare you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it
would consumers really be forced to buy unnecessary coverage like pediatric maternity and newborn care for people with no children we asked taylor office for support
it is true that this pediatric maternity and newborn care is covered as part of the essential benefits package a spokesman told us
but the spokesman added more current insurance plans may include coverage you will never use or need such as maternity care for a man or prostate cancer coverage for women
insurance by definition includes things you do think you need
