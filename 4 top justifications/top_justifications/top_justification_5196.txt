In June 2012 "we actually had more people go on Social Security Disability [85,000] ... than the 80,000 jobs that were created."
said west so we actually had more people go on social security disability which is different from social security than the jobs that were created
allen west said that the number of people who became recipients of social security disability in june was higher than the number of jobs created that month
west says more people went on social security disability insurance in june than jobs created
it s unconscionable to think that in the month of june the federal government reported new jobs created but the little fact that no one is talking about is that we have people go on social security disability the same month
goss chief actuary of the social security administration has said that in every recession since the the number of people applying for social security disability has increased as their unemployment benefits expire
