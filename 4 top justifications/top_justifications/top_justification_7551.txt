"The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles (long)."
trump said that the great wall of china was built years ago and is miles long
in china state administration of cultural heritage released a study that the wall is miles long much longer than the previous estimate of miles which was limited to the structures
is donald trump right that the great wall of china is years old and miles long
the wall was built years ago
a number of people asked us to check whether trump s description of the great wall that it was built years ago and that it s miles long was accurate
