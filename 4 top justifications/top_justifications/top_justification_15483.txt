"I supported the surge when you didn't."
telling romney i supported the surge when you did
announcement that he supported the surge
i was a latecomer like mitt romney was to believing that the surge was effective
arguing governor huckabee said have to continue the surge while governor romney was only willing to commit that the surge was working saying his course of action depended on the surge was working
in the interview huckabee said i not sure that i support the troop surge if that surge has to come from our guard and reserve troops which have really been overly stretched
