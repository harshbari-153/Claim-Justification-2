The federal government only ordered BP to pay "to do one of those six segments" of sand barriers for Louisiana.
but here where our concern was the federal government only ordered bp to pay for to do one of those six segments
we wanted to check jindal claim that the federal government only ordered bp to pay to do one of those six segments
that one barrier would cost million and be paid for by bp or the federal oil spill liability trust fund
coast guard admiral thad allen said the government would give permission for the construction of six barriers and authorize bp to pay for one as a test to see if the barrier plan is feasible
it turns out that jindal is right about bp paying for one of six segments of sand barriers but there more to the story
