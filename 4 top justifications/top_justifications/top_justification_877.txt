"In two terms in the Missouri General Assembly, Jason Kander passed ZERO bills that were signed into law."
while kander seven bills that became law no bill he directly sponsored was signed by the governor
in a recent mailer sent to missouri voters one nation a conservative political action committee criticized democrat jason kander for not passing any legislation during his two terms as a representative in the missouri general assembly
the front of the mailer is blank except for the words this page is dedicated to all the laws jason kander passed in the missouri general assembly
kander seven bills that were eventually signed by the governor
being a democrat in a general assembly didn t make passing bills any easier for kander
