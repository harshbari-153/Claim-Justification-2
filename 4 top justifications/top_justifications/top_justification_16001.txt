Says CNN called Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi an "unarmed father of three."
cnn never aired a chyron calling baghdadi an unarmed father of three
cnn did not call abu bakr an unarmed father of three
the photo of baghdadi is real it was taken from a video posted by the islamic state s propaganda arm in april
it could have aired on cnn during baghdadi coverage albeit not with this chyron
trump kills unarmed father of three reads the chyron
