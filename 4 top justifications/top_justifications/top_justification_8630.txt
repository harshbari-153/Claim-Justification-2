American colleges amount to a "cartel."
is paul ryan right that american colleges amount to a cartel
college cartel makes for great alliteration
i m not sure how they constitute a cartel said barmak nassirian director of federal relations and policy analysis for the american association of colleges and state universities
a national review article headlined the college cartel argued the college accreditation process gives accredited schools a monopoly on higher education and weakens incentives for them to control tuition costs
today those who want to reform higher education voice the same concerns and the phrase college cartel is a soundbite
