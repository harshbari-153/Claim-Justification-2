"Rick Perry had planned to retire from the legislature until his best friend, David Weeks, and I talked him into switching parties and running for the GOP nomination for agriculture commissioner."
rove writes rick perry had planned to retire from the legislature until his best friend david weeks and i talked him into switching parties and running for the gop nomination for agriculture commissioner
karl rove says he and consultant david weeks persuaded rick perry to switch parties and run for state agriculture commissioner
weeks said rove was part of a group of republicans who encouraged perry to switch parties and make the statewide run
perry didn t comment but weeks a perry friend who s been a consultant in perry s statewide campaigns said perry was seriously considering retirement perhaps to become a lobbyist partly because his wife anita was saddled with raising their young children at the time
we wondered if perry s party shift and his challenge to agriculture commissioner jim hightower played out so simply
