amid tense federal budget negotiations among democrats social media posts made a false claim that president joe biden cut funding for historically black colleges and universities by billion
biden breaks promise cuts to black colleges universities read the headline on a video that is shared to an instagram post
biden proposed a
that the latest iteration of the reconciliation bill includes only billion that can go toward educational programs and infrastructure for black colleges and even that amount would be reduced to competitive grant funding rather than direct allocations
it s not clear how the claim arrives at billion but the suggestion that the hbcus are receiving funding cuts is wrong
