Says Time magazine cover features President Donald Trump with the text "Worst. President. Ever."
no time magazine cover does not call trump worst president ever
there is no time magazine cover featuring president donald trump with the text worst
the worst president cover has a fabricated twin with a counter message about trump best
since launching his presidential campaign donald trump has appeared on more than a dozen time magazine covers time s post said
time has featured trump on its covers in unflattering ways
