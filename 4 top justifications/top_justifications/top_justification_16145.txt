Says Sinclair Lewis said, "When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross."
sinclair lewis might have liked that quote about fascism and the flag but it was his
when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross reads the text in a screenshot of a tweet that also shows a picture of trump hugging the flag
whether lewis said the quote about fascism is the society s most asked question according to its website
in it can t happen here he writes but he saw too that in america the struggle was befogged by the fact that the worst fascists were they who disowned the word fascism and preached enslavement to capitalism under the style of constitutional and traditional native american liberty
in gideon planish he writes i just wish people wouldn t quote lincoln or the bible or hang out the flag or the cross to cover up something that belongs more to the and the three golden balls
