"Every state that has put in a graduated income tax, the middle class always pays more."
rauner said that in every state that has put in a graduated income tax the middle class always pays more
the truth is every state that has put in a graduated income tax the middle class always pays more rauner said echoing what s become a frequent talking point
but rauner s recent claim paints the issue with an even broader brush flatly declaring it the truth that all states that tax income at graduated rates penalize the middle class
and because graduated systems impose tax rates in escalating steps on different portions of income people in those states aren t paying top rates on every dollar they earn
what s more tax rates tell only part of the story
