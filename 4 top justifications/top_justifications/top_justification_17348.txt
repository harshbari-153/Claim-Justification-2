Chicago Public Schools "lead the country in high school graduation of an urban school system," "match the United States of America in kids graduating high school going on to a four-year college," and are "producing eighth-grade leaders in the country in math gains, fourth-grade leaders in reading gains."
they lead the country in high school graduation of an urban school now match the united states of america in kids graduating high school going on to a college
one of the claims was that they now match the nation in kids graduating high school and going on to a college
well let me tell you what the chicago public schools crumbling prisons with wardens as principals and guards as teachers have done
emanuel s other claim that cps leads the nation among urban districts for high school graduation was more difficult to verify
not only are more students graduating but they are leaving high school with higher achievement than graduates in prior years
