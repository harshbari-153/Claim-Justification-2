Repeal of Obamacare would "take away health care for 10.3 million Americans" who have received coverage since Oct. 1, 2013.
would as schultz said repeal of the affordable care act take away the health coverage gained by
ed schultz million people would lose insurance with obamacare repeal
there are scenarios in each category whereby people gaining insurance could see their health care taken away if obamacare is repealed and there are scenarios where their health care would remain
million people owe their coverage to obamacare
in that sense it s hard to say their insurance would be taken away if the health care law were repealed
