a facebook meme says rubio said that felons should not have their voting rights restored but that convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time
did marco rubio say felons should be barred from voting but should get their guns back

believes convicted felons should regain their right to own a gun but not the right to vote
the second quote from may says of course convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time
