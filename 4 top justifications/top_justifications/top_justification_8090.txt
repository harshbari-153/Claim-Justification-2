Says Ronald Reagan "repeatedly talked about how irresponsible it would be to allow the full faith and credit of the United States to be impaired in any kind of way."
obama said that reagan repeatedly talked about how irresponsible it would be to allow the full faith and credit of the united states to be impaired in any kind of way
the irony is you know ronald reagan i think when he was president repeatedly talked about how irresponsible it would be to allow the full faith and credit of the united states to be impaired in any kind of way
intrigued by the audio files going around the internet we decided to obama statement that reagan repeatedly talked about avoiding debt limit showdowns
reagan made the comments quoted above in a radio address to the nation on sept
looking for more examples of reagan repeatedly warning about the debt ceiling we also ran across a letter reagan wrote in to majority leader howard baker
