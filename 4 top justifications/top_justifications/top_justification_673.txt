Says Tammy Baldwinâ€™s "Medicare for All" plan means senior citizens would "no longer have" Medicare.
so what vukmir is claiming is that the medicare for all plan supported by baldwin means senior citizens would no longer have medicare
vukmir says baldwin s medicare for all means senior citizens would no longer have medicare
really mean no more medicare for senior citizens
but it s not as though senior citizens would lose medicare and be left with nothing
going backwards is telling seniors that you no longer have your medicare and your medicare advantage
