Most of the people who have signed up through the Obamacare exchanges "already had insurance."
lowry said reports show that most of the people signing up through the obamacare exchanges already had insurance
are most obamacare people who had insurance before
we are checking whether surveys show that most of the people signing up through the obamacare exchanges now called marketplaces already had insurance
if you believe the surveys of people who have signed up through these exchanges most of them already had insurance which suggests what you have basically done is a churn where you ve knocked people off their old insurance and then gotten them on the exchanges
if obamacare was about anything it was about getting more people insured
