Florida’s proposed Health Care Freedom Act "will allow Floridians to opt out of Obama’s govt. takeover of healthcare!"
but we did wonder if percent of florida voters support haridopolos amendment when it appears on the ballot in november and the health care freedom act becomes part of florida s constitution what effect will it have on implementation of the federal patient protection and affordable care act in the state would it really allow floridians to opt out of it to answer the question we went to the american legislative exchange council which publishes a legislators guide to repealing obamacare
floridians could only opt out of the affordable care act s individual mandate if the u
the opt out in that case would come as the result of a legal challenge by states that would argue their constitutions prohibit the implementation of the federal health care law
haridopolos amendment to the florida constitution would prohibit laws that compel people to have health care coverage
mike haridopolos says florida law could allow state to out of federal health care plan
