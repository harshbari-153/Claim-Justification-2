Says Nick Kahl made it harder for many families to cover basic health care expenses.
there s a grain of truth in the republicans claim that their opponents are making it harder for many families to cover basic health care expenses but it s missing so much context that we rate this claim barely true
the mailers go on to say that depending on the district either nick kahl or suzanne van orman supported a new tax on health care making it harder for many families to cover basic heath care expenses
in a recent mailer republican candidate matt wand in oregon s district tells voters that his democratic opponent was making it harder for children to get insured
as johnson sees it that means less money in oregonians pockets and therefore less for paying medical bills
but this percent tax and its impact on families is begging for some context
