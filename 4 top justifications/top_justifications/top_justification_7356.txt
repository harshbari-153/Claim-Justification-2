"The clear majority of Republican voters think that any deficit reduction package should have a balanced approach and should include some revenues."
the clear majority of republican voters think that any deficit reduction package should have a balanced approach and should include some revenues
barack obama said a clear majority of republican voters think tax revenues should be included as part of a budget deal
the poll that most supported obama statement was a gallup poll conducted july which posed the question this way as you may know congress can reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting spending raising taxes or a combination of the two
ideally how would you prefer to see congress attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit only with spending cuts mostly with spending cuts equally with spending cuts and tax increases mostly with tax increases or only with tax increases the answer only spending cuts got percent from republicans
because it turns out poll after poll many done by your organizations show that it s not just democrats who think we need to take a balanced approach it s republicans as well
