Tom Barrett "voted for the largest tax increase in history ... raising taxes on gas and Social Security."
republican governors association says tom barrett voted for the largest tax increase in history
more taxes or less jobs barrett has raised taxes every year he s been mayor and before that he voted for the largest tax increase in history
but the evidence is clear while barrett voted for a big tax bill it s not the largest in american history based on its actual share of economic output which economists and the treasury department say is the most valid approach
but was it really the largest tax increase in history we started with the republican governors association which produced the ad
he told politifact wisconsin according to the new york times the measure was the largest tax increase in american history
