When he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama "had the biggest Democratic majorities in Congress since Lyndon Johnson."
o malley barbour said has amnesia about the fact that obama had the biggest democratic majorities in congress since lyndon johnson
haley barbour says barack obama benefited from biggest congressional democratic majorities since lyndon johnson
we thought we d check whether barbour was right that obama had larger democratic majorities than at any point since the johnson presidency which took place from november to january
and for three of those congresses there was also a democratic president in office first jimmy carter then bill clinton
it s true that democratic strength in congress at the beginning of obama s term was the strongest it had been in years
