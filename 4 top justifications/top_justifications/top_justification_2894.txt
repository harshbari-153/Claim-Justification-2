"When Pepperâ€™s tax was finally voted down, Pepper laid off cops and closed jails and let criminals run free in the streets."
when pepper tax was finally voted down pepper laid off cops and closed jails and let criminals run free in the streets the video s narrator said
so there s no doubt the county budget pepper approved resulted in laid off cops the shuttering of a prison and more criminals on the street
he would not blame pepper because he tried to pay for a new jail and keep police on the street by temporarily raising the sales tax
and it says pepper closed multiple jails when only one was closed as a result of the budget
the fact remains however that pepper voted in favor of a county budget he knew would reduce the sheriff s staff and shutter an jail at a time when prisoner overcrowding already was a longtime problem
