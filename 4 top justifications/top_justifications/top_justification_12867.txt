Says Donna Campbell is pushing a 35 percent sales tax extending to medicine, groceries and real estate.
our ruling wentworth says campbell is pushing a percent sales tax extending to medicine groceries and real estate
jeff wentworth says donna campbell pushing percent expanded sales tax
by email campbell spokesman jon oliver said that campbell replied on the questionnaire that she supports moving texas away from property taxes to the existing sales tax and also agreed that texas should phase out property taxes in favor of consumption taxes
he said that based on heflin s testimony wentworth concluded that campbell favors a state sales tax rate of percent
all told too it s ridiculous to assert that campbell who has signed pledges is pushing or calling for an expanded sales tax set at percent
