Says "Gov. Parsonâ€™s administration purged 100,000 kids from Medicaid rolls."
on facebook and in campaign ads galloway said that governor parson s administration purged kids from medicaid rolls
facebook post galloway reinforced her argument by saying the parson administration purged kids from medicaid
parson administration did remove almost kids from medicaid as galloway said
that s still about children short of galloway s claim but her argument that parson s administration removed a huge number of children from medicaid is still accurate
the missouri department of social services s data shows that children were dropped from medicaid under parson s administration from june to december
