"President Obama pledged to go through the budget 'line by line,' but on his watch, non-defense spending has spiraled out of control, increasing by 67 percent in the last year alone."
president obama pledged to go through the budget by line boehner wrote but on his watch nondefense spending has spiraled out of control increasing by percent in the last year alone
but because boehner wrote that nondefense spending has spiraled out of control to use numbers that refer to budget authority are at best misleading
one of the most reliable republican attacks on president barack obama has been that he and his allies in congress are spending too much of the taxpayers money
so if you remove from the calculations the unspent budget authority from the stimulus sticking instead to the nondefense discretionary outlays in both the regular budget and the stimulus the increase from to was
the budget authority for nondefense discretionary spending in including budget authority from the stimulus bill was billion
