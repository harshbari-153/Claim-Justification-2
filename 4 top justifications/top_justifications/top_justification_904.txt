"Supreme Court Shakes Up 2020 Election, Assigns Conservatives To Swing State Circuit Courts."
supreme court shakes up election assigns conservatives to swing state circuit courts reads the headline of an article published in the gop daily brief
an article claims that the supreme court is shaking up the election by assigning conservatives to circuit courts
if the circuit justice thought there was a potentially substantial claim he or she would refer the request to the full supreme court
the reassignment of conservative supreme court justices won t have an impact on the outcome of election challenges because the bulk of litigation takes place in state courts said rebecca green a law professor and of the election law program at william mary law school
and even if a circuit justice did act unilaterally the full court could overrule that ruling
