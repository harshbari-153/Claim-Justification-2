Says presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama each tried to get immigration bills passed, but "it did not work because the other party was unwilling to provide the president and his party a victory."
schultz said bush and obama each tried to get immigration bills passed but it did not work because the other party was unwilling to provide the president and his party a victory
president bush and president obama both while they were president submitted to congress an immigration bill
in fact bush and democrats were for the most part allies in trying to pass the immigration bill while many republicans were opposed
republicans did effectively derail obama s immigration efforts but in both and it was democrats who were much more likely to side with bush and republicans his own party that opposed him
so why didn t it work it did not work because the other party was unwilling to provide the president and his party a victory
