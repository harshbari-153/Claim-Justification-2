Gun manufacturers are "the only industry in the country" that have immunity from lawsuits.
biden said that gun manufacturers represent the only industry in america that is exempt from being sued
but this is different from saying the gun industry is immune to all lawsuits
the gun industry is not entirely exempt from being sued and is susceptible to some lawsuits
they re the only industry in the country that has this kind of immunity
the gun industry is susceptible to some lawsuits and there are federal laws restricting liability for a number of other types of businesses
