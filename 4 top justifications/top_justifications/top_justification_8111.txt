loopholes in current law prevent unaccompanied alien children uacs that arrive in the country illegally from being removed said trump s outline
trump said loopholes in current law prevent unaccompanied alien children uacs that arrive in the country illegally from being removed
but the law explicitly requires that a federal agency place children from countries in the least restrictive setting in many cases with family members and to help them access legal counsel for their removal proceedings
but unaccompanied minors from other countries are not immediately sent back by immigration officers they are placed in formal removal proceedings
the trump administration argues there is a loophole for unaccompanied minors primarily from central america
