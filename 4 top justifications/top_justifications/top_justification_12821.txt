Says  Sherrod Brown’s campaign attacked Josh Mandel’s military service
josh mandel claims sherrod brown campaign attacked his military service
the claim we are examining today is that brown s campaign attacked the service of mandel a republican who is currently ohio s treasurer and a marine corps reservist who served two tours in iraq
knowing those critical facts would give a different impression of the claim that brown s campaign attacked mandel s military service
travis considine mandel s communications director told politifact ohio that brown s campaign is essentially attacking josh s military service by suggesting that because his time in the marine corps was spent at the tactical level he is not as prepared to fight for ohio s veterans as sherrod brown who they call the experienced veteran in the wars on capitol hill
that leads to another that brown the democratic senator from ohio has stooped so outrageously desperately low that he attacked the military service of his opponent marine corps and iraq war veteran josh mandel
