ten days ago cicilline said hillary clinton has also said unequivocally that she did receive classified documents
we wondered if clinton has actually been unequivocal in her comments about not receiving classified documents on her personal server so we gathered together some video clips
we also asked cicilline s spokesman richard luchette to provide his evidence that clinton has said unequivocally that she didn t receive classified documents
in footage that cnn posted online on july clinton said first let me say that i am confident that i never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received
in march clinton was saying there was no classified material regardless of how it was marked
