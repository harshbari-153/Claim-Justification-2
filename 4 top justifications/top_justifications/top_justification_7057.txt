Says a new report proves the stimulus supported by N.J. Democrats cost $278,000 per job.
republicans made a similar assertion in november using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than per job
nrcc says stimulus supported by new jersey democrats cost per job
this time the claim was president obama s own top economists estimate that the stimulus debacle cost taxpayers an average per job
yet his original item did say taxpayers would have come out billion ahead if the government had simply cut a check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the stimulus so where does that leave boehner s tweet and the identical claim from the nrcc that a report said the stimulus had cost per job
back then they divided billion in stimulus spending by jobs that the white house estimated the measure had created or preserved
