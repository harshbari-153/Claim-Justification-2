"If you're a Mexican, you get sent back. ... But if you're from a noncontiguous country like the Central American countries" then you can stay in the United States.
cuellar answered if you a mexican you get sent back
long story short they get to stay in the united states
mother kids adults you sent back but if you from a noncontiguous country like the central american countries then the law says that you are going to be held and health and human services they going to place you
cuellar said that unaccompanied alien children from contiguous countries are sent back no matter what but the law calls for the placement of minors from a noncontiguous country like the central american countries in a residential setting
as a result certain parts of the legislation allow unaccompanied minors from noncontiguous countries to stay in the united states
