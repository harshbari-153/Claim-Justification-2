With recent growth "it is very clear that private-sector jobs have been doing fine."
harry reid says it clear that private sector jobs have been doing fine
it is very clear that jobs have been doing fine
we wondered whether reid is right that it is very clear that jobs have been doing fine
so reid is correct that the job growth in the has been much healthier than it s been for government jobs
still at politifact we often say that words matter and the notion that jobs have been doing fine is not at all very clear to use reid s characterization
