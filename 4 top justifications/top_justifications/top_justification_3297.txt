Says he did not support the October 2008 legislation to rescue Wall Street firms.
statement could be taken as a timely signal he didn t want congress to rescue wall street the way it did
nobody supports bailing somebody out on the backs of working people for someone to profit on wall street
rick perry denied that he ever supported the legislation approved by congress to rescue wall street
in a free market economy perry said government should not be in the business of using taxpayer dollars to bail out corporate america
but he too sounded a contradictory note i do not support a bailout
