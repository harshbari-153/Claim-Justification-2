Says the U.S. Constitution "doesn’t say anything about (redistricting) being fair. … it’s set up to be partisan."
constitution doesn t say anything about being fair and is tillman right that the redistricting system is set up to be partisan
tillman said the constitution doesn t say anything about being fair and later added it s set up to be partisan
constitution say anything about the redistricting process being fair
nc republican says redistricting is a partisan process not a fair one
some may read that as the natural consequence of giving it to the states but it s certainly not an express grant in the constitution to be partisan
