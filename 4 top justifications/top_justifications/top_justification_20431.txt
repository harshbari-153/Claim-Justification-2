Russia "has an economy the size of Italy."
graham said russia has an economy the size of italy
graham russia an economy the size of italy
though russia may have an economy the size of italy s that hardly means it too small to throw its weight around
graham compared russia s economy to italy s to show how small it is but italy s economy isn t that small compared to the rest of the world so neither is russia s
also italy has more wealth relative to the size of its population than russia does
