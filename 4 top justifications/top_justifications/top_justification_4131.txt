"I never once asked that (Megyn Kelly) be removed" as a debate moderator.
trump said i never once asked that megyn kelly be removed as a debate moderator
i don t care about megyn when megyn kelly didn t ask me a question she made a statement last time i thought it was inappropriate he said
he went so far as to say kelly should not be allowed to moderate that she should recuse herself and she shouldn t be in the debate
his assertion that he never once asked for kelly s removal piqued our interest
megyn kelly shouldn t be in the debate
