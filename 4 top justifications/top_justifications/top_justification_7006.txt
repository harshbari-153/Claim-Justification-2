Says Samuel L. Jackson said, "Maybe if we underpaid these modern mumble rappers and overpaid teachers there would be smarter people in the future and less s-----Â music."
maybe if we underpaid these modern mumble rappers and overpaid teachers there would be smarter people in the future and less s music reads what looks like a screenshot of a tweet posted to facebook on march
she could have just as easily tweeted rt realdonaldtrump maybe if we underpaid these modern mumble rappers and overpaid teachers there would be smarter people in the future and less s music
no samuel jackson did say this about pay of teachers and rappers
searching online for the quote and jackson turned up plenty of posts but none credible enough for us to endorse this facebook claim
by contrast in jackson came under fire for a legitimate tweet he made that some criticized as homophobic
