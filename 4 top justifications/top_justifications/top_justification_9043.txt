Says "only 18 percent of Portland elementary schools have art instruction compared to 83 percent nationally."
do only percent of portland elementary schools offer art compared to percent nationally
clarification only of portland elementary schools have art instruction compared to nationally
we re not sure they can be perfectly compared but even if you do your best to chip away at the national number you re still left with a dramatic gulf in which percent of elementary schools nationally say they offer art education with a certified art teacher while only percent of schools can likely say the same
the difference is important because a school could offer art instruction in a classroom as many portland schools do without explicitly employing an art teacher
that study looked at the percent of public elementary schools that have instruction designed for various arts subjects
