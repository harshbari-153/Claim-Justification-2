The 30 percent tax rate called for under President Barack Obamaâ€™s proposed Buffett Rule "is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already -- not just for millionaires, for people making over $200,000."
when biden says the rate required by the buffett rule is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already he s comparing the percentage of income paid as taxes the buffett rule to a marginal tax rate the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already
the white house website defines the buffett rule without citing a specific tax rate no household making more than million each year should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle class family pays the web page says
and he is proposing that the buffett rule should replace the alternative minimum tax which now burdens americans rather than stopping the richest americans from paying too little as was originally intended
so is it true as biden said that the percent tax rate is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already not just for millionaires for people making over
the first thing we noticed about biden s speech is its definition of the buffett rule which stems from billionaire investor warren buffett s observation that his secretary paid a higher tax rate than he did
