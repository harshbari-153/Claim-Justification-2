Says Rick Santorum "voted to let convicted felons vote."
here we want to look at whether santorum voted to let convicted felons vote
he even voted to let convicted felons vote
romney do you believe people who were felons who served their time who have exhausted their parole and probation should they be given the right to vote santorum a former u
at the debate in south carolina santorum argued that the ad gave the misleading impression that he voted to allow felons who were still in prison to vote
when we saw the ad we were already familiar with efforts in various states to restore voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences so we didn t think that it meant that santorum wanted to allow current prisoners to vote
