Sen. Sherrod Brown’s vote helped pass "Barack Obama’s job-killing health care law, which slapped small businesses throughout Ohio with a $500 billion tax increase."
the national republican senatorial committee says the health care law slapped ohio small businesses with a billion tax increase
making suggestions in a pointed news release nrsc spokesman jahan wilcox said one of the things we expect that brown will not be discussing is his vote for barack obama s health care law which slapped small businesses throughout ohio with a billion tax increase
but will these small ohio businesses be slapped with a billion tax hike thanks to brown and others who supported the bill regardless of their order no
more intriguing than that was the nrsc s claim that the bill slapped small businesses throughout ohio with a billion tax increase
and it applied to all taxes and fees associated with what both parties are now calling obamacare not just the portion that would be paid by small businesses
