Says that President Obama said if Congress passed the economic stimulus bill, "we would have unemployment at 8 percent and no higher. And it went higher."
this is the man who said if we pass the billion stimulus bill which it turns out cost billion a billion oops we would have unemployment at percent and no higher
will obama said stimulus would cap unemployment at percent
obama is correct that many independent economists agree that the stimulus has created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has though in fairness not every economist agrees with that
so is the fact that unemployment rose even as the stimulus unfolded proof that it has failed white house officials have steadfastly maintained that the stimulus is working that even though the unemployment rate has risen above where it was projected in january it would be even worse if not for the stimulus
and how can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate got to x percent it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus the same holds true for republicans who say the rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus is working
