Says climate scientist James Hansen says "we have until perhaps 50 years from now," or maybe a little longer "and at that point, we are looking at 10, 20, 30 feet of sea-level rise."
stein said hansen predicted to feet of rise within years or maybe a little bit longer
so did a top climate scientist predict that much of a rise in about years
national climate assessment a federal project predicted between one and four feet of sea level rise by the century s end about
hansen said in the video the data records are too short but if we wait until the real world reveals itself clearly it may be too late to avoid rise of several meters and loss of all coastal cities
if greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow which they were as of according to federal data published in the study says sea level rise would become practically unavoidable probably within years
