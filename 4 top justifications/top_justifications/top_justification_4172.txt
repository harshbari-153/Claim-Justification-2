Says Barack Obama grew up in Kenya.
mike huckabee said barack obama grew up in kenya
huckabee did say in a radio interview that obama grew up in kenya and then spoke at length about the implications of that suggesting that his views of the british were shaped by a father whom he only met once and a grandfather he never met
obama did not grow up in kenya and had almost no contact with his father growing up he never met his grandfather
and one thing that i do know is his having grown up in kenya his view of the brits for example very different than the average american
in my answer i simply misspoke when i alluded to president obama growing up in and meant to say indonesia said huckabee in a statement on his website
