"I have never once raised the county tax levy -- not for seven straight years."
i would remind the governor that i have never once raised the county tax levy not for seven straight years while mr
astorino said i have never once raised the county tax levy not for seven straight years
since then westchester county s property tax levy has remained flat
million or two percent cut in the county real property tax levy
so the county portion of residents property tax bill has decreased
