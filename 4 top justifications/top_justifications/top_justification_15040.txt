we decided to check out one found on his campaign s facebook page in which he claims that the federal government mandates transexuals sic and homosexuals grabbing children in their zones in the name of airport security
from what we can find from legitimate sources the yang case does not involve transexuals sic or homosexuals grabbing children in their zones nor even transsexuals doing so
allen also sent along tsa policy statements on civil rights the screening of children and on pat downs
it contains the statement of eugene delgaudio president of public advocate under the headline we were right all along perverse court allows tsa male agent to grope women
it does involve employment law regarding the treatment involving gender identity and a voluntary settlement in which one party was a federal government agency
