"Too many" tattoos "on visible body parts" keepÂ some applicants out of the military.
other branches of the service also have restrictions on types and locations of tattoos that keep some applicants out of the military
bush said that among the reasons applicants are rejected by the military in addition to being obese or not passing the test is that some have too many tattoos on visible body parts
will too many tattoos keep you out of military jeb bush says yes
now that s not just because of the test that s also because of obesity and too many tattoos to be honest with you on visible body parts for people that are trying to get into the military
since the army updated its tattoo policy earlier this year applicants could not proceed due to tattoos
