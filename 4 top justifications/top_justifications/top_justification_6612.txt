Says his "patents in ultrasound have revolutionized modern medicine."
based on the scant evidence we were able to discover and our lack of deep knowledge in the history of ultrasound technology we are narrowing the focus to whether flinn does indeed hold patents in ultrasound technology that might have revolutionized modern medicine
but flinn s commercials flatly claim he his patents in ultrasound technology revolutionized modern medicine when the record shows he he only applied for patents several months after this congressional campaign was under way
the commercial boldly claimsthat flinn is a doctor whose patents in ultrasound have revolutionized modern medicine whose innovations have saved lives throughout the world
memphis candidate george flinn claims his patents revolutionized modern medicine
if the technologies are being employed in medicine to demonstrative salubrious effect it isn t because they are his patents because the patents have not yet been granted
