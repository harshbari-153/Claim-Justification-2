Says Austin trains are "full" at rush hour and "packed" for special events.
lee leffingwell says austin trains are full at rush hour and packed for special events
our ruling leffingwell said capital metro s trains are full during rush hour and packed for events such as sxsw and the race
capital metro s red line trains are full not only during morning and evening rush hours but packed for big events like and south by southwest
it s a tighter squeeze at rush hour with average ridership at the trains tend to have all seats full and so many standing riders that only about more can squish aboard
and how full or packed are the trains these days overall ridership has tripled since according to austin coverage particularly after the march addition of friday night and saturday trains
