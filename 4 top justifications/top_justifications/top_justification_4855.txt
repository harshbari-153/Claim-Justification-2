Says out-of-state abortion clinics "have marketed their services to minors" in states with parental consent laws.
rob portman says abortion clinics market their services to minors in states with stricter laws
were abortion providers in states actually advertising across state lines to let minors know they could come over without telling their moms or dads portman s press secretary caitlin dunn answered the question by showing us an array of ads from the internet and yellow pages
large nearby states such as new york and illinois however do not have such restrictions and providers in those states have marketed their services to minors in states with parental consent requirements
ohio and most other states require a parent s consent or notification before they will allow a minor to have an abortion
based on this and our own web searches it appeared that portman was correct in at least one regard that some abortion clinics in states that don t have laws were informing minors in other states of their options
