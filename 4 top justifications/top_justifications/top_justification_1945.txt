"The president promised to close the space gap, but he now seems intent on repeating the events that created the space gap in the first place -- putting in place a new rocket design and then trying to underfund the effort..."
posey press release went on over two years ago the president promised to close the space gap but now he seems intent on repeating the events that created the space gap in the first place putting in place a new rocket design and then trying to underfund the effort ensuring that it will never happen and ceding american leadership in space to china and russia
our ruling so back to our questions did obama promise two years ago to close the space gap has a new rocket design been put into place and is it properly funded posey is correct that obama said he intended to close the space gap and he supported man living and working in space
did obama promise two years ago to close the space gap has a new rocket design been put into place and is it properly funded obama on space during his presidential campaign obama made a stop in titusville just west of the kennedy space center where he spoke to an animated crowd about his goals for nasa
so posey is right about obama campaign pledge to close the space gap and the president himself has talked of his desire for american astronauts to aim for travel to mars by the mid
but when it comes to the space race one florida congressman is blasting the president as ceding american leadership in space to china and russia
