"Unions donâ€™t have to comply with Obamacare."
if unions don t have to comply with obamacare why should we
unions do have to comply with obamacare says crossroads gps
an ad from the republican controlled campaign group crossroads gps asserts that unions are exempt from the new health care law as a political favor from president barack obama
it gives the impression that unions are entirely exempt from the health care law which they are not
in ruling on this statement we understand that the obama administration would hardly admit to it if it were giving unions special treatment
