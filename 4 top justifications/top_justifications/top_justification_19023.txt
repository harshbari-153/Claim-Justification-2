"When I ran against incumbent President Gerald Ford, you know how much money we raised? None."
as a matter of fact when i ran against incumbent president gerald ford you know how much money we raised none
our ruling carter said on cnn that when he ran against ford in you know how much money we raised none
jimmy carter says when he ran against gerald ford he did raise any money
however he exaggerates slightly by suggesting that he and his campaign raised no money during their campaign against ford
carter is correct that like every presidential candidate until obama in he did not raise money for his own campaign committee for the general election opting instead for federal funding that came with some strings
