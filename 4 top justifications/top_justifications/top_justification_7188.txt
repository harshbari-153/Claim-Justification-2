Says President Barack Obama said when "we got bin Laden, terrorism problem solved."
so did obama as cheney claimed say we got bin laden terrorism problem solved
the question for us in this did obama declare the terrorism problem solved after special forces killed bin laden in
they still living back in the day when they claimed we got osama bin laden terrorism problem solved
we did not find any instances in which obama said threats of terrorism are solved or gone or just kaput
when kelly called him out for being wrong on iraq time and time again cheney said barack obama has stated repeatedly the terrorist threat is gone we got bin laden
