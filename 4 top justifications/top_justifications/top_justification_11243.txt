The Milwaukee County executive can sell the public "museum, the airport and the zoo" -- all on his own, without County Board approval
larson said the milwaukee county executive can sell the public museum the airport and the zoo all on his own without county board approval
can the milwaukee county executive sell airport zoo and museum on his own without county board ok
so not that it likely but does the milwaukee county executive have the power on his own to sell the milwaukee public museum general mitchell international airport and the milwaukee county zoo
in other words the county board doesn t have a say although the county executive alone couldn t sell land such as the museum the airport or the zoo
he has unilateral authority over the county board or the county board has no oversight over land sales including the museum the airport and the zoo
