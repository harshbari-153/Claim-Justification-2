Says Aaron Hernandez' daughter is, by Massachusetts law, entitled to the remainder of his $15 million NFL contract because he committed suicide during his appeal, making his conviction "null and void."
aaron hernandez committed suicide because under the state of massachussetts law if you die during a appeal of conviction the original conviction becomes null void
no aaron hernandez family isn t entitled to the rest of his nfl contract money
regardless of the court s decision the presumption that hernandez family would have been entitled to money owed from his football contract has also been disputed
this means he technically never violated the new england patriots contract thus his daughter is now entitled to the remainder of the guaranteed million the patriots owe him
it s true that a legal principle in massachusetts initially erased hernandez conviction because he died before having a chance to complete his appeal
