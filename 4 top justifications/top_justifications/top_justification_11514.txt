"I have introduced balanced budgets every year that Iâ€™ve been governor."
i have introduced balanced budgets every year that i ve been governor rauner said
so we were puzzled when rauner on monday declared to the chicago tribune editorial board i have introduced balanced budgets every year that i ve been governor
the incumbent protested that he d proposed balanced budgets every year
year after year governor rauner has introduced balanced budgets along with the reforms needed to save taxpayer dollars and put illinois back on a firm fiscal footing and year after year he has been met with resistance from those more comfortable with the status quo
but his persistence in arguing that his past budgets were all balanced despite broad and convincing evidence to the contrary inspired us to take another look
