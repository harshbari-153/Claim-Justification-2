A man at "the storming of the U.S. embassy" in Iraq visited the White House in 2011.
it true man photographed at baghdad embassy protest visited the white house in
in amiri then iraq s transportation minister did indeed visit the white house
but he is the same person who visited the white house in
this photo of that white house meeting is similar to the one that appears in the facebook post though obama is obscured by a lamp
embassy raid we find nothing indicating he led it as the post suggests it does appear he was in attendance there as well as being a white house visitor years earlier during the obama administration
