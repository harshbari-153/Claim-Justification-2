Says Gov. Scott Walker "hasn't done a public event this entire year."
scott walker has done any public events in democratic state senator says
larson said walker has done a public event this entire year
scott walker has so cocooned himself from regular folks state senate minority leader chris larson contends that he has done a public event in this entire year
larson may believe walker needs to be more open but it s ridiculous to say walker hasn t done even one public event in
so attendance is limited at some public events walker attended but not at others
