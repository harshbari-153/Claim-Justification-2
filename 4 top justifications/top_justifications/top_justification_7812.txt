AIG "said they were giving $57 million (in retention payments) to people who were being terminated."
but the fact we are checking here is whether aig plans to spend million on retention awards for people it expects to terminate in the future
in all aig committed to billion worth of retention payments
keep in mind in their filings aig recent filings they said they were giving million to people who were being terminated cummings said in an interview on good morning america on march
aig retention bonuses going to employees it plans to terminate
specifically i asked those who received retention payments in excess of or more to return at least half of those payments
