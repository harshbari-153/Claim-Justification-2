"If you go back, you can see Wayne LaPierre, who runs the NRA, testifying in front of Congress in favor of background checks 15 or 20 years ago."
and in fact if you go back you can see wayne lapierre who runs the nra testifying before congress in favor of background checks or years ago
bloomberg said if you go back you can see wayne lapierre who runs the nra testifying before congress in favor of background checks or years ago
bloomberg correct that nra s wayne lapierre once supported background checks
we wanted to revisit the history in light of the nra s typically staunch resistance to gun control efforts and the washington post s recent report that lapierre called trump to warn against pushing for background checks
in lapierre and the nra acknowledged the change in position
