republicans in the general assembly cut teacher pay so much when they took over in that even with recent pay raises we are still below pay levels said wooten who is running to unseat incumbent rick gunn in district which includes alamance county and part of guilford county
is teacher pay in north carolina still lower than it was before the great recession and if so is the state legislature at fault
more importantly his attempt to pin the full blame for the state s teacher salaries on the gop was misleading as democratic leaders were responsible for the heaviest teacher pay cuts in the wake of the recession
wooten s ad placed the blame squarely on the state s republicans but in reality both political parties have seen teacher pay rise and fall under their leadership in the last decade
