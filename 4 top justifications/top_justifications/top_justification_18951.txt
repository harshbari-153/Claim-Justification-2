Says an arts tax would provide "funding for certified arts and music teachers for every elementary school serving Portland residents."
school and arts together has said that the arts tax would provide funding for certified arts and music teachers for every elementary school serving portland residents
supporters say the tax will mean having arts educators in every city elementary school as well as better access to the arts throughout portland
on its website the schools and arts together says the tax would restore arts and music education in portland six school districts by providing stable funding for certified arts and music teachers for every elementary school serving portland residents
would a portland arts tax put an art or music teacher in every elementary school
as it stands now each of the elementary schools already has a music teacher so the art tax money would be used to preserve those positions
