"The states that have raised the minimum wage (this year) have had faster job growth than the states that havenâ€™t raised the minimum wage."
obama said the states that have raised the minimum wage have had faster job growth than the states that haven t raised the minimum wage
when you hear folks saying well if you raise the minimum wage that going to be fewer jobs it turns out the states that have raised the minimum wage have had faster job growth than the states that haven t raised the minimum wage he added
speech to think the president believes that raising the minimum wage affirmatively leads to faster job growth and then wonder if that s true
however obama goes on to say that states actually had faster job growth a stronger statement than just saying that a hike won t damage job growth
you need more time and you need to make some kind of rudimentary control for the economic trends in the states that preceded the wage hike
