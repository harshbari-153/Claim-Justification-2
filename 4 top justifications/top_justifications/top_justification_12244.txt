An impersonator in a Joe Biden mask gave an interview as Joe Biden.
do they have somebody in a biden mask
guy is clearly wearing a biden face mask
there is no evidence that someone wearing a biden mask has given interviews to the media pretending to be the presidential nominee
the masks we mostly hear about these days are face coverings to prevent the spread of not joe biden disguises so finely crafted that someone wearing one could dupe a reporter and tv audience into thinking they re the democratic presidential nominee
it shows biden mingling with other patrons and away from whatever lighting was shining on biden during the interview the shadow isn t there
