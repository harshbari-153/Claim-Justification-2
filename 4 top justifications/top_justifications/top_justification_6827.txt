"We were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States."
i don t think we are comforted by the fact that we were told there would never be a case of ebola in the united states and obviously that s not correct
mccain said we were told there would never be a case of ebola in the united states
we decided to look back and see if any official said that a case of ebola would never come to the united states
we found no instance in which an official said ebola would never make it here rather it has always been acknowledged as a possibility
although many media outlets and health care officials have urged people not to panic about ebola we could not find a single instance where someone said it would never get here
