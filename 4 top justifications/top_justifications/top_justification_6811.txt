could obama have afforded his home without rezko help the release asks
obama was not asked if he could afford to buy both of the tracts he was asked if he ever told rezko that he needed help buying both or either of the tracts
obama originally said that he could not afford to purchase the parcel of land rezko wife purchased and that the house itself was already a stretch
but obama later said that he did not need help purchasing or either of the tracts of land involved in the purchase of his chicago home
while the lots were being sold separately and the seller has confirmed that the obamas got no discount from rezko purchasing the lot next door the gop news release suggests obama on the issue of whether he could afford to buy the vacant lot purchased by rezko
