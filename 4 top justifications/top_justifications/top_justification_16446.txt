"A majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty."
i am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty
i am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty
that was similar to something he said at the first debate held in cleveland and aired by fox news in august that a majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty
cruz said at the second republican debate a majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty
at the time he said the bill was not amnesty and we rated that claim half true because of the vague nature of the term amnesty
