Says aÂ WHO proposal "portrays milk and dairy products as an obstacle to a healthy start in life."
dairy export council wrote that a who proposal portrays milk and dairy products as an obstacle to a healthy start in life
dairy export council said a who proposal wrongly portrays milk and dairy products as an obstacle to a healthy start in life
but the dairy industry is making a much broader claim saying the proposal targets milk and dairy products generally
but even with that she said to assert that the proposal casts milk as an obstacle goes too far
the proposal clearly is targeting some dairy products specifically powdered formulations as ones that work against the benefits that come from maintaining breastfeeding through a child s early years
