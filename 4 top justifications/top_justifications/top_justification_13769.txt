Says his bill, HB 97, would prevent the use of taxpayer dollars on abortions.
speaking to a house subcommittee on march gaetz explained that part of the rationale behind hb was to keep the government out of the business of funding elective abortions
charlie crist in that would prohibit the use of federal or state funding to provide abortion coverage
states could pass laws to prohibit abortion coverage in health plans offered on the state exchange if they chose
but i would think that even for those who are this elective abortions would not be the most appropriate use of public funds
abortions in the federal health care bill
