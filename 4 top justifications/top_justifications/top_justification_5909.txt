toney claimed the state crime lab under kaul is testing significantly less items than former ag brad schimel and is still taking longer to test many categories of key items in comparison to schimel including dna
in an april news release fond du lac county district attorney eric toney went on to claim that kaul is testing significantly less items than former ag brad schimel and is still taking longer to test many categories of key items in comparison to schimel including dna
in both dna areas under kaul the crime lab is handling fewer cases and taking longer with them
state crime lab doing less testing and generally taking longer than under previous ag
so toney is right that kaul is testing significantly less items than former ag brad schimel
