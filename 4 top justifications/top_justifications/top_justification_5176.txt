crist s veto also clears the way for taxpayer funding of abortion in florida
marco rubio claims gov crist veto of abortion bill clears the way for taxpayer funded abortions
but the house republicans release was wrong when it said the law would force florida taxpayers to pay for elective abortions
that was the case before crist vetoed the florida bill
for example florida house republicans were right when they said in a press release after crist veto that recent federal health care legislation gave states the opportunity to of federal provisions using tax dollars
