Despite keeping distance from national media interviewers, "I did local press all along, the last three months."
in her first interview with a national television reporter hillary clinton said i did local press all along the last three months
later clinton said she would continue to do more press and added i did local press all along the last three months because again it was interesting to see what questions the local press would be asking me
it s an exaggeration for her to say that she had been engaging with reporters at the local level for three months
she followed up with additional local media interviews in new hampshire nevada and south carolina in the days ahead
prior to that however her interactions with with local news outlets were just about as scarce as they were with national outlets
