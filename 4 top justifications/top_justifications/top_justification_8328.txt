"Kill a White on Sight" appears on Black Lives Matter/Antifa flyers.
no evidence black lives matter made kill a white on sight flyers
a post shared june on facebook shows what appears to be a flyer with images of three fists and this message kill a white on sight
a statement attributed to kailee scales managing director of black lives matter global network said it did not release any flyer with the kill a white on sight their silence is violence nor was it posted or shared on any of our social accounts
without evidence that the flyers were produced by black lives matter or antifa we rate the statement falsethe post says this is what is being handed out at black life matters and antifa rally how much longer are we gon na take this
