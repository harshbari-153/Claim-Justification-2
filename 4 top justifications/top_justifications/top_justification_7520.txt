Solar panel farms cause "hundreds and thousands" of birds to "hit that magnified sun, explode in flame ... (This) is going to bring the nation down."
solar farms kill thousands of birds but not as many as fossil fuel plants
they were anticipating that there would be hundreds and thousands of what they would call flamers because when the birds fly through if they survive the windmills then they hit that magnified sun explode in flame and down they go bird guts all over the mirrors
comes from photovoltaic panels not concentrated solar power towers like the one at the ivanpah plant that created the conditions that fatally harmed these birds
thousands of birds have died after flying over these kinds of solar power plants but gohmert s assertion misses important context
the estimated number of birds killed by fossil fuel power plants through collisions electrocution and poisoning actually dwarfs those attributed to solar and wind
