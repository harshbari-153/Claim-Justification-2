Mergers and integration in agribusiness "squeeze" family farms, and "the result is that farmers are getting a record-low amount of every dollar Americans spend on food."
warren said that mergers and integration in agribusiness squeeze family farms and the result is that farmers are getting a amount of every dollar americans spend on food
the result is that farmers are getting a amount of every dollar americans spend on food food prices aren t going down and agribusiness ceos and other corporate executives are raking it in
mergers mean that farmers have fewer and fewer choices for buying and selling while vertical integration has meant that big agribusinesses face less competition throughout the chain and thus capture more and more of the profits warren wrote march
but a declining share of the food dollar going to farms does not mean farmers are worse off
on top of that even for food bought at the grocery store american habits put the squeeze on farmers
