"More than 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States."
more than percent of the guns recovered in mexico come from the united states many from gun shops that lay in our shared border president barack obama said on a visit to mexico on april
in fact percent of the firearms recovered in mexico and which are then successfully traced were determined to have originated from various sources within the continental u
but we think obama also mischaracterizes the statistic some when he says percent of the guns recovered in mexico come from the united states
according to the article a large percentage of the guns recovered in mexico do not get sent back to the u
therefore the writers conclude only percent of guns found at mexican crime scenes have been traced to the united states
