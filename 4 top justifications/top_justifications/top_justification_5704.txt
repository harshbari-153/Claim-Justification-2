"Only a court can decide that somebody is incompetent to vote" -- the state Election Commission "cannot force facilities, private facilities, to allow special voting deputies" inside.
wolfe said only a court can decide that somebody is incompetent to vote the state election commission can not force facilities private facilities to allow special voting deputies inside
is wolfe right that only a court can decide that somebody is incompetent to vote and the commission can not force facilities private facilities to allow special voting deputies inside
i mean the commission can not force facilities private facilities to allow special voting deputies or anyone into a private care facility
i am not aware of any statute or court decision that expressly empowers the elections commission to compel private care facilities to allow in special voting deputies
and i also think it overlooks the fact that only a court can decide that somebody is incompetent to vote
