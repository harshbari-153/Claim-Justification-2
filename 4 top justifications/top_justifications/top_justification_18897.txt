if you rent a to move your company it costs twice as much to go from san francisco to austin than the other way around because you can t find enough trucks to flee the golden state perry said with a grin
rick perry correct that trucks cost half as much to rent going from austin to san francisco than the other way around
for that truck the francisco rate was percent of the rate for renting such a truck and driving the other way
