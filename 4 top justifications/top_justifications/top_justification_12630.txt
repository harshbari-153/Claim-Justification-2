"California has a personal belief exemption to any new vaccine added to the schedule after June 2015 for public and private daycare, preschool and K-12."
california has a personal belief exemption to any new vaccine added to the schedule after june for public and private daycare preschool and
until then california had technically required these vaccinations for children but had allowed parents to opt out for any reason with personal belief exemptions making it one of the more lenient states in the country for vaccination mandates
no california does not have a personal belief exemption for vaccines for kids
the law includes a clause that gives the california department of public health the ability to add mandated vaccinations to the current schedule
in short personal belief exemptions do not currently exist for any mandated vaccination in california and there is only one process that would require personal belief exemptions to be offered for any new shots
