"We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check."
kelly said we sell percent of our guns without a background check
we sell percent of our guns without a background check kelly said during cnn s state of the union on oct
there s debate among researchers on whether the percent figure still holds true today and cook and ludwig have both said that no one knows the current percentage of guns sold without a background check
robert spitzer a suny cortland political science professor and author of the politics of gun control noted that the background check statistic is notoriously slippery because gun sales that don t go through a federally licensed seller are as you would expect not subject to formal record keeping
so why is the most recent statistic on gun purchases without background checks about two decades old there s very little funding for research on gun violence
