hegar said in texans did not have health insurance coverage before the pandemic and now nearly in texans under the age of don t have access to health care insurance
how many texans can t access health insurance coverage during the pandemic
nearly in texans under the age of don t have access to health care insurance because of the record unemployment and because of our health care model that is failing texas
so even though an estimated in texans will now be without health insurance coverage the actual number of people who are uninsured and don t have access to healthcare insurance is likely even lower
the number of texans without access to health insurance during the pandemic is harder to pin down but her nearly in remark reflects the latest available estimates
