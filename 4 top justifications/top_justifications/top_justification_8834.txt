The non-profit group Feeding America is lying when it claims "that one in five kids is fighting starvation daily" in the United States.
in this we focus on huber s statement that feeding america misled the public when it said that one in five kids is fighting starvation daily
huber said that feeding america was lying when it said kids were starving in america
huber who is a marketing consultant and not a post employee then challenged feeding america s nonsensical claim that one in five kids is fighting starvation daily
to the casual reader feeding america s claim that one in five children faces hunger might sound as though one in five kids actually goes hungry
we ll get into the federal data in just a bit but beyond denying that feeding america speaks of starvation fraser also denied that his group ever used the line about kids going to bed hungry
