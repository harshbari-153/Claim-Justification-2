"There are, literally, two pharmaceutical lobbyists for every member of Congress."
klobuchar said there are literally two pharmaceutical lobbyists for every member of congress
but she noted what she would be up against there are literally two pharmaceutical lobbyists for every member of congress
the second part of klobuchar s statement that drug company lobbyists own congress brings up another element of this issue in washington money and lobbying go hand in hand
we found that there are more than twice as many pharma lobbyists per member of congress if one looks at the broader category that includes representatives of health products but only
that category goes beyond just prescription drugs to include lobbyists for medical device makers and producers of health products
