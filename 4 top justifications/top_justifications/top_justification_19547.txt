"This new gas tax does not increase (road) capacity anywhere in the state. It will build no new lanes of freeways. If Californians didn’t like their traffic before, they’re going to like it even less when they’re stuck in the exact same traffic and paying more for their gas."
republican assemblyman and candidate for governor travis allen claimed california s gas tax increase won t build new roads or freeway lanes nor will it ease traffic congestion
if californians didn t like their traffic before they re going to like it even less when they re stuck in the exact same traffic and paying more for their gas
this new gas tax does not increase road capacity anywhere in the state
since allen s statement goes the furthest in claiming the tax increase builds no new lanes and won t ease traffic we decided to hit the gas on a fact check
he claimed in a june article on the repeal the gas tax campaign website that the increase does nothing to solve california s notorious traffic woes
