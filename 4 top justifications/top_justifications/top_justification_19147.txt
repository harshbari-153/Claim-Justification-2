Says the Democratic leadership and presidential candidates "are mourning the loss of (Qassem) Soleimani"
haley said the democratic leadership and presidential candidates are mourning the loss of soleimani
the only ones mourning the loss of soleimani are our democrat leadership and democrat presidential candidates
the only ones that are mourning the loss of soleimani are our democrat leadership and our democrat presidential candidates
a response from haley s spokesman included such a broad interpretation of the word mourning to render its definition meaningless saying democrats are effectively mourning soleimani by questioning whether the united states is better off after his killing
several other democratic presidential candidates also made a point of criticizing soleimani
