Says his executive order requiring young girls to be vaccinated against HPV wasn't mandatory.
perry issued an executive order not a piece of legislation as he said requiring the texas health and human services commission to adopt rules mandating all girls entering sixth grade to receive a vaccination against the types of hpv a virus that causes most cases of cervical cancer and genital warts
ultimately the governor issued an order for the health and human services executive commissioner to adopt rules that mandate the age appropriate vaccination of all female children for hpv prior to admission to the sixth grade
we wondered if the diocese policy in favor of requiring immunizations would have extended to refusing the form for girls subject to the hpv vaccination
perry says the hpv vaccine he mandated would have been optional
also unknown whether every catholic school would have allowed students subject to perry order to abstain from the three hpv shots in the vaccination series
