Says Donald Trump "has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain arenâ€™t heroes."
clinton accused trump in a speech thursday of having the gall to say that prisoners of war like john mccain aren t heroes
trump did in fact say that john mccain is not a hero despite his pow record although trump has since taken those comments back and called mccain a hero
clinton would certainly be correct accusing trump of saying mccain is not a war hero which he does right off the bat
however clinton s speech was intended to more broadly attack trump s national security credentials yet trump has never made the general statement that pows are not heroes even if his comments did insinuate it
trump he s not a war hero
