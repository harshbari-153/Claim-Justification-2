Says "massive floods" led to Legionnaires’ disease outbreaks at the Quincy Veterans’ Home.
while speaking to state employees and lawmakers about illinois budgetary priorities rauner claimed massive floods led to a deadly legionnaires disease outbreak that hit the quincy veterans home during his first year in office
subsequent legionnaires outbreaks at the home sickened more residents
a few months earlier we rated as half true an attempt by rauner to explain away the legionnaires problems at quincy by stressing that the bacteria lurks in most illinois water systems
spokeswoman rachel bold said the administration is exploring various theories for both the cause of and remedy to the outbreaks and pointed to several studies on the correlation between increased rainfall and a heightened risk of legionnaires disease
more to the point criticism of the governor in respect to quincy centers not on what led to the initial legionnaires outbreak but how slow his administration was to respond while seniors were sickened and many died
