Greta Thunberg "going on hunger strike until Trump is removed."
the headline of a story on a web page titled washington news press claims that greta thunberg the climate activist from sweden has decided to go on a hunger strike until president donald trump is removed from office
no greta thunberg isn t protesting trump with a hunger strike
thunberg has not announced a hunger strike in protest of trump
if the premise of that story doesn t seem suspect perhaps this quote attributed to thunberg will help you reconsider this is what ghandi sic did
the balance of a human life will outweigh the ignorance and douchebaggery of trump
