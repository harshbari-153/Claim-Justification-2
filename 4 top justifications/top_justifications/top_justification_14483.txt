Congress will begin its recess "without having allocated one penny" to fight Zika.
we were curious whether congress recessed without allocating a single penny to deal with the zika virus
clinton said that congress had not allocated one penny to fight zika
clinton congress has one penny to fight zika
congress needs to provide the funds to fight zika now
the president asked for this funding over a month ago but on saturday congress will begin a break without having allocated one penny
