"I do provide universal health care."
well let talk about health care right now because the fact of the matter is that i do provide universal health care
clinton health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated forced them to get health care
so is it fair for obama to call his plan universal well not really
he says universal but it no guarantee
before jumping into this fray it important to note that when it comes to health care the two democratic presidential candidates have a lot in common
