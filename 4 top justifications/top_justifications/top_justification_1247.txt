on april an instagram post shared a screenshot of an october article headlined canada s new law allows government to take children away if parents don t accept kids gender identity
canadian government doesn t separate children from parents due to gender identity disputes
they can not remove children from their families solely based on the parents refusing to accept their child s gender identity or expression
this change aligned the child welfare laws with ontario s human rights code
