no this photo doesn t show a frozen uss al gore global warming research vessel
the boat is labeled uss al gore global warming research vessel
but there is no uss al gore global warming research vessel
as snow and ice blankets much of the country an image of a frozen boat in a harbor has spread on social media
but it s appeared online for more than years and doing a reverse image search some posts describe it as a boat in lac leman in versoix switzerland after an ice storm
