Obama's plan for health care reform "ends exorbitant out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles or co-pays."
but ending exorbitant expenses deductibles or may be in the eye of the beholder
axelrod is correct that the main health care reform bill requires insurance companies to abide by yearly caps on how much they can charge for expenses
the main health care reform bill in congress does set annual limits on expenses
one of his claims is that refom ends exorbitant expenses deductibles or insurance companies will have to abide by yearly caps on how much they can charge for expenses
if you get a new individual policy through the health care exchange it would have to comply right away
