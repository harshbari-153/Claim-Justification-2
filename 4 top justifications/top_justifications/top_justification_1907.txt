"For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America."
for the amount of money hillary clinton would like to spend on refugees we could rebuild every inner city in america
trump said that clinton wants to spend hundreds of billions on refugees and for that money we could rebuild every inner city in america
but as you ll see whatever number clinton could conceivably spend resettling refugees come nowhere near what it would cost to rebuild america s urban centers
hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle middle eastern refugees in the united states on top of the current record level of immigration trump said
trump wrong that clinton refugee plan would cost more than rebuilding all inner cities
