"All of Texas is conservative, except a little bit of Austin."
hannity said all of texas is conservative except a little bit of austin
all right hannity said amid shouts all of texas is conservative except a little bit of austin
sean hannity incorrect that of texas conservative save a bit of austin
we focused on hannity s larger point that the rest of texas is conservative
however the state s border counties and biggest cities not just austin lean democratic while the ut poll showed the majority of all voters as something other than conservative
