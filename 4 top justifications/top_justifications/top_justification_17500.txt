Says President Barack Obama has "been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years."
cruz said that obama has been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years
the part of cruz s comment that caught our eye was that obama has been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years
that was about six years before obama took office
we found that cruz has a point that the united states has seen jobs go overseas during the seven years that obama has been in office
so jobs have clearly been moving overseas for many years even if the trend predated obama and occurred for reasons other than his policies
