Algeria "wanted to be taken off of the terror list" at the time it made an unreported donation to the Clinton Foundation.
i think it was algeria maybe that had given a donation that went unreported at a time when they wanted to be taken off of the terror list in the state department scarborough said
scarborough says algeria donated to clinton foundation when it wanted off list
the clinton foundation takes the check and then just out of nowhere the state department then decides well they are going to take algeria off the list
it was unsolicited and went to the clinton foundation haiti relief fund where the entire amount of algeria s contribution was distributed as aid in haiti
scarborough was trying to recall the details of a news story about clinton foundation donations from foreign governments when he brought up algeria s donation to the foundation to try getting off the terror list
