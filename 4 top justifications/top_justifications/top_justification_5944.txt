Forty-six states have a line-item veto for the governor.
it lists states in which the governor has a veto for all bills or at least for bills appropriating money
is chafee correct that a large majority of states give their governors the veto we thought we d test his knowledge of the states
but if you can veto like other states have then that becomes a public discussion about that narrow issue and the governor might be able to prevail
governor lincoln chafee said governors in states have veto power
so back to our test of chafee s claim that states have a veto
