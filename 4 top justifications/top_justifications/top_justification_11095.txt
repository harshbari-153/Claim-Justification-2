"The Stupak Amendment doesn't just say you can't use your federal insurance subsidy to pay for an abortion, it says, if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money."
the stupak amendment does just say you ca use your federal insurance subsidy to pay for an abortion it says if you getting a federal subsidy of any kind you not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money
whether by design or not maddow hewed quite closely to the actual language of the amendment when she said that if you getting a federal subsidy of any kind you not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money
maddow says stupak amendment bars those with subsidies from getting abortion coverage
specifically the amendment says that people who buy subsidized insurance on the exchange can not buy an insurance plan that includes abortion coverage
however the amendment does allow people purchasing insurance on the exchange to choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without federal subsidies
