"If you're a terrorist you can't fly," but "an assault weapon you can buy."
how ironic that if you a terrorist you ca fly but quite moronic that an assault weapon you can buy
moore said if you a terrorist you ca fly but an assault weapon you can buy
the second part of her claim that terrorists can buy assault weapons goes a bit too far in that not all of the people on the terrorist watchlist are terrorists
the first part of moore s claim that terrorists can t fly is pretty straightforward
in a poem gwen moore says terrorists can be banned from flying but can buy assault weapons
