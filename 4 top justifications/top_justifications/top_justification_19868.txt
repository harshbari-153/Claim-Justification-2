"Mayor Giuliani made New York City what's known as a 'sanctuary city,' where illegal aliens were allowed to come. And he instructed the leaders of the city not to enforce the law, not to enforce immigration law."
but romney claim that giuliani made new york city what known as a city where illegal aliens were allowed to come suggests that the big apple was a unique safe haven where they would be free from deportation
