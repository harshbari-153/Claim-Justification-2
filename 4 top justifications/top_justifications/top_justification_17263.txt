"The right-to-work states have much lower level of unemployment than the union states do."
so where does that leave us in terms of o reilly s claim he said that states have much lower level of unemployment than the union states do
of the states with the lowest unemployment there was a tie for place eight were states
the states have much lower level of unemployment than the union states do o reilly said while interviewing caroline heldman a political scientist at occidental college
