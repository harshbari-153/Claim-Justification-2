North Carolina has "one of the fastest growing populations as well as the fastest growing economy in the country."
these efforts have positioned north carolina as one of the fastest growing populations as well as the fastest growing economy in the country
instead we will look just at whether it s true that north carolina has one of the fastest growing populations as well as fastest growing economy in the country as mccrory claimed
mccrory is correct that north carolina has one of the fastest growing populations
mccrory is right that north carolina has one of the fastest growing populations
so while we do know who currently has the economy the data does show that north carolina s growth hasn t been as dominant recently
