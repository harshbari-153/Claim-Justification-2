"Ninety-eight percent of the American people will not see their taxes go up" due to the House health care bill.
msnbc host ed schultz fired back arguing that percent of the american people will not see their taxes go up because of this bill
so schultz is right that less than percent indeed less than percent of americans would be subject to the millionaire tax at least at the beginning
schultz says health care bill will only tax top percent
we looked at analyses of the house bill and found one big tax the millionaire tax and a few more modest ones that would hit individuals
because many people use medical devices in any given year this tax would likely hit more than percent of the population even accounting for overlap with the other taxes included in the bill
