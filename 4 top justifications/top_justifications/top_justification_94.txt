"Overwhelming Democrat and Republican votes" in 2011 for legislation in two special sessions on jobs demonstrated the bipartisan nature of the Wisconsin Legislature.
our rating walker said bipartisanship was on display in overwhelming democrat and republican votes in for legislation passed in two special legislative sessions on jobs
if a couple democrats join all the republicans on a vote is that really bipartisan in a highly technical sense maybe but in common usage it means both parties are supportive
a total of bills identified as part of the two special jobs sessions came to a vote in at least one full chamber of the legislature in of those split almost exactly along party lines with republicans united and able to easily push through bills despite united opposition
we found a decidedly mixed record of bipartisan votes
we checked the legislature s official voting records and found a decidedly mixed record of bipartisan votes
