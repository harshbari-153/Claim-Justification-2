"Phoenix, Ariz., is the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world."
he said phoenix is called the kidnapping capital of the united states because the illegal immigrants who are brought to phoenix for distribution throughout the country are held in drop houses and they are mistreated horribly treated
while phoenix has experienced hundreds of kidnappings over the past few years we could find reliable evidence to confirm they are number two in the world
also while abc s story specifies the number of kidnappings that have occurred in phoenix since it doesn t say how many kidnappings were reported in other cities
if they could they speculate other cities would prove to have more kidnappings than arizona capital
state courtney combs says phoenix is no for kidnapping in the world
