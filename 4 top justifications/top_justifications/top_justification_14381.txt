a meme on social media suggests hillary clinton had something to do with the oklahoma city bombing because she was to be indicted in a scandal four days after the bombing but the blast destroyed documents related to the case
let s cut to the chase there is no evidence to support the suggestion that clinton then first lady was to be indicted in the whitewater case or had anything to do with the bombing carried out by timothy mcveigh that killed people on april
but nowhere in the investigation files does it say that indictments against hillary clinton or bill clinton were pending but made impossible when incriminating documents were destroyed in the oklahoma city bombing
it is accurate that the clintons were investigated in the as part of the whitewater scandal a failed real estate investment project they took part in with jim mcdougal a real estate entrepreneur
