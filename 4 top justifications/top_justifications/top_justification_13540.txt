Wisconsinâ€™s concealed-carry permit rules demand more proof than other states that safety training requirements are met, rendering "all existing (training) certificates insufficient" as part of the permit application
nra says wisconsin s permit rules require more proof than other states
some of those rumors were unfounded permit applicants need not fire a gun as in minnesota and training must be with a certified instructor
nevertheless despite the specific rules that drew criticism from gun advocates wisconsin s overall law is still in the top for ease of access to permits according to nik clark head of wisconsin carry inc
a final point we found that evaluating the nra assertion that no training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the wisconsin doj demands is a matter of how you read the statement
based on our check of permit rules around the country it s not hard to find states that require some of the same things wisconsin requires
