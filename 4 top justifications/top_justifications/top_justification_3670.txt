CNN is recycling crisis actors in reports about a man dying in Afghanistan in 2021 and at the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting in 2022.
this is what happened with one man s image which has been used multiple times to make false claims that cnn is recycling crisis actors in its coverage of major breaking news events
no cnn didn t report that the same man died in afghanistan and uvalde
the user told people to wake up and said cnn is always sloppy and recycle the same crisis actors
the image on the right shows a screenshot of a bogus august tweet from cnn afghanistan an account with the handle cnnafghan announcing gores was killed
see this guy died twice once in afghanistan in and then again yesterday at the fake elementary school shooting one facebook post said
