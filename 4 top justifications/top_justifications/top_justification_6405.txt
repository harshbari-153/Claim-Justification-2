"We have 25 million Americans out of work."
mitt romney said that we have million americans out of work
mitt romney says there are million americans out of work
million americans who are marginally attached to the labor force meaning they d be ready to work if a job became available and another
however romney s use of the term out of work seems to be a stretch when about of the million americans out of work are actually working
million americans who are working only for economic reasons
