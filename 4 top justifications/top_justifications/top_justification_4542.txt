"More people have died of an opioid overdose in North Carolina in recent years than have died of COVID."
but more people have died of an opioid overdose in north carolina in recent years than have died of covid
is it true that more people have died of an opioid overdose in north carolina in recent years than have died from the coronavirus
stein said more people have died of an opioid overdose in north carolina in recent years than have died of covid
but we feel like it s a stretch for stein to compare north carolina s opioid deaths over the last years to covid deaths in north carolina which total more than over months
to put that in perspective north carolina recorded deaths just in nearly three times as many deaths as from opioid overdoses in the same period
