"The 9/11 Memorial in NYC was just defaced with graffiti."
no the memorial in new york city wasn t defaced
for the record the lincoln memorial wasn t covered in graffiti president donald trump s star on the hollywood walk of fame wasn t destroyed this vietnam memorial wasn t defaced by black lives matters demonstrators and these war memorials weren t either
a june facebook post since deleted expresses disbelief that americans still support demonstrations over the death of george floyd in police custody after the memorial in nyc was just defaced with graffiti
this isn t the first incorrect claim about vandalism during protests that we ve checked
but we found no news coverage of such vandalism at the memorial in new york city
