On Obama, "The press warns the 'Taxman Cometh.'"
we at politifact have looked repeatedly at mccain blanket claims that obama plan would translate to higher taxes and have found them misleading
so there no argument that for the wealthiest americans the taxman cometh under obama plan
in its response to the ad the obama campaign cites a host of stories and editorials from major newspapers and political web sites that conclude obama plan would result in a tax cut for most middle class americans
lastly exhibit c obama taxes a for economic disaster
the editorial speaks to obama call for a windfall profits tax on oil companies
