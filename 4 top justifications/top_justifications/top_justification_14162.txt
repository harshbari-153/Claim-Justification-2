"Higher beer production and higher consumption go hand-in-hand."
higher beer production and higher consumption go
but the question here is whether making more beer makes people drink more
we looked at the regulation claim in a separate item but we also were curious whether higher beer production led to higher consumption
stargel said higher beer production and higher consumption go
we know that higher beer production means lower beer prices
