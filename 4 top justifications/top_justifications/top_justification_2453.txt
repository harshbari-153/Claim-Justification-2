The Chris Hani Baragwanath in South Africa is "the worldâ€™s third-biggest hospital."
the chris hani baragwanath hospital is large but not as large as it believes
so chris hani baragwanath hospital ranks at least fourth not third
the chris hani baragwanath hospital has been in the black township of soweto in johannesburg since world war ii when it opened to care for british soldiers
no south africa hospital is not the in the world
those numbers clearly mean a lot to management because on the hospital s website right under its name is the statement the world s hospital in south africa
