budd s ad said kathy manning got million of your tax dollars plus
million a year to kathy manning and her husband filling the manning s swanky hotel and their own french castle
and the million represents the entire cost of the parking deck project not gross profit for manning or her husband
it concludes from her castle it s no surprise queen kathy doesn t care about doubling parking rates for workers and commuters because kathy manning makes government work for her and we pay the price
budd falsely accuses manning of getting in taxpayer money
