as insurance commissioner steve poizner pledged to block immigrant children from ever getting medical health insurance
ricardo lara claimed in newspaper ads that his opponent in california s insurance commissioner race steve poizner pledged to block immigrant children from ever getting medical health insurance when poizner previously held the state post
in the ad poizner doesn t specifically bring up health benefits but instead makes the blanket pledge to stop all benefits for undocumented californians
poizner did make a general promise to block benefits for undocumented californians though that was eight years ago in a republican primary race for governor
poizner s campaign did not respond to three requests from politifact california on where he stands on the specific issue of providing health benefits to undocumented children
