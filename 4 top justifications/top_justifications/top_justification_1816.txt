"If we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any."
if we stopped testing right now we have very few cases if any
and what about the president s assertion that if we stopped testing right now we d have very few cases or none at all
if you do test you do have any cases trump said at a june roundtable discussion at the white house
we re seeing a lot of cases because we re testing it just doesn t ring true kates said
but those tests yield far more positive cases in the united states
