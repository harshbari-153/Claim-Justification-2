"They didnâ€™t even put up a fight against SALT"
they didn t even put up a fight against salt could have won
the democrats who were vocal in speaking against the salt cap were in the minority party and had little influence in the white house house of representatives and senate all controlled by republicans
if anyone didn t put up a fight in new york it could have been the republicans who could have used their influence as members of the majority party to push to eliminate the cap but voted in favor of the tax legislation
some of the new york and new jersey republicans who favored the law told the new york times that they blamed state government not the tax bill for the problems the salt cap would create
what he said about salt is unbelievable cuomo said
