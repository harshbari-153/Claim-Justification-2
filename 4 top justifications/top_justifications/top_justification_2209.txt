Video of man using an air-quality monitor proves that people are "not getting enough oxygen" while wearing masks
in a video on facebook a man uses an monitor to prove that people are not getting enough oxygen while wearing masks
the man in the video uses an monitor to measure the oxygen saturation under his mask before determining that wearing a mask leads to dangerously low oxygen intake
the man pulls off his mask and explains that if you are getting headaches and stuff like that there s why because you re not getting enough oxygen
the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in a mask are constantly changing as humans breathe frequently and quickly about to breaths per minute when at rest
measuring oxygen in a mask is complicated
