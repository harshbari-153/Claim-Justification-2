Palin said stimulus money for weatherization required "universal energy building codes for Alaska, kind of a one-size-fits-all building code that isn't going to work up there in Alaska."
palin was specifically concerned with a provision in the stimulus it is section as she will refer it later that ties the energy efficiency money to assurances that the state or local governments will implement a building energy code for residential buildings that meets or exceeds the most recently published international energy conservation code or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings as well as a building energy code or codes for commercial buildings throughout the state that meets or exceeds the standard
million in federal stimulus money for weatherization and other projects to make new and existing homes and buildings more energy efficient
so palin chief of staff wrote to the department of energy to get some clarification about what exactly alaska would be committing itself to if it accepted the money
as for palin claims of building codes chalk wrote that the provision provides flexibility with regard to building codes and expressly includes standards other than those cited so long as the standards achieve equivalent energy savings
i do think that it would be a healthy thing for our state to adopt because it would be a federal mandate fixed centralized government telling alaskan communities that have opted out of building codes for the most part
