for the first time in a century a citizenship question was not included in
the previous administration under president barack obama really was the first time that we didn t ask a question meadows said in a question to ross
but meadows claim that was the first time that we didn t ask a question gets the history wrong since the census bureau asked about citizenship that year via the acs which effectively replaced the long form and was sent to a sample of households
meadows spokesman ben williamson said the congressman was talking about the first time the decennial census was without a citizenship question on either the long form or short form
