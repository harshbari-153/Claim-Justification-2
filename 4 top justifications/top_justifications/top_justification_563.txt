John Kitzhaber is the only pro-choice candidate in the race for governor.
planned parenthood pac of oregon sent out a letter this month claiming that democrat john kitzhaber is the only candidate in the race for governor
certainly kitzhaber is more adamant about his stance on abortion and reproductive rights
he said he s open to restrictions but doesn t have an agenda to roll back reproductive rights
he didn t fill out their questionnaire and the group declined to recommend much less endorse him in the general election
and when he was governor he vetoed a bill that would have required physicians to notify parents before providing abortion care to minors
