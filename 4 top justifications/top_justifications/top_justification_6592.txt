"Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office."
that s one of the reasons why almost every country on earth sees america as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when i took office
obama said almost every country on earth sees america as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when i took office
mostly true obama says world opinion of better now than eight years ago
does the world really like us more now than they did eight years ago
the president is putting words into pollsters mouths when he specifically says strength and respect but he s generally right that world opinion of the united states has improved
