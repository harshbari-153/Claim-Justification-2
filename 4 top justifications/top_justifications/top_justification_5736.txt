Says President Donald Trump "is still yet to say anything as the president of the United States about bounties on American troops."
clinton said trump is still yet to say anything as the president of the united states about bounties on american troops
i mean he is still yet to say anything as the president of the united states about bounties on american troops
while the white house has said trump was never orally briefed warnings that a russian intelligence unit placed bounties on american forces appeared in the president s daily brief according to multiple news reports
politifact decided to whether clinton was right that trump hasn t said anything on the matter
later that day trump repeated that there was no corroborating evidence and that he was never briefed because any info that they may have had did not rise to that level
