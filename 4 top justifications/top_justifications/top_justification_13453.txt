Says Kelli Ward hosted a town hall on "chemtrail conspiracy theories" and is open to sponsoring chemtrails legislation.
no kelli ward is a chemtrails conspiracy theorist
ward did host a town hall on chemtrails but she has not expressed belief in chemtrails
a senate leadership fund ad said ward hosted a town hall on chemtrails and was willing to sponsor legislation on it
ward wasted your tax dollars for a town hall on chemtrail conspiracy theories the attack ad posted aug
calling ward chemtrail kelli repeatedly and saying she has her head in the clouds with crazy ideas wrongly suggests she believes in the conspiracy theory
