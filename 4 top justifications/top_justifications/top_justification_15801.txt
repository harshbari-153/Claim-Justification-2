Rob Portman shares "radical, ideological views" toward women.
ohio democratic party says rob portman shares radical idological views toward women
politifact ohio listened to the rest of portman s comments about the amendment to see if they supported the claim that he holds radical ideological views toward women
but for the ohio democratic party to accuse portman of holding radical ideological views on the basis of comments in an interview that were anything but inflammatory and a vote that clearly split the senate is itself an extreme characterization
could every one of those senators hold radical ideological views toward women we do not doubt the sincerity of either side on this issue
according to a news release the ohio democrats issued on june with multiple claims one of which we have addressed already portman s vote on the blunt amendment showed that he shares romney s and mandel s radical ideological view toward women
