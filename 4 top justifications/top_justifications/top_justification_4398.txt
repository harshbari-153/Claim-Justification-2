Says as secretary of state she was reserving judgment about the Trans-Pacific Partnership and "hoped it would be the gold standard."
clinton said when she was secretary of state she was reserving judgment but hoped the partnership would be the gold standard
i did say when i was secretary of state three years ago that i hoped it would be the gold standard clinton said
clinton s phrasing that she said she hoped it would be the gold standard implies that she was undecided on the tpp
clinton said this tpp sets the gold standard in trade agreements which is a more confident claim than if she had said she hoped it would meet that standard
because tpp negotiations are still ongoing it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement
