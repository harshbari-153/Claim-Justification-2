makes three claims about the democrats impeachment resolution that the rules do not allow any witness to be called unless the witness is approved by adam schiff do not allow involvement of the president s legal counsel and do not allow any witness to be questioned unless the question is approved by adam schiff
a facebook post claimed impeachment rules passed by house democrats do not allow republicans to call and question witnesses without schiff s permission and that the resolution prohibits the involvement of trump s lawyers
the impeachment resolution says that if schiff were to refuse a request for additional witnesses republicans can bring the matter to a vote by the entire intelligence committee
the house resolution does not say schiff must approve all questions during impeachment proceedings
the democrats resolution does not require questions of witnesses to first be approved by schiff
