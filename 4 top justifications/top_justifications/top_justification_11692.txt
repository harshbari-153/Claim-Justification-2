Denies that he said the Obama campaign "played the race card."
nbc sir what did you mean yesterday when you said that the obama campaign was playing the race card on you
on april clinton gave a provocative interview to national public radio affiliate whyy in which he said the obama campaign played the race card on me
clinton was asked to explain an intriguing accusation he made against the obama campaign and responded by saying he did say it
and this was used out of context and twisted for political purposes by the obama campaign to try to breed resentment elsewhere
i think that they played the race card on me
