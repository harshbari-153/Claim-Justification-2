Says "there is no" COVID-19 virus.
facebook users are claiming there is no coronavirus that s ridiculously wrong
in a march post a facebook user said the coronavirus doesn t actually exist
is a novel or new coronavirus meaning it had not been previously identified
there is no virus the user wrote in all capital letters
to claim that the virus at the center of the pandemic does not exist as the facebook post does is inaccurate and ridiculous
