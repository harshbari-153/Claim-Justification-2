Says Hillary Clinton said the Veterans Affairs scandal is "over-exaggerated." "She said she was satisfied with what was going on."
trump said clinton said the veterans affairs scandal is and she said she was satisfied with what was going on
did hillary clinton say she was satisfied with veterans administration
i telling you this is she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the veterans administration
this reading of clinton s comments about the problems facing veterans health care is misleading and leaves out the full story
we wondered if in fact clinton had used those words to downplay reports about veterans waiting for months to get medical care
