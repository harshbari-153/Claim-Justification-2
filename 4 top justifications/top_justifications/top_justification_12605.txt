President Barack Obamaâ€™s Fiscal Year 2013 budget proposal "couldn't get support from either party in the House or the Senate."
further ayotte said obama s budget couldn t get support she never used the word votes
obama s fiscal year budget proposal introduced in february never reached the house floor for a vote
the amendment based on spending and revenue numbers from the president s budget fell in the house and two months later a similar motion concurrent resolution failed the senate by a count
despite ayotte s claim that the budget received no support from either party in the house or senate obama s budget drew immediate praise from some leading democrats
but it certainly does mean that the people who voted against it don t support the president s budget
