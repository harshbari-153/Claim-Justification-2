"Evangelical leader says those who oppose Trump could be ‘punished’ with gay child."
com carried the headline evangelical leader says those who oppose trump could be punished with gay child
a fake news story claimed evangelical leader kenneth copeland said christians who don t support president donald trump could face punishment from a vengeful god who would potentially give the unfaithful a homosexual child
but again copeland didn t say god would punish trump opponents by affecting the sexual orientation of their offspring
if christians don t support trump they are risking the wrath of god the story quoted copeland as saying
they could be punished with barrenness poverty or even having a gay child
