"North Carolina spends $855 less per student than it did before the Great Recession, and we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation."
north carolina spends less per student than it did before the great recession and we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation cooper s plan reads
does north carolina spend less per student than most states
so what about cooper s claim that north carolina spends less per student than before the recession
but cooper is still right in the general sense that north carolina s public schools have less purchasing power than before the recession and that almost every other state spends more money on education per student than north carolina
that backs up cooper s claim that we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation
