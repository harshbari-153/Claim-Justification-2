California "cut about $1.3 billion in child care (during the recession). Weâ€™ve only reinvested about $300 million."
mostly true california has restored only a fraction of in child care cuts
billion in child care programs during the recession and has reinvested only million since
that made us wonder was rendon right when he said the state has reinvested just million in child care or has california done more
while there are questions about the numbers rendon used experts we contacted agreed that rendon is correct that california is nowhere close to restoring all the child care funds cut during the recession
a very strict look at how much has been reinvested shows california put back million of that
