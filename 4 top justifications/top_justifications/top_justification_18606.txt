Says Rick Perry's proposal on driver licenses and high school dropouts has been state law since 1989.
bill white says rick perry proposal on denying dropouts driver license has been law since
rick perry proposal regarding high school dropouts and drivers licenses has a glaring weakness
but white overlooked the fact that perry did propose a change aimed at toughening the law that was in place for the past years to cause dropouts to lose their licenses at renewal time
in west texas perry said i have proposed a simple accountability measure requiring school enrollment or progress to a ged if they want to keep a texas driver license
as for white claim the candidate is right that a law required teens under to show they in school or have graduated before they can get their driver licenses and on that point perry offered nothing new
