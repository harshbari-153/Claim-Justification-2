As for recreational marijuana revenue projections, "we are seeing all those numbers reach disappointing levels in the states that have legalized. Theyâ€™re not meeting their targets for the most part."
to say that states aren t meeting their revenue targets for the most part doesn t give a clear picture of what s happening with legalized marijuana in the states
fahy said states that have legalized recreational marijuana are not meeting their targets for the most part
we are seeing all those numbers reach disappointing levels in the states that have legalized
he pointed us to california where the state collected less than it anticipated in the first full year of marijuana sales after a rocky rollout
fahy claim about marijuana revenue is wrong
