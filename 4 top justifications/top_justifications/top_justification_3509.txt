"Within two years, there were two 500-year (storm) events" in Wisconsin.
wisconsin has seen more than two storm events within the last several years
baldwin claimed that since she took office two storm events occurred in northern wisconsin
but storms in cashton and madison in lso rose to the same level meaning that there have been more than two such storms within two years in the state
within two years there were two events she said
for instance just because there were inches of rain in one day in one year doesn t mean that wisconsin won t see inches of rain in one day again for another years
