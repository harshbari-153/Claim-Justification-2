Kamala Harris is planning to use the 25th Amendment against Joe Biden and appoint Mike Pence as her vice president.
soon after trump tweeted without evidence that pelosi was looking at the amendment in order to replace joe biden with kamala harris
it s especially unfathomable that harris a democrat would nominate pence a republican as her vice president if she replaced biden
the claim that harris plans to oust biden and appoint pence as her vice president is false
i heard a rumor kamalaharris is planning on pulling the amendment on joebiden the minute he is sworn in and then appointing mikepence as her read one facebook post
now that the amendment is in the news again biden and harris have not commented on calls to use it to remove trump
