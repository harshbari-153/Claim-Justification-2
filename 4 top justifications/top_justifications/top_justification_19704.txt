Says Chuck Hagel "opposed sanctions against Iran."
ileana said defense secretary nominee chuck hagel opposed sanctions against iran
hagel s stance on sanctions against iran has sparked much discussion in recent weeks so we wanted to check s statement that hagel opposed sanctions against iran
our ruling said that hagel opposed sanctions against iran which has brazenly pursued the development of a nuclear weapon in open defiance of the international community as well as called for the destruction of one of our vital allies israel
when said hagel opposed sanctions against iran she oversimplified his lengthy history of votes and comments
in which she said hagel supported legislation that would have provided a lifeline to fidel castro opposed sanctions on iran and criticized israel
