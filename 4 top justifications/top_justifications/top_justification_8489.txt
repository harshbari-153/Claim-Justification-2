Photos of monkeypox lesions prove the current virus outbreak is a hoax.
people sharing photos of lesions caused by monkeypox and suggesting that because these images have been used in news coverage over the years that proves the current outbreak of the virus is a sham
no these photos don t prove monkeypox is a hoax
since may there have been reports of cases of monkeypox in countries where the virus is not normally found including the united states according to the world health organization
nevertheless like the other photos in this post its repeated use over time does not undermine the fact that there are real outbreaks of monkeypox happening across the world
it was provided by the centers for disease control and prevention and shows the hand of one of the first known cases of the monkeypox virus in the united states in june
