"Food waste is the 3rd largest contributor" of greenhouse gas emissions.
the world food program tweeted that food waste is the third largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions
food waste is the largest contributor of ghgs greenhouse gases to our climate the organization tweeted feb
no food waste is not the third biggest source of greenhouse gases
that is based on a comparison to the emissions of other countries but food waste is an activity not a place
so while the comparison to countries helps to establish the scale labeling food loss and waste as the world third largest emitter is missing necessary context
