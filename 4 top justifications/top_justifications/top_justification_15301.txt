Barack Obama "extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected."
if obama had said he had helped extend health care for wounded veterans who been neglected we would have given him a better rating
for his statement that he extended health care for wounded troops who been neglected the campaign points to a couple of pieces of legislation
the other piece of legislation the campaign points to is an amendment obama passed that picked up the tab for meals and phone calls for iraq veterans receiving outpatient treatment
obama closed a loophole for outpatient veterans hospitalized veterans were already covered
later in the ad obama says i passed laws moving people from welfare to work cut taxes for working families and extended health care for wounded troops who been neglected
