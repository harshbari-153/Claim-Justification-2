"Weâ€™ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week."
we ve introduced a bill that includes billion in cuts over the next week and funds our troops through the year
at issue is this line we ve introduced a bill that includes billion in cuts over the next week
boehner s statement we ve introduced a bill that includes billion in cuts over the next week and funds our troops through the year is carefully worded
indeed while the bill does include billion in cuts it also includes
but we also think boehner s artful wording suggests a much larger cut than the bill actually delivers when the additional defense spending is included
