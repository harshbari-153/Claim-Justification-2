The Rev. Rick Warren "has called Christians who advance a social gospel Marxists."
here we look at the claim that warren has called christians who advance a social gospel marxists
and he has called christians who advance a social gospel marxists
to put warren comment in the present tense saying warren has called christians who advance a social gospel marxists is a serious distortion of his comment
group says warren called some christians marxist
warren did liken the social agenda of some early century protestant theologians to marxism in christian clothing
