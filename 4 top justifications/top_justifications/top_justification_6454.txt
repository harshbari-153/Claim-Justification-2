Says a "Local Hero" was "arrested after killing 30 pedophiles in murder spree"
the screenshot shows one photo of a body bag and another of a man in the backseat of a police cruiser with the headline local hero arrested after killing pedophiles in murder spree
no that story about a nebraska man being arrested after killing pedophiles is fake
and we searched the internet and news archives but didn t find any credible reports of a man in nebraska admitting to killing pedophiles or registered sex offenders
a recently shared facebook post resurfaces a story about a man who was supposedly arrested for killing pedophiles over years
the story goes that a man named joel miller was arrested for assault and attempted murder in omaha
