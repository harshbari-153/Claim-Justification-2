Gov. Lincoln Chafee has imposed "a mandatory abortion fee" on all Rhode Islanders who buy health insurance through the stateâ€™s Obamacare exchange.
rhode island right to life executive director barth bracy said governor chafee has imposed a mandatory abortion fee on all rhode islanders who buy health insurance under obamacare
activist barth bracy says people who buy health insurance on the rhode island obamacare exchange must pay gov chafee mandatory abortion fee
it s a federal requirement although chafee who created the insurance exchange system in rhode island could have pushed for a plan that didn t cover abortion which would have allowed antiabortion consumers to have a choice on the issue
news release that because no plans on the exchange exclude abortion coverage all customers must pay a fee for such coverage and governor lincoln chafee is responsible
chafee created rhode island s health insurance exchange in september through an executive order after an effort to do so through legislation stalled in the general assembly over abortion language
