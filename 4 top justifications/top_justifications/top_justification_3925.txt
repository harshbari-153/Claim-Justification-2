Stimulus money went to "office upgrades for politicians."
then with no small hint of sarcasm the ad says stimulus money went to critically important projects such as office upgrades for politicians
our ruling the crossroads ad says that million in stimulus money went to office upgrades for politicians a reference to the latest phase in renovating the kansas state capitol building
nothing suggests a boondoggle like tens of millions of federal dollars spent on office upgrades for politicians
crossroads grassroots policy strategy claims million of stimulus money paid for renovations of politicians offices
but that doesn t mean as the ad implies that million of federal stimulus money was spent directly on the project
