Says Attorney General William Barr tweeted that the US "gave Iran USA taxpayer dollars" so Iran could purchase uranium from Russia.
no barr didn t tweet that the us gave iran taxpayer dollars so iran could buy uranium from russia
a us president gave iran usa taxpayer dollars so iran could purchase usa uranium from russia who just got of our uranium for free
attorney general william barr did not really tweet about iran using american tax dollars to buy uranium from russia
so iran used usa cash to purchase usa uranium in order to destroy usa assets all made possible by the us this is beyond treason
that s the money the united states gave iran it wasn t tax dollars
