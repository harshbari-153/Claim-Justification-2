Republican state lawmakers "are refusing to give the people of their own states their own tax dollars back in the form of (expanded) Medicaid."
we wanted to explore hartmann s argument that republican state lawmakers have refused to give the people of their own states their own tax dollars back in the form of expanded medicaid
hartmann said that by rejecting an expansion to medicaid republican state lawmakers are not allowing their residents to get their own tax dollars back
and what s worse is the people who live in states that aren t accepting the medicaid expansion will still have the pay the taxes to foot the bill for the expansion in other states
when rick perry says to the people of texas that he s not going to accept money from the federal government to pay for the expansion of medicaid what he s really saying to his own people the people of texas naw you can t have your own tax dollars back hartmann said
so experts agree that in the first three years hartmann is right people in states that refuse to expand medicaid will lose their share of tax dollars
