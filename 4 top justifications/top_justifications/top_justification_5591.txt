The stimulus bill includes "$300,000 for a sculpture garden in Miami."
here how spokesman neil bradley explained it the house stimulus bill includes million for the national endowment for the arts
does the stimulus package really include for a sculpture garden
as part of their attack on the billion economic stimulus package some republicans have attempted to discredit the plan by singling out examples of what they consider the most outrageous spending
but do a word search on sculpture in the stimulus bill now before the house and you come up blank
it is not in the proposed billion stimulus package that is being pushed by president obama and congressional democrats
