"We paid down the debt for four years -- paid down $600 billion on the national debt."
paid down the debt for four years paid down billion on the national debt
so using this measurement clinton is correct that we paid down the debt for four years though he did overestimate the amount that was paid down when he said it was billion
bill clinton says his administration paid down the debt
if the public debt during those years was bought with other debt meaning by the social security trust and the federal reserve we did actually pay down any debt did we if you take out an equity line of credit on your home to pay off your car loan your debt did decrease
in fact the federal government paid off more of its old debt than it issued new debt to the public
