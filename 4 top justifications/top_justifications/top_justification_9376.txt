Photo that shows COVID-19 test swabs labeled positive and negative proves that the tests are fixed.
an instagram post suggests that tests are fixed because a photo shows two packages of antigen testing kits with the labels positive control swab and negative control swab
positive and negative control swabs are routinely included in testing kits for quality control to ensure that the test is working correctly not for patient testing
labeled swabs in photo are for quality control not a sign tests are fixed
the latest claim comes in the form of a photo circulating on instagram which appears to show two packages of antigen test swabs with one labeled as a positive control swab and the other a negative control swab
it s perfectly normal to have pcr tests that are labelled positive and negative there s no conspiracy involved at all they aren t trying to manipulate and control the test results in any way trust your leaders
