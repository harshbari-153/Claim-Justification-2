Obama's wife wrote a paper in college that said America was a nation founded on "crime and hatred" and that whites in America are "ineradicably racist."
but the thesis did not say that the united states was founded on crime and hatred and that whites in america are ineradicably racist
it true that obama then michelle robinson attended princeton and wrote a thesis titled blacks and the black community
the words crime and hatred and ineradicably racist are inventions of whoever penned the not words that appeared in obama thesis
obama was especially interested in the attitudes of princeton alumni in regard to improving the lives of blacks
a chain about michelle obama purports to be excerpts from a senior thesis she wrote while at princeton university
