"Scott Walker has given a $10,000 tax deduction to millionaires who send their kids to exclusive private schools."
what s really troubling is that scott walker has given a tax deduction to millionaires who send their kids to exclusive private schools
the state said walker has given a tax deduction to millionaires who send their kids to exclusive private schools
some have asked why walker is giving a tax break to millionaires who can afford tuition costs rather than investing in the children who are being educated in public schools
scott walker gave private school tax break to millionaires says
but so do taxpayers of other income levels who send their kids to private schools
