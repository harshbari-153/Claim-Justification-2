"Since 1981, reconciliation has been used 21 times. Most of it's been used by Republicans."
but reid said reconciliation has been used times since and that most of the time it been republicans who have initiated it
similarly we set aside the hypocrisy of republicans who used reconciliation in the past but now denounce it
the issue we looking at here is whether republicans have really used reconciliation bills more than democrats as reid claimed
it has been used a lot and more by republicans than democrats
but remember since reconciliation has been used times
