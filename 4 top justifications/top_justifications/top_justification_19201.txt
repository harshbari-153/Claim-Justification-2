Says Anthony Fauci "is married to Ghislaine Maxwellâ€™s sister."
fauci is married to ghislaine maxwell s sister reads the description of a photo of fauci and his wife christine grady that is being shared on facebook
no fauci isn t married to ghislaine maxwell s sister
maxwell s parents were robert maxwell a british publishing giant and elisabeth maxwell who was born in france and established a scholarly journal called holocaust and genocide studies
with the recent arrest of ghislaine maxwell who was charged in connection with the sexual abuse case against the late disgraced financier jeffrey epstein we find another unsubstantiated attack against fauci
the photo is from when fauci and grady attended a state dinner at the white house
