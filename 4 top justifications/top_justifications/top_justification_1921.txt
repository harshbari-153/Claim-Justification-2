Says none of the government programs targeted for elimination or severe cutback in House Republican spending plans "appeared on the GAO's list of government programs at high risk of waste, fraud and abuse."
to my knowledge none of these existing programs appeared on the gao list of government programs at high risk of waste fraud and abuse
some of those amendments he said would eliminate funding for research and for programs needed to address pressing social and economic issues
meanwhile he noted several department of defense initiatives that ranked prominently in the gao report as programs that remain very susceptible to fraud and abuse remained untouched
in the debate over the continuing resolution that would keep the government up and running the house had supported amendments that would severely cut or entirely eliminate entities or programs which provide critical assistance to the most vulnerable americans
some of them could have direct impact on the budget he said but it not just a matter of we fix it the appropropriation will decrease
