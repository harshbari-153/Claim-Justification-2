"The president and vice president can't be from the same state."
can the president and the vice president be from the same state
but the one person who can t choose him is jeb bush because the president and vice president ca be from the same state
others note that the vice president is not a senator which is the process spelled out in the twelfth amendment
o donnell said the president and vice president ca be from the same state
while we still waiting for bush to make his candidacy official claim that the president and vice president ca be from the same state got our heads spinning
