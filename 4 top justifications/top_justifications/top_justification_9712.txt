"There is no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from COVID."
melissa melendez recently claimed there is no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from covid
there is no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from covid republican state sen
but they don t specifically support melendez s broad claim there is no science or data to suggest that kids are at risk from covid
are there really no studies showing a risk to children
but to take that and say that kids are not at risk is an oversimplification and untrue
