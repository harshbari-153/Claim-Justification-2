Says David Dewhurst accused Cruz of being a Red Chinese Communist.
ted cruz says david dewhurst camp called him a chinese communist
per our review neither dewhurst email explicitly says cruz is a chinese communist
then again we wondered if it s reasonable to read the red ted subject line of one of them as anything but a claim that cruz aligns with or even is a chinese communist
all told it s reasonable to take the subject line of one dewhurst email as calling cruz a chinese communist the other cited email similarly depicts cruz as siding with china over the united states but doesn t include the red label
in a memo directed at dewhurst the next day cruz s campaign consultant jason johnson said yesterday your campaign distributed two emails signed expressly by dewhurst for texas that accused ted cruz of being a red chinese communist
