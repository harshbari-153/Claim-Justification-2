The United States has "the most number of deductions available to corporations" for the corporate income tax.
we have a high corporate tax rate said beckel but we also have the most number of deductions available to corporations
beckel said the united states has the highest number of deductions available to corporations
tax code has the highest number of deductions
beckel however stuck to his guns repeating that the united states has the highest number of deductions and adding that companies leave the united states for cheap labor not to evade taxes
counting and comparing deductions internationally isn t practical and the only plausible alternative estimating the gap between the nations statutory and effective tax rates shows that the gap in the united states is about average among advanced industrialized countries
