Says Iran has "violated the terms of the (nuclear) deal."
handel said iran has violated the terms of the nuclear deal
these breaches formed the core basis of handel s claim that iran violated the nuclear deal

because iranian compliance is a crucial national security issue we decided to look closer at handel s repeated claims that the islamic republic had violated the terms of the deal
the iaea the foremost authority on the matter has repeatedly deemed iran in compliance with the nuclear deal
