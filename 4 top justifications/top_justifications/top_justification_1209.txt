Says the Republican "state convention is actually larger than the Republican National Convention."
it may be hard to believe dewhurst said but our republican state convention is actually larger than the republican national convention
dewhurst says believe it or not republican state convention bigger than quadrennial national convention
so how does dewhurst s statement shake out this month s gop state convention drew more delegates than the national convention but economic and other indicators suggest the national convention ultimately draws more people
com and cnn web posts both stating there were delegates to the party s national convention
next he noted a recent dallas morning news article stating gop activists went to the state convention and a fort worth article stating more than delegates and alternates were expected
