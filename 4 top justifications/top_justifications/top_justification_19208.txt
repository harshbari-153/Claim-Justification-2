"Hillary stood up for universal health care when almost no one else would, and kept standing till 6-million kids had coverage."
hillary stood up for universal health care when almost no one else would the announcer says and kept standing till kids had coverage
but did she stand up for universal health care when almost no one else did that a stretch
hillary clinton portrays herself as a leader on health care
critics of the clinton health plan mostly republicans focused on her role and mocked the proposal as hillary care
we find that the ad overstates her role on this count and also on the broader issue of universal health care
