"The Railroad Commission of Texas has nothing to do with railroads."
the railroad commission of texas has nothing to do with railroads
mcallen said the railroad commission has nothing to do with railroads
roman mcallen correct that texas railroad commission has nothing to do with railroads
still was mcallen right that the commission steered by three elected members each one having a term has nothing to do with railroads
the commission says so on a web page titled who regulates railroads in texas that page says the commission no longer has any jurisdiction or authority over railroads
