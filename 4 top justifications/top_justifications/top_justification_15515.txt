Says that Romney touted the Massachusetts health plan for the nation in his hardcover book but then deleted it for the paperback edition.
we wondered had romney really touted health care for all then deleted it we got copies of the paperback and hardcover editions
but a closer look at romney original hardcover shows perry was distorting what romney wrote when he told the former massachusetts governor between books your hard copy book you said it was exactly what the american people needed to have that romneycare given to them as you had in massachusetts
our ruling perry right that romney comments about health care were edited between editions
fox debate in orlando perry struck back by suggesting that romney had altered the paperback edition of his book no apology to downplay his support of the massachusetts health care plan
he also changed this line which came after a paragraph touting the success of the massachusetts health plan hardcover we can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country and it can be done without letting government take over health care
