Mitt Romney has "a pro-choice record."
the ad could do a better job at pointing out that romney no longer stands by his record but it does want to
politifact looked at romney abortion record previously check out that story here
the whole point is to shine a light on where romney once stood on abortion
is his record but not his position
his record on abortion is not entirely given his current position opposing abortion rights
