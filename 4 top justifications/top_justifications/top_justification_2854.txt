"I can say that the people that have been hired (for the independent Russia investigation) are all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton."
i can say that the people that have been hired are all hillary clinton supporters some of them worked for hillary clinton he said of the special counsel staffers
trump said that members of mueller s team are all hillary clinton supporters some of them worked for hillary clinton
three of the eight available mueller hires made campaign contributions to clinton which undermines trump s statement that all are clinton supporters
we found that of the eight three have made campaign contributions to hillary clinton none have worked for her and one has defended the clinton foundation in court for wilmerhale the law firm where mueller was a partner while another represented a clinton aide also for wilmerhale
she contributed to hillary for america in and to the obama victory fund in
