A video taken from a car driving through Bucha, Ukraine, shows a corpse "moving his arm," and then "in the rear view mirror the ‘corpse’ sits down."
the russian ministry of defense said a video taken from a car driving through bucha ukraine shows a corpse moving his arm and then in the rear view mirror the corpse sits down
the video shows a mark floating across the car s windshield perhaps a drop of water or a speck of dirt which russia officials falsely portrayed as of a corpse moving his arm
the expreso tv video does not show a corpse sitting up in the car s mirror either
similarly what russian officials falsely claimed was a corpse sitting up was actually a dead person whose body appeared distorted due to the shape of the car s mirror
across telegram twitter and other platforms russian officials pushing that claim shared a video showing footage taken from a car as it steered through a street strewn with bodies
