"One of the reasons that Budweiser stayed in New Jersey is the money they got from RGGI to put solar on their roof to save on their energy costs."
in response to testimony that rggi known as reggie was one of the reasons businesses were leaving the state tittel said when we talk about businesses and i know this from first hand one of the reasons that budweiser stayed in new jersey is the money they got from rggi to put solar on their roof to save on their energy costs
tittel claimed one of the reasons s budweiser brewery in newark stayed in new jersey is because they received funding through rggi to install solar panels thereby reducing their energy costs
beer company had ever considered abandoning its throne in the garden state and if a reduction in energy costs from solar panels funded by rggi was one of the reasons that convinced them to stay
the only thing tittel got correct in his statement is that solar panels were installed on the roof of s newark brewery
so the brewery had solar panels installed on its roof but did the beer company receive rggi funds for the project tittel said his statement was based on a conversation he had with al komjathy a lobbyist with the firm komjathy stewart which represents among other companies
