Virginiaâ€™s banning of felons from voting is a "Jim Crow-era law."
stoney said virginia s banning of felons from voting is a jim law
we wondered whether virginia s policy of banning felons from the ballot box really does spring from the jim crow era
it should be pointed out that virginia s current constitution adopted in after the jim crow era ended retained the ban on felon voting unless their rights had been restored by the governor
a final note this simply examines whether the felon ban is a jim crow policy
levar stoney wrongly traces virginia felon voting ban to jim crow era
