"The people who were running the budget, in the Corzine years, decided to steal from the unemployment trust fund. … As did other Governors before. We simply don’t do that, haven’t done it, and won’t permit it."
the people who were running the budget in the corzine years decided to steal from the unemployment trust fund

although christie was speaking colloquially about stealing from the fund he was wrong when he pegged diversions to the corzine administration
