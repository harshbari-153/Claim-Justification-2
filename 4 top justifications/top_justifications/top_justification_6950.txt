"As a state senator, he (Obama) even refused to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship!"
one of the claims in the article written by tom minnery senior vice president of focus on the family action is that as a state senator he obama even refused to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship
but in minnery article which has been widely circulated through chain he states that obama refused to support a bill that would have prohibited sex shops near schools and places of worship
any implication that obama vote means that he supports sex businesses opening near schools or places of worship would be false
instead of the weaker obama refused to support
but obama did actually vote no
