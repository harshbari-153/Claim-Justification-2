as evidence that this large government body had made charging this tax a top priority this year coney shared a draft of the legislative agenda for the city of portland
the group also plants a bug of fear in tax haters with this politicians have considered the idea of charging or allowing multiple layers of transfer taxes each and every legislative session for the last decade and in fact one of the state s largest governments made charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year
