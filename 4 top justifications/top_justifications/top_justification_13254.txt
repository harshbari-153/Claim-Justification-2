"Itâ€™s going to be harder to vote in Virginia than it is now to buy a gun..."
what s really ironic with what s happening is it s going to be harder to vote in virginia than it is to buy a gun with what they re doing on gun control issues she said
our ruling howell said it is becoming harder to vote in virginia than buy a gun
is it really becoming easier to buy a gun than cast a ballot in virginia howell told us her statement was a rhetorical slur
but this provision does not necessarily make voting tougher than buying a gun
you have to be a state resident to vote in virginia
