"What (the Obama administration is) going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants."
capito said what obama is going to come out with in the next several months is you not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants
but what he going to come out with in the next several months is you not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants
so how does the epa proposal say you not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants we asked capito s campaign for evidence
the proposal does not say that existing coal plants must be shut down or can t burn coal
is president barack obama poised to stop any more coal from burning in the united states
