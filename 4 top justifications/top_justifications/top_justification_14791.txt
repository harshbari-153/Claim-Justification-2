two elections in a row she has screwed up counting the vote
democratic party of wisconsin chairman mike tate says waukesha county clerk kathy nickolaus has screwed up counting the vote in two consecutive elections
in claiming nickolaus screwed up counting the vote for the second election in a row tate offered no proof that the numbers that eventually came in were off

what about tate s contention of a second time nickolaus messed up a vote count nickolaus admitted a mistake in the supreme court race but investigators found no
