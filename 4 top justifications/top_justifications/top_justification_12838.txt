People "can't go fishing anymore because of Obama."
rush limbaugh says because of obama people ca go fishing anymore
now obama apparently wants to ban a popular american pastime fishing
obama will no longer listen to the public as he tries to prohibit u
an opinion piece that argued obama effort could ban some fishing was chopped up reprocessed and put back together as a claim that obama wants to ban all fishing
we should point out that obama has not banned fishing through executive order so beck is wrong on that point
