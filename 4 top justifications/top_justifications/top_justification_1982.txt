Abortion services are "well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does."
jon kyl says abortion services are well over percent of what planned parenthood does
if you want an abortion you go to planned parenthood and that s well over percent of what planned parenthood does
the statistics from planned parenthood and the statement from kyl office make it clear that he erred by saying abortion counts for well over percent of the group services
planned parenthood says the statistics are dramatically different that percent of its services are preventive in nature compared with percent that are
so planned parenthood s use of services as its yardstick likely decreases abortion s prominence compared to what other measurements would show
