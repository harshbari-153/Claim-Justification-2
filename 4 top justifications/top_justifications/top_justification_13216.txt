Says a quote defending President Donald Trump can be attributed to Clint Eastwood.
a viral facebook post wrongly attributed a defense of president donald trump to actor clint eastwood
state lawmaker s letter wrongly attributed to clint eastwood
that post included a meme that showed a photo of eastwood and quoted him as saying if congress really gave a rat s ass about the american people they would resign
the confusion linking eastwood to the letter likely came after the massachusetts republican party reposted doucette s writing to its facebook page in november
for what it s worth we checked google and nexis and could not verify that eastwood ever made that statement about congress either
