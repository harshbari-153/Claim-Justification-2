"Pennsylvania (is) the only state in the country not to tax drillers."
he wrong about pennsylvania being the only state without a severance tax though it the only major state without one
while pennsylvania remains the largest natural state without a severance tax according to the national conference of state legislatures it is not the only state without one
in the same breath wolf says this lobbying blitz has left pennsylvania the only state in the country not to tax drillers
wolf is accurate in saying pennsylvania does not have a severance tax on drilling
sheridan continued it s long past time pennsylvania is the only major gas producing state that does not impose a severance tax on oil and gas
