Kathryn Starkey "only attended half of those meetings."
kathryn starkey missed just over half the meetings
she only attended half of those meetings pennington said he based that claim on minutes from the basin board s meetings
starkey served on the board from june through april so we looked only at the meetings that fell within that period
of budget meetings she could have attended starkey attended seven five of those seven were the final votes
that attendance record is more than half by a hair
