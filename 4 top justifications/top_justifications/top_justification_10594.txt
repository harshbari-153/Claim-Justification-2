The Associated Press called Charlie Crist's attacks "over the top," "out of context," and "not true."
the ads claim that the article labeled crist attacks over the top out of context and not true
many of crist attacks are exaggerated take words out of context are true or over the top
the ads say crist attacks are false
it worth noting that crist new tv ad references only two of the six attacks farrington focused on in the ap article about spending of gop political donations and that rubio was a lobbyist and it unclear from the article how farrington would describe those specific attacks
in two short television ads rubio tries to soften crist attacks with the help of the respected and impartial associated press
