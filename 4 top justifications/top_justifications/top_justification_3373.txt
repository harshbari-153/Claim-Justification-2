"In 2006, I went out and authored a letter with 24 other senators asking for major reform of Freddie and Fannie, warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market."
in i went out and authored a letter with other senators asking for major reform of freddie and fannie warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market the former pennsylvania senator he said
santorum said he went out and authored a letter with other senators asking for major reform of freddie and fannie warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market
debate fannie and freddie came up in a question contributed by the public
the letter in other words warned of the risk fannie and freddie might pose to the financial system if they could cover their obligations
it seems they both acknowledge they both made money from fannie and freddie he said should they return that money santorum said well i would just say in answer to the question that as i mentioned last debate in i went out and authored a letter with other senators asking for major reform of freddie and fannie warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market
