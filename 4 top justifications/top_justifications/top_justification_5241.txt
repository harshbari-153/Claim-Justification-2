"We're spending $1.6 billion for all of Latin America in terms of aid and assistance, a
fraction of what we're spending in Iraq, the $500 billion we've spent there"
dodd assertion that foreign aid spending on latin america stands at
his overall point that spending on aid to latin america is only a small fraction of iraq spending is very much on targetspending in iraq has already passed the half trillion dollar mark is slightly exaggerated but that a quibble
the claim that the united states has spent billion in iraq is not entirely accurate but it too is pretty darn close
estimates vary on the precise amount spent since the invasion but two of the most credible sources the congressional research service and the congressional budget office give the total as approximately billion and billion respectively
