Build Back Better "would be a huge payday for Chinese manufacturing" and "would fill our streets with cars made with Chinese parts."
the stand up to china group claimed that the build back better legislation would be a huge payday for chinese manufacturing and would fill our streets with cars made with chinese parts
taken together the ads claimed that the legislation would be a huge payday for chinese manufacturing and would fill our streets with cars made with chinese parts
any benefits for china from build back better would hardly be noticeable in comparison
saying that the bill would be a huge payday for chinese manufacturing is a wild exaggeration said derek scissors an expert on the chinese economy at the american enterprise institute
no evidence that the build back better bill would be financial boon to chinese companies
