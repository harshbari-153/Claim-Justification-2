Bernie Sandersâ€™s plan is "to raise your taxes to 90 percent."
christie said that sanders s plan is to raise your taxes to percent
chris christie says bernie sanders s plan is raise your taxes to percent
christie for his part said sanders would raise your taxes to percent
there s no doubt that sanders wants to raise taxes on the richest percent
beyond this there s some doubt that sanders could achieve his policy proposals without additional tax increases
