i delivered on my campaign promise for a tax cut for wisconsin families he said jan
evers said he delivered on his promise of a tax cut for wisconsin families
we focused on married filers since evers speech referred to families but we should note he also promised a tax cut to everyone filing an individual tax return with an income of or less
in july we rated a promise to cut middle class taxes by as a compromise since initial projections showed evers proposed tax break was cut roughly in half by the republican legislature
evers speech didn t go into much detail on the nature of that tax cut but he was quite specific in on the campaign trail
