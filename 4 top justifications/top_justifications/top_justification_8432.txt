"Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan."
barack obama never held a single senate hearing on afghanistan an announcer states
obama did not hold hearings that dealt directly with afghanistan
he held not one substantive hearing to do oversight to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with nato in afghanistan
mccain ad though does make the detailed case that clinton did as to why obama should have held hearings on afghanistan in the first place
during the hearing obama talked in some depth about nato and afghanistan
