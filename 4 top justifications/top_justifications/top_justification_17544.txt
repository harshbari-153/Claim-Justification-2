Calls COVID-19 vaccine a "non-FDA-approved experimental agent."
an instagram post described the vaccine as a experimental agent
while vaccine skeptics often use the term experimental agent when referring to the vaccines the fda refers to the drugs as investigational vaccines
here we check the claim that any of the vaccines rely on a experimental agent
while the vaccines await full fda approval the fda formally authorized their use after reviewing months of data involving tens of thousands of clinical trial participants
the fda issued emergency use authorizations for the pfizer moderna and johnson and johnson vaccines
