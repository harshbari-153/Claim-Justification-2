"Our debt is already bigger than our economy."
our debt is already bigger than our economy he said at cpac on march
our ruling ryan claimed that our debt is already bigger than our economy
paul ryan says nation s debt is bigger than the economy
so if we just consider debt held by the public which is what most affects the economy it totals about percent of gdp not as ryan said more than the size of the economy
if your problem with the national debt is that you think it s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public
