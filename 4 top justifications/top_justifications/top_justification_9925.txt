Says if a Florida bill (HB 697) punishing sanctuary cities becomes law "it will be the only law of its kind in the nation."
the only other state considering a bill anywhere close to florida s bill is texas which is considering a piece of legislation that would prohibit sanctuary city policies and apply some of the same penalties included in hb including withholding grant money and civil fines
this made us wonder is florida considering legislation for sanctuary cities
national experts agree that to the best of their knowledge while other states have taken up bills on sanctuary cities no other law or pending bill goes as far in terms of the breadth of the prohibitions and the penalties imposed in hb
smith said that a proposed crackdown on florida s sanctuary cities hb would be the only one of its kind in the nation
and north carolina prohibits sanctuary cities but there s no enforcement mechanism
