"70% of Americans don't believe a word the mainstream media puts out," so "everyone who thinks Biden won are only 30% of the population."
the facebook post said of americans do believe a word the mainstream media puts out so everyone who thinks biden won are only of the population
where the post s message goes off the rails is its conclusion that as a result of the distrust of the media everyone who thinks biden won are only of the population
that means everyone you re seeing and everyone who thinks biden won are only of the population
please keep in mind the post says that of americans do believe a word the mainstream media puts out except for maybe a few faces on fox news
the level of people who have a complete distrust of the media is about half as high as the post says according to the most recent gallup poll and the most recent poll asking about biden s legitimacy found support which is more than twice as high as what the post said
