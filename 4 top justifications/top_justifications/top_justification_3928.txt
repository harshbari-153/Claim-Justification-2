"More lives have been lost because of the war with the drug cartels in Juarez alone, just a few blocks from the United States of America, than have been lost in the war in Afghanistan."
more lives have been lost because of the war with the drug cartels in juarez alone just a few blocks from the united states of america than have been lost in the war in afghanistan
for now we decided to focus on whether more lives have been lost in the war with drug cartels in juarez than in the war in afghanistan
that might be so but abbott flatly told van susteren that more lives have been lost in the war with drug cartels in juarez than have been lost in the war in afghanistan
he said more people have died as result of the drug war in juarez dating a couple years back than have died as a result of the war in afghanistan
over the past couple of years more than people in juarez alone have been killed because of the drug cartel war more than across the country of mexico
