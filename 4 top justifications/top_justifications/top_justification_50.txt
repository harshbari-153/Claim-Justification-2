"Whether you like to admit it or not, half our general revenue goes to education."
whether you like to admit it or not half our general revenue goes to education haridopolos was quoted as saying in the orlando sentinel
for this fact check we decided to zero in on haridopolos claim that half of state general revenue goes to fund education
divide one into the other and you see that education spending currently equals more than percent of general revenue
part of the problem is just how much of the budget is tied to education funding he said half of the state general revenue fund
but he right that the state general revenue fund which is a little more than a third of the overall state budget is being used primarily to fund education
