I differed with my party on business legislation, on consumer protection, and on free trade agreements.
we will consider bonamici s three examples on business consumer protection and free trade with this question in mind did she in fact differ with her party on matters of policy overall bonamici said she looks at policy on its merits regardless of the forces behind it
bonamici and finally during this campaign i could have taken the easy way in a primary campaign and said i wouldn t support the free trade agreements that were pending before congress
suzanne bonamici says she s different from other democrats in instances of business consumer protection and free trade
but consumer protection is an issue on which democrats have long prided themselves
and that happened in the last session when my party democratic chair didn t want to hear a bill that i thought was good for oregon business
