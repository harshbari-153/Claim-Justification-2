Says Patrick Henry said, "The Constitution is not a document for the government to restrain the people: it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government."
did patrick henry the patriot best known for saying give me liberty or give me death assert that the constitution is not a document for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government
why create a bogus quotation when henry actually said similar things about the need to restrain government kidd wrote
so whether henry said it or not is important
readers are free to embrace the message but to say henry or any other famous person said something he did is an example of fake news
in a facebook post sean suggests that there are allegations that henry never uttered those words but he dismissed them
