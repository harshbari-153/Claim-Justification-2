[Chicago is the] only city in the United States, you get a B average in high school, community college is free.
mayor emanuel said chicago is the only city in the united states you get a b average in high school community college is free
we chicago are the only city where if you get a b average in high school community college is free emanuel said
while it is true a b average means you can go to community college for free in chicago with some added requirements emanuel exaggerated his claim that chicago is the only city in the nation to offer such an incentive
chicago s star scholarship program does allow students with a b average or higher to attend community college in the city for free
when we emailed the mayor s office enquiring about these other programs we received a reply saying that chicago was the first city to leverage free community college for high school students
