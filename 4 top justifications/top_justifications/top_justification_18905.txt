The Treaty of Tripoli signed by President John Adams was "his outreach to Muslims."
president john adams of course signed the treaty of tripoli his outreach to muslims olbermann said
but to the extent that adams or the other early presidents reached out to muslims it was always for the same reason to obtain agreements shielding american ships from attacks in the mediterranean
in fact president john adams wanted to secure commercial shipping rights and the countries he wanted to negotiate with happened to be muslim and happened to justify piracy by declaring war on christian nations
i do know what olbermann meant by to muslims but adams signed the treaty to secure american commercial rights in the mediterranean
this was indisputably outreach not just to tripoli but a declaration of intentions regarding any mahometan muslim nation she said in an interview
