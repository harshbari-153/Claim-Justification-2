"And this would be the first year, if everything holds true, we will spend over $10 billion of our state budget on Medicaid out of the $28 billion budget."
rowden said this would be the first year if everything holds true we will spend over billion of our state budget on medicaid out of the billion budget
so while medicaid spending will exceed billion of the nearly billion budget not all of the money is coming directly from the state
at first glance this seems like this is the total budget for medicaid in the state
we wanted to know if this level of medicaid spending could be correct
billion of state revenue on medicaid
