Says Ron Johnson "opposes entirely a federal minimum wage," except perhaps for "guest workers."
feingold says johnson opposes entirely a federal minimum wage except perhaps for guest workers
it may not be a position johnson has stated often but when asked in july whether there should be a federal minimum wage johnson said there should not be one other than perhaps one for guest workers
and while he may not be trying to repeal the wage johnson didn t dispute the accuracy of feingold s claim that he is against having a federal minimum except perhaps for guest workers coming in from outside the united states
johnson has often spoken against raising the minimum wage
but does he oppose there being any general federal minimum wage law
