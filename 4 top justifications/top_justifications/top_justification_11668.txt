"Here in Florida, Iâ€™ve slashed government by 10 percent. That's $7 billion."
in a new radio advertisement for his campaign he says here in florida i ve slashed government by percent

so while it is true that state government has shrunk by percent since crist s election it had little to do with him and a lot to do with the shrinking economy
senate florida gov
it is because of the worst economy florida has had since the great depression
