Of the Trump administration’s European travel restrictions that exempt the U.K.: "Well, you can just get into the Chunnel, and you’ll be in the U.K."
speaking of trump s europe travel restriction exempting the united kingdom pelosi said well you can just get into the chunnel and you ll be in the u
can europeans get around trump travel ban by going to england first not so simple
people from the united kingdom who traveled to a schengen area state in the two weeks before their attempted travel to the united states would presumably be barred entry unless they qualify for the exemptions
so someone in france who traveled to england would not be immediately exempt from the restrictions
however even if someone gets from france to the united kingdom they can t get on a plane right away and come to the united states since trump s proclamation bars people who had been in schengen area two weeks before
