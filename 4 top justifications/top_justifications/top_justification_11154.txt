Russia has "tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads — 1,800, by the way — where they expanded, and we didn't."
trump said russia has tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads by the way where they expanded and we did
we decided to take a look at trump s claim that russia has nuclear warheads expanding their arsenal while the united states did not
however trump overstates the significance of this growth in russian deployed nuclear warheads and his claim omits the fact that russia and the united states are estimated to have about the same number of nuclear warheads when stockpiles are included
but that statistic ignores that russia s total number of warheads deployed and in its reserves is about the same as the united states
as of may russia has nuclear warheads deployed and in reserve and the united states has about the same at according to federation of american scientists estimates
