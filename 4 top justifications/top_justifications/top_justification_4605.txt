A Georgia law has not "criminalized giving people bottles of water." It pertains to political organizations.
holmes said a georgia law has not criminalized giving people bottles of water
we decided to holmes statement that the georgia law doesn t criminalize giving voters bottles of water
what i thought required clarification about the claim of criminalizing water is that this georgia statute was not silent on the issue
but the language in the law doesn t ban only political entities from handing out water
however during the show he misled when he said the law doesn t criminalize giving away water
