Says she got unions to agree to "about $10 million in reduction" of salaries and health benefits while serving as Dane County executive in Wisconsin.
our conclusion falk said she used collective bargaining to reduce dane county employee salaries and health benefits by about million
she used collective bargaining with unions to achieve savings on employee costs while walker and the legislature used legislation to force most state and local employees to pay more for benefits
but let s check falk s more specific claim that she reduced salaries and health benefits of dane county employees by about million
starting in after the current contract ends dane county employees will be subject to the collective bargaining legislation and will be forced to contribute to their pensions
when times got tough i sat down with eight unions and bargained about million in reduction of their salaries and health benefits by them voluntarily at the collective bargaining table agreeing to that
