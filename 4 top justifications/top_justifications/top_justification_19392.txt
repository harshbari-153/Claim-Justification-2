Says Jeff Stone = Scott Walker.
later he adds jeff stone is scott walker
i jeff stone
stone and walker s statements walker touted stone in february as a worthy successor saying he was interested in pursuing some of the same reforms and ideas that walker has backed
stone helped walker get elected
but it s worth evaluating because both sides have made stone s ties to walker a theme stone ran as walker s logical successor for most of the race and abele is now pointing that out in a negative sense
