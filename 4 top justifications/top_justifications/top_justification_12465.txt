aronberg says crist called him rock star

you notice the post version of the quote includes the qualifier almost but we listened to audio from the original miami herald interview and indeed crist unequivocally says he a rock star
we found the quote in an april post on the miami herald naked politics blog titled appropriately aronberg is crist
