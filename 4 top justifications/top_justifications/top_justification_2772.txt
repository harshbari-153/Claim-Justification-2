rick scott goes out around the country and advertises that to other states
scott spokeswoman jackie schutz said the ad wasn t scott bragging about low wages but rather him pointing out differences between the states economies
we wondered if floridians really earned so little and whether scott was so proud of low wages that he was using it as a selling point for other states
but while there s no question florida s wages are low by national standards it doesn t appear scott has boasted at least publicly about this fact while recruiting businesses from other states
he goes out around the country and advertises that to other states
