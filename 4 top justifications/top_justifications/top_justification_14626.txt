November 2012 was "a record year of turnout. More people voted before Election Day using absentee ballots and voting early than ever before in our history."
more people voted before election day using absentee ballots and voting early than ever before in our history
more people voted before election day using absentee ballots and voting early than ever before in our history
i shudder to think what things might have looked like if we actually had a record turnout percent this past election our experts also said turnout numbers shouldn t be used as an excuse for the long lines
also he right that more people than ever before voted early or absentee
in response to the state s decision to reduce early voting days the obama campaign encouraged supporters to vote with absentee ballots which are typically mailed in but can also be dropped off in person at the supervisor of elections office
