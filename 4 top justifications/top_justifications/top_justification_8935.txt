Undocumented students who qualify for in-state Oregon tuition are "actively working toward U.S. citizenship."
tuition equity supporters say undocumented students in oregon are working toward citizenship
in other words just because it s difficult for undocumented students to get legal status now which is why some in oregon want tuition equity doesn t mean they can t get legal status in the future
among the hot topics of the oregon legislature this session is senate bill which would grant cheaper tuition to undocumented students brought to the country as children
but the federal dream act is not oregon s tuition equity bill and for supporters to claim that these students are all actively working toward or on the path toward citizenship is misleading
now we at politifact oregon understand just enough about federal immigration law to know that applying for citizenship or legal residency as an undocumented person still living in the united states is really tough under current law
