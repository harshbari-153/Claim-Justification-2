"I have never asked for nor received a single earmark or pork barrel project for my state."
and i proud to tell you chris in years as a member of congress i have never asked for nor received a single earmark or pork barrel project for my state and i guarantee you i veto those spending bills
it appears he was seeking pork barrel projects for arizona which puts a few blemishes on an otherwise pure record against pork
in its simplest form pork barrel spending is a project designed to benefit a particular constituency and an earmark is the designation of funds for a specific purpose
whether these projects constitute earmarked pork depends on how you look at the issue
none of those really rise to the traditional largely accepted definition of earmarks he said
