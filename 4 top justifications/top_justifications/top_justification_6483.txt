President Obama "doesn't ... want to admit we're at war."
his remarks here go beyond opinion because he repeatedly says that obama wo acknowledge that the united states is at war
with his statement to politico cheney is going further than hannity did directly alleging that obama will not admit we at war
why doesn t he want to admit we re at war it doesn t fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the oval office
but we are at war and when president obama pretends we aren t it makes us less safe
as i ve watched the events of the last few days it is clear once again that president obama is trying to pretend we are not at war cheney said
