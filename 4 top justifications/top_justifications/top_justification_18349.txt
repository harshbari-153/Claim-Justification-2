Spicer: "Trump has the legal right to cancel SCOTUS because they serve at his pleasure"
president trump not only has the power to fire robert mueller he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the supreme court of the united states as well should he feel the need for it
the story claims spicer shared this information in a press briefing media outlets were banned from airing in which he also announced trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to the victims of a u
spicer did offer the white house s condolences to the victims and said mueller s fate was in trump s hands but he never suggested the president holds the power to disband the supreme court
com reported that white house press secretary sean spicer declared that the president holds the power to disband the u
the story manipulated spicer s quote that everyone who serves the president serves at the pleasure of the president referring to the fact that mueller s superior deputy attorney general rod rosenstein ultimately answers to the president
