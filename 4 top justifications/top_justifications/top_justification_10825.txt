"Over half of the people who would be taxed under (a millionaire surtax) are, in fact, small businesspeople."
our ruling boehner said over half of the people who would be taxed under this plan are in fact small businesspeople
and it s incorrect to call small business owners and millionaires who would see a tax increase one and the same
but half the income being taxed at that rate is not the same as half the earners being taxed at that rate
do you not feel that by opposing it you basically out of step with the american people on this issue well boehner responded over half of the people who would be taxed under this plan are in fact small businesspeople
are people who get relatively little income from business really small businessmen williams asked
