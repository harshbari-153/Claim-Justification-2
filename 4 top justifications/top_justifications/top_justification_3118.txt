"Mike Trainor...still owes $250,000 to the state."
so if the debt remains but trainor isn t obligated to repay it does he really owe the state money we called cianci and challenged him on his use of the term owes
maybe it was discharged he said but in the mind of the taxpayer who fronted the grand yeah he still owes it
that month trainor also repaid the state
cianci says chafee staffer michael trainor still owes to
so it certainly sounded then as though chafee and even trainor himself believed that trainor still owed the edc the money
