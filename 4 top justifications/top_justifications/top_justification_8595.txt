"Pathogens evolve to become less, not more, virulent over time" because otherwise, "theyâ€™d destroy their hosts which they depend on to live."
a facebook post claims that pathogens evolve to become less virulent over time because otherwise they d destroy their hosts which they depend on to live
if pathogens evolved to become more virulent with time they d destroy their hosts which they depend on to live and you wouldn t be here to read this
pathogens evolve to become less not more virulent over time says one facebook post
it has been that pathogens can evolve to be more virulent
a subsequent theory the model posits that pathogens evolve by balancing their need to propagate using host resources against the risk of doing too much harm to their hosts
