Sen. Mark Kelly voted "for benefits to illegals."
a video ad from the nrsc claimed kelly voted for benefits to illegals citing two votes related to the stimulus checks sent out during the pandemic
the ad goes on to make a number of claims including that kelly voted for benefits to illegals
mark kelly s votes did not give benefits to immigrants in the country illegally
arrighi issued a statement on kelly s vote saying senator kelly voted with republicans a few weeks ago against a provision to allow stimulus checks for illegal immigrants
we found the nrsc claim is not accurate since none of kelly s votes on the issue made it possible for immigrants who were in the country illegally to become eligible for the stimulus checks
