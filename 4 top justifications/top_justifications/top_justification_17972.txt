"We are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy."
we are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy
mitt romney says is only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy
the free market is a somewhat vague term
thus if spending is percent of gdp then we are free and if it grows to percent then we have lost percent of our freedom and are only percent free
so as measured by economists from both ends of the spectrum and most importantly from the conservative heritage foundation it ridiculously false to say we are close to losing our economy
