The U.S. has to go to "plane graveyards" and museums to get parts for its 20-year-old jet fighters while it sells new jets to other countries.
has to go to plane graveyards and museums to get parts for its jet fighters while it sells new jets to other countries
remember we re the ones with the jet fighters that are years old that we have to go to graveyards plane graveyards to get parts to use on our jet fighters to have our great young people to fly in planes where they go into junk yards and museums to get parts for current fighters while our opponents and our allies are buying our planes and they ve got the new beautiful versions of them and we ve got old planes i mean literally obsolete planes
military really scrounging for parts in junkyards and museums are our jets really decades old and do we sell newer and better planes to our allies while keeping older inferior versions for ourselves
those same companies are also selling planes to the u
sells planes more advanced than the ones they themselves are using
