"As governor of Florida I defunded Planned Parenthood."
here s my record as governor of florida i defunded planned parenthood
bush said as governor of florida i defunded planned parenthood
but we wanted to check if he cut off state assistance for planned parenthood while governor well before the current controversy
according to a state fiscal analysis bush vetoed in funding for northeast florida planned parenthood in duval county and for department of health contracts with planned parenthood in collier and sarasota counties
we must note that the money was for family planning and health care services not abortions but he did cut off state money for the group
