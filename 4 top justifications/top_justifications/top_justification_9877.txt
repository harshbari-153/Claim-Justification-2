"Thereâ€™s only one candidate under investigation -- Terry McAuliffe."
cuccinelli said mcauliffe is the only gubernatorial candidate under formal investigation
the truth there s only one candidate under investigation terry mcauliffe the announcer says at the start of a cuccinelli tv commercial that s been airing since aug
examining cuccinelli s ad claim requires a determination whether either major party candidate is under formal investigation
there is no indication mcauliffe is personally under investigation
so again there is no evidence that mcauliffe is being personally investigated
