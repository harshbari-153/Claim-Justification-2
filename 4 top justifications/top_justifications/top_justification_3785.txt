"The governor having a meeting ... isn't covered by the open meetings act."
now back to olens claim that the governor having a meeting isn t frankly subject to the open meetings act
the answer is the governor having a meeting isn t frankly subject to the open meetings act olens said
he continued the question presented from a legal context is whether the state s open meetings act precluded that activity
the most powerful elected official in the state isn t covered by state open meetings law we thought this claim was worth a second look
of all the elected officials covered by georgia s open meetings laws nathan deal isn t one of them
