with retail people are moving around and you don t have as much a chance to spread the virus as you do when people are sitting or standing indoors
cooper said shopping isn t as likely to spread coronavirus as church services because people are moving around and you don t have as much a chance to spread the virus as you do when people are sitting or standing indoors
however experts do believe that sitting in one place for a long time does pose a threat while shopping usually allows people the physical freedom to avoid someone who might be infected
we know that inside it is much more likely that you re going to transmit this virus particularly when you re sitting or standing in one place for a long period of time and this is across the board
is it also possible that one shopper could linger too long around another shopper who s infected also yes
