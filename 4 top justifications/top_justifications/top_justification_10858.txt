Lizbeth Benacquisto's supporters "would make (abortion) illegal in all cases, including rape, incest, even to save a woman's life."
therefore those who have abortions would be criminals
her allies would make choice illegal in all cases including rape incest even to save a woman life
kevin rader says extremist supporters of his opponent would make abortion illegal in all cases
but none appear to say they would support abortion regardless of whether a woman was raped abused by a family member or faced with death
and the christian coalition of florida states although legal in the united states we believe abortion is no less than murder of an innocent human life
