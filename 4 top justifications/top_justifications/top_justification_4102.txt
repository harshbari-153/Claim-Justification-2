Says Donald Trump has "bankrupted his companies not once, not twice but four times."
clinton said trump has bankrupted his companies not once not twice but four times
he bankrupted his companies not once not twice but four times
yep donald trump companies have declared bankruptcy more than four times
so clinton was right that trump bankrupted companies four times and she could have offered a higher count as well
but experts told us trump shouldn t bear all the responsibility as clinton s wording suggests as the majority of bankruptcies happened as the overall casino industry struggled
