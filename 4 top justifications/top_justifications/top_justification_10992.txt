The last time Republican U.S. Senate candidates "beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980."
spicer said the last time republican senate candidates beat more than two incumbents was
last time gop defeated two senate incumbent democrats try
since then republicans have turned two or fewer seats each election
we looked at past senate election results and found that republicans have had some successful gains in the past years but many of those wins were in races for an open seat when a democratic senator was retiring
but have republican challengers really struggled so much to take democratic seats
