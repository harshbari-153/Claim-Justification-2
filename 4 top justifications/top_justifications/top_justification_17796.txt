"The FBI just confirmed that it was ANTIFA, not Trump supporters, who breached the Capitol."
the fbi just confirmed that it was antifa not trump supporters who breached the capital the post said misspelling capitol
no the fbi didn t confirm antifa activists breached the capitol
it mentioned neither antifa nor the president s supporters but said the fbi is seeking information that will assist in identifying individuals who are actively instigating violence in washington d
but no one claiming that antifa activists stormed the capitol has provided legitimate proof while the evidence that trump supporters were involved is indisputable
and the evidence that some people have pointed to reports that a facial recognition firm confirmed that antifa infiltrated the trump rally is inaccurate
