Says federal law enforcement officers cut off questioning of the Christmas Day underwear bomber by giving him a Miranda warning after 30 minutes of questioning.
the court ruled that law enforcement officers may ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety before they administer a miranda warning to a suspect in custody
giuliani says only questioned underwear bomber for minutes before reading miranda rights
we steer clear of the question of whether it smart to offer miranda warnings to terrorist suspects because that an opinion
what is less certain and relevant to giuliani larger point is whether federal officials read abdulmutallab the miranda warning before it was clear that he would stop cooperating or whether they mirandized him only because he already had ceased to cooperate
it worth noting that earlier in the conversation giuliani offered a similar but slightly different characterization of abdulmutallab questioning saying to cut it off after or minutes like they did in detroit on christmas day
