Says Steve Jobs said, "I realize that all my recognition and wealth that I have is meaningless in the face of imminent death."
at this moment lying on the bed sick and remembering all my life i realize that all my recognition and wealth that i have is meaningless in the face of imminent death jobs said in his last days according to a jan
no steve jobs didn t say this about wealth as he was dying
like jobs he didn t make this statement
in apple steve jobs died as a result of complications from pancreatic cancer
it didn t come up in his obituary in the new york times or in walter isaacon s jobs biography or in the eulogy given by his sister mona simpson who said that jobs last words were spoken after he looked at members of his family oh wow
