Marco Rubio says "Solo Ingles" (English only).
the image has a word bubble coming from rubio mouth that says solo ingles which means english only
the claim got our attention because rubio is a child of cuban immigrants who speaks both spanish and english fluently
there no doubt rubio supports english as the official language of the united states
rubio also has been airing an ad for his senate campaign in spanish
instead rubio supports making english the official language of the united states but says he would want to ban other languages
