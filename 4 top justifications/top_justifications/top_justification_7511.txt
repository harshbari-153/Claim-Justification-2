"Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency (Zika)."
naral s tv ad said marco rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency zika
but marco rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency states the narrator while text states that rubio voted against contraception and family planning
the ad creates a misleading impression that rubio s votes show he is indifferent to funding clinics to combat zika
the ad is referring to rubio s votes in favor of zika legislation that would have cut funding to one organization in puerto rico an affiliate of planned parenthood
shame on washington for failing to pass zika funding rubio said after the bill died
