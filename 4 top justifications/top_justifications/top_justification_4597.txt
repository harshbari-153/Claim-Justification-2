"We're also cutting a Forest Service economic development program that strayed so far from any mission that it funded a music festival."
we also cutting a forest service economic development program that strayed so far from any mission that it funded a music festival
we briefly touch on the first example later but we want to focus on that second one the proposal to eliminate the million budget for a forest service economic development program that strayed so far from any mission that it funded a music festival
obama proposed to ax budget of forest service program that veered so far astray it funded a music festival
and maybe the forest service eap program is not targeted or duplicative as obama budget documents suggest but it misleading for obama to employ a machine to discredit a million forest service program by citing a grant awarded for a music festival in during the clinton administration
it lists several examples including the music festival and adds that the program is also duplicative of other usda programs that can address priority needs in rural areas and assist industries
