Says Mitt Romney "runs away from Ronald Reagan."
newt gingrich ad says mitt romney away from ronald reagan
but we have a different problem with the gingrich ad it erred by using the present tense in the saying that mitt romney runs away from ronald reagan
to us that means that romney is still distancing himself from reagan
in this case though we don t think romney s discomfort with policies justifies the gingrich ad s claim that romney is a massachusetts moderate who runs away from ronald reagan
that failing reagan romney said essentially holding up reagan as the standard to which republicans should aspire
