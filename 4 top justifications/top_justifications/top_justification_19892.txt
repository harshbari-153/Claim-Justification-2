Says Mitt Romney "put Planned Parenthood on a state medical board but failed to put a pro-life group on the same board."
gingrich ad says mitt romney appointed planned parenthood to a medical board but not an group
it has nothing to do with saying what they ll cover what they won t cover in abortion services said anne fox president of massachusetts citizens for life an organization opposed to abortionwhen romney was governor he appointed deborah enos president of neighborhood health plan a medicaid managed care organization and bob moran an expert in payment methodologies at the university of massachusetts
the problem with the gingrich ad claim however is that the board s job is to review state medicaid reimbursement rates it does not address abortion policy at all
the governor of massachusetts gets to appoint two of the board members
