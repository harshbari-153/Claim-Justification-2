Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson "doesn't even believe that there's a man-made role in climate change."
johnson did not support a senate amendment to acknowledge a role in climate change and expressed skepticism each of the few times he acknowledged humans might contribute
russ feingold says ron johnson does believe a role in climate change
we wondered whether feingold is right that johnson has denied a human role in climate change
when johnson and feingold first ran against each other in johnson definitively told the journal sentinel s editorial board his position at the time i absolutely do not believe in the science of climate change
feingold said johnson does even believe that there a role in climate change
