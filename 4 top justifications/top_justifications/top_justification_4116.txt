Bill Nelson voted to confirm Sonia Sotomayor, "who signed a Supreme Court opinion saying Americans do not have an individual right to own firearms."
for this we wanted to confirm whether nelson voted for sotomayor and if she signed an opinion that said americans do not have an individual right to own firearms
one of its points bill nelson voted to confirm barack obama nominees to the supreme court including sonia sotomayor who signed a supreme court opinion saying americans do not have an individual right to own firearms
our ruling the nra is correct in saying nelson voted to confirm sonia sotomayor as an associate justice of the supreme court
the important note to all of this of course is that nelson voted to confirm sotomayor before her vote in mcdonald
what missing from this attack is the context that nelson voted to confirm sotomayor before she signed the opinion in mcdonald
