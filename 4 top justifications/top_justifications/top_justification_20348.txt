Under the new health care law, the elderly will be denied care when they have "passed the age limit for treatment."
they denied you because you passed the age limit for the treatment
spokesman peter ashkenaz told us in an that there are no age limits for treatment under medicare
so that seems to say that even if research shows a certain treatment for the elderly is effective that ca be used to create an age limit for that treatment
steve ullmann professor and director of programs in health sector management and policy at the university of miami said there is some limitation in provisions of care of people based on age in england for certain treatments though you can buy them out of pocket outside of the national health service
but the health care bill makes cuts to medicare he said and that will lead to less care for the elderly
