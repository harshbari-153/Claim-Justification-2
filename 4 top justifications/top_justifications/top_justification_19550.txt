"This ban will only apply to Oregon commercial fishermen. Washington commercial fishermen would still be allowed to use gillnets on the Columbia River."
would a gillnetting ban mean that washington commercial fishermen could continue to use gillnets on the columbia river yes an oregon ban has no authority in waters outside oregon
would proposed ban target only oregon commercial gillnetters leave washington fishermen free to use gillnets on the columbia
in a guest column published in the oregonian she argues that the ban would allow washington fisheries to continue to use gillnets in the columbia river but not oregon fisheries
would the ban apply only to oregon commercial fishermen and not washington commercial fishermen in oregon s side of the river no state law applies equally to all
this ban will only apply to oregon commercial fishermen
