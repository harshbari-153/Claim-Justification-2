"Fewer black and Latino men participate in the labor force, compared to young white men."
obama said that fewer black and latino men participate in the labor force compared to young white men
barack obama says fewer black latino young men participate in the labor force than young white men
as obama explained the challenges facing young black and latino men today he offered this statistic fewer black and latino men participate in the labor force compared to young white men
so for americans age to obama is correct that labor force participation among black and hispanic men trails that of white men
in addition we assumed that obama was comparing youth labor force participation for black and latino men to the rate for white youth even though he didn t explicitly say that
