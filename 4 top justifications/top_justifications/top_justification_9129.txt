"There is a growing body of evidence that radiation in excess of what the government says are the minimum amounts you should be exposed to are actually good for you and reduce cases of cancer."
there is a growing body of evidence that radiation in excess of what the government says are the minimum amounts you should be exposed to are actually good for you and reduce cases of cancer coulter said
we rating whether coulter was correct in saying there is a growing body of evidence that radiation in excess of approved exposure levels may be beneficial
so where does this leave us we are not rating whether hormesis or as coulter put it the theory that exposure to low levels of radiation is actually good for you and reduces cases of cancer is correct
on the other hand he concludes that even if some credibility could be given to the possibility of a threshold or beneficial effect of radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates the biological and epidemiological evidence that new cancers may be initiated or promoted by radiation exposure can not be completely ruled out
a center for risk analysis said that studies show low levels of radiation might eliminate some cancer but initiate others
