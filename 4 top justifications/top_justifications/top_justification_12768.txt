"Since I introduced my budget -- first budget -- in March of 2010, we've created 50,000 new private-sector jobs for the people of this state."
the ruling christie tied the introduction of his first budget to increased employment in the state saying that since march of last year we created new jobs
but how much can the governor take credit for that increase in jobs when we asked the governor s office to explain how the introduction of christie s first budget sparked job growth a spokesman kevin roberts told us in an email i think you are reading the governor s statement incorrectly as he is clearly using that as a marker in time
but his underlying point that the introduction of his budget spurred that job growth according to most of the experts we spoke with is a stretch
gov chris christie says since he introduced his first budget in march new jersey has added jobs
mckeon needs to have something to say in a state where since i introduced my budget first budget in march of we created new jobs for the people of this state christie said
