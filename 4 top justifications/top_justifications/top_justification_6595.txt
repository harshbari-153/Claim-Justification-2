"More than 40 military tribunals testified."
that s wrong and a similar claim that s now being shared on social media about dozens of ongoing military tribunals also lacks evidence
all of these are unfounded as is the claim that there are more than military tribunals now underway
riot we a claim that military tribunals started at the capitol on the day president joe biden was inaugurated
no dozens of military tribunals aren t underway
in an audio recording that plays over more than minutes the claims range from the possibility that american governors have been arrested or executed to testimony from a chinese communist party defector at over tribunals
