Say New Jersey Reps. Donald Payne and Frank Pallone are "socialists who are openly serving in the U.S. Congress."
bloggers claim new jersey congressmen donald payne and frank pallone are socialists
so payne and pallone have been identified as socialists for being members of the congressional progressive caucus
and for the record both payne and pallone reject being labeled a socialist
but real socialists say those members including payne and pallone aren t socialists
donald payne and frank pallone have been serving in congress for more than two decades as democrats but several blog posts have offered another word to describe both officials
