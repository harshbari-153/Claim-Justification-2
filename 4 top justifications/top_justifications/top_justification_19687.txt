Says Elizabeth Warren "was paid $400,000 to teach one class."
as elizabeth warren closes the night with complaints about cost of college for students just remember she was paid to teach one class
did elizabeth warren get for teaching one class at harvard
a viral image said warren was paid to teach one class
but it s wrong to suggest that all she did was teach one class and the claim leaves out important context about the other work warren was doing at that time
but even if warren taught fewer classes than usual in and saying she was paid to teach one class discounts the research she produced that year and in years previous
