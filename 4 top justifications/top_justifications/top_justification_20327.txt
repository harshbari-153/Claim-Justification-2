"All communications to families from the US Navy have been halted."
hearing rumblings that all communications to families from the us navy have been halted
navy had suddenly cut off communications between military members and their families
neither the navy nor the pentagon would comment on whether any communication blackout between service members and their families had occurred
claim that the navy communication between sailors and their families lacks evidence
but we found no evidence for barton s claim that the navy cut off all communication with families of service members
