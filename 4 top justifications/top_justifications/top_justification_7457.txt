"American oil is â€¦ more affordable" than foreign oil.
mccarthy said that domestic oil is more affordable than foreign oil
it said domestic oil was in itself more affordable compared with saudi arabian oil
kevin mccarthy said domestic oil is more affordable than imported oil it costs more
american oil is cleaner
americans are struggling with gas prices that top a gallon and mccarthy s pitch that oil from home is more affordable might seem like common sense
