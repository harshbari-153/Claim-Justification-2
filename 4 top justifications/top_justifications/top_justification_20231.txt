"I also voted 98 percent of the time with Republicans in the Oregon Legislature."
i also voted percent of the time with republicans in the oregon legislature
yes i voted percent of the time with the majority of democrats
as evidence the campaign tallied the bills from the oregonian s government database and concluded that she voted with the majority of legislators times out of votes cast in s regular session s short session and s regular session
in they voted the same way on out of votes or percent of the time
but it s inaccurate to say that she voted with republicans percent of the time
