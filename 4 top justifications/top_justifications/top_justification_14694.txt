nearly every state that has legalized it has also legislated that you lose your right to own a gun if you are prescribed it or buy it recreationally the may post says

some states have moved to protect the gun rights of medical marijuana users
but we found no evidence that states have legalized marijuana and then enacted their own laws to ban cannabis users from owning a gun
