"[N]early one in three primary care doctors are forced to limit the number of Medicare patients they see."
already nearly one in three primary care doctors are forced to limit the number of medicare patients they see said price who worked as an orthopedic surgeon
the ama s online survey of more than physicians found that percent of primary care doctors restrict the number of medicare patients in their practice
it found that among primary care physicians percent said they accept some or no new medicare patients
some of these doctors don t accept new medicare patients and only treat the ones they already have
price right are nearly one in three primary care doctors forced to limit the number of medicare patients they see the congressman s number seems sensible but his language is overheated
