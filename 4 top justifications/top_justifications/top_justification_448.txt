Under the House health care bill, Medicaid spending "actually goes up 20 percent over the next 10 years."
gingrich said under the house health care bill medicaid spending actually goes up percent over the next years
starting with the billion in spending in medicaid spending would go up steadily each year to reach billion in under the house bill
but it appears he s talking about the rate at which medicaid will grow over the next decade something the program s slated to do whether republicans pass a health care law or not
keep in mind that medicaid spending goes up under any scenario
a similar analysis for the bill that passed the house in may would winnow medicaid spending by billion in the same time frame
