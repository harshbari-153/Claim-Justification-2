A federal pilot program to DNA test illegal immigrants showed "something like 30% (of test subjects) are fake families."
cuccinelli said a federal pilot program to dna test illegal immigrants showed something like of test subjects are fake families
so earlier this year the administration rolled out a pilot program to dna test some groups apprehended at the border who purported to be family units as a way to determine if they are in fact related
the trump administration is using dna tests to crack down on fake families at the border
during a pilot operation from may dna testing revealed a portion of the groups caught crossing the border illegally had lied about being related
while the dna testing program uncovered cases of migrant groups lying about being families the federal data we found showed the rate of fraudulent families was lower than cuccinelli s figure
