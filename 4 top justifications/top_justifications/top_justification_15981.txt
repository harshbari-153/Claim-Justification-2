unfortunately we have documented instances where people defecated in the building
did protesters really defecate in the statehouse we asked niehaus staff about the documented instances and were told that several were reported to the senator and that he confirmed them with statehouse management
there was defecation in the stairwell to the parking garage said csrab spokesman gregg dodd but not inside the statehouse
but niehaus key accusation dealt with defecation
in the context of his statement he clearly was suggesting that protesters soiled the floor and that it happened inside the statehouse
