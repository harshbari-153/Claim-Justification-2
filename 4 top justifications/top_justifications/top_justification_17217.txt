Says Hillary Clinton "threatened to bomb Iran — totally obliterate them — if she was president."
at the time a reuters report on the abc interview said that clinton wanted to make clear to tehran what she was prepared to do as president in hopes that this warning would deter any iranian nuclear attack against the jewish state
during a presidential debate a week earlier clinton promised massive retaliation against any iranian attack on israel according to reuters
during the abc interview clinton says well the question was if iran were to launch a nuclear attack on israel what would our response be
first clinton doesn t repeat if i m president we will attack iran as the video makes it seem
whatever stage of development they might be clinton says in their nuclear weapons program in the next years during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on israel we would be able to totally obliterate them
