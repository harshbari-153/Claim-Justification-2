In 1993, Newt Gingrich "first advocated for the individual mandate in health care. And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating" for it.
in bachmann said gingrich first advocated for the individual mandate in health care
what about the claim that gingrich was advocating for the individual mandate as recently as may a point well after virtually all mainstream republicans had come out against such a requirement
still in our view the fact that gingrich supported the bond idea in the meet the press interview muddies the waters enough to weaken the argument bachmann made that as recently as may of this year he was still advocating for the individual mandate in health care
but was what gingrich said in the meet the press interview really advocating for the individual mandate in health care as bachmann said in the des moines debate
gingrich calls it a variation on the individual mandate the idea that people take responsibility for their health care either by purchasing health insurance or by posting a bond to pay for any health care they may eventually need
