"In America, there is a father who is holding down two jobs and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America."
in america there is a father who is holding down two jobs and paying more taxes than the richest families in america
harris said in america there is a father who is holding down two jobs and paying more taxes than the richest families in america
what harris should have said is that the father holding down two jobs is paying a larger share of his income in taxes than the average richest families are paying in taxes relative to their incomes
so to use harris example a typical father with two jobs pays a higher tax rate than the richest american families according to one study by prominent economists
in dollar terms the father holding down two jobs is certainly paying less in taxes than the taxes paid by the richest families reschovsky told us
