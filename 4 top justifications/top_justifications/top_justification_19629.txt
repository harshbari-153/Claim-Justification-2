Medicare "only has about 50 percent of it paid for by either premiums or payroll taxes, and the rest is deficit spending ... or debt spending."
medicare pawlenty said only has about percent of it paid for by either premiums or payroll taxes and the rest is deficit spending and debit spending or debt spending
pawlenty says half of medicare paid for with deficit spending
okay but what about the second half of the statement that the rest of medicare expenses came from deficit spending
let start with the first half of pawlenty statement that only about percent of medicare is paid for by either premiums or payroll taxes
but inasmuch as medicare has always been supplemented by general revenues we think it a little misleading to characterize anything not paid by medicare payroll taxes or patient premiums as deficit spending
