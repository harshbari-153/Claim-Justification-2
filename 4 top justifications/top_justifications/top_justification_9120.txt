"Mark Harris has said he would cut Social Security and Medicare."
mark harris has said he would cut social security and medicare mccready said
mccready claimed harris has said he would cut social security and medicare
mccready then presented a argument for how harris has indicated intentions to cut medicare and social security
so it would be politically risky for a candidate to declare his desire to cut medicare and social security
but on social security it s clear from his past and recent statements that his hopes for reform include changes that would limit future government payouts
