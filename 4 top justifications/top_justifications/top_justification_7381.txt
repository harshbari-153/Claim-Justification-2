because of johnson s leadership senate republicans adopted a caucus ban on earmarks showing the american people they re serious about cutting government waste and corruption
placed johnson among a group of incoming senators publicly backing a ban on earmarks those tasty pieces of pork sprinkled by the thousands into the federal budget by individual lawmakers
mcconnell and inhofe reportedly lobbied new members to vote against the earmark ban although johnson says he was not contacted
so where does that leave us in the wake of the earmarks vote the state republican party credited johnson s leadership for its passage
the ban was opposed publicly by the senate minority leader putting the outcome of the vote in question
