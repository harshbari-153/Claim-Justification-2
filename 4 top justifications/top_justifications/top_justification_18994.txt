"When we go to vote, they ask for driver's license and verify that you are a voter and a citizen in the state of Texas."
shami said when we go to vote they ask for driver license and verify that you are a voter and a citizen in the state of texas
shami is correct that poll workers verify that voters are registered and voters can use a driver license as a substitute for their registration card
but state law does require poll workers to ask voters for their license and voters can use other forms of id to cast their ballots
so state law does require voters to show a driver license but do poll workers still ask for it apparently not in harris county
you can register to vote if you do have a driver license or a social security number but you be flagged on the official voter registration list with an id annotation which cues poll workers to request another form of id in addition to your voter card
