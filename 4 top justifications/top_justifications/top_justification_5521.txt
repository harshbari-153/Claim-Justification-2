Says "President Obama fired every Bush appointed ambassador upon his election."
president obama fired every bush appointed ambassador upon his election
so it s not accurate to say that obama fired every bush appointed ambassador
we wondered whether it was true that obama fired all of bush s ambassadors
but he s applying the practice of replacing political appointees and wrongly characterizing what obama did to a large extent to career diplomats
no obama did fire all of bush ambassadors
