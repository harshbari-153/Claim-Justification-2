Says Patrick Murphy has "taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress other than the speaker and the majority leader."
grayson said murphy has taken more money from wall street than any other member of congress other than the speaker and the majority leader
he continued his name is patrick murphy and he taken more money from wall street than any other member of congress other than the speaker and the majority leader
but technically grayson s statement to the editorial board said murphy received more money than anyone else in congress which comprises two chambers
grayson is right that in the cycle murphy raised more money from employees of wall fields than any other house member after the house speaker and majority leader
murphy has raised more money from three other sectors than wall street in his campaign
