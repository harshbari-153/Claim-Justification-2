Limiting labor negotiations to only wages is "how it is for the most part in the private sector."
in arguing public employee unions ought to be treated more like their their private sector counterparts she said for the most part private contract talks are limited to wages
however the national labor relations act make it clear private employers with unions are not only allowed to bargain on many other issues that law requires the subjects be about far more than just wages
darling added the governor is proposing that we have collective bargaining deal only with wages which is how it is for the most part in the private sector
and we took a look at federal law the national labor relations act which governs most private employers
but private sector unions are covered by a federal law and generally bargain on all sorts of things
