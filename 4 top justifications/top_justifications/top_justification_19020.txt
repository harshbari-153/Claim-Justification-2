Democrats say Chafee wants to tax equipment that enables amputee veterans to drive
democrats say chafee would tax amputee veterans
but when we saw the association s claim that the list of exempt items that chafee would tax includes equipment that enables amputee veterans to drive it sounded too strange not to check
however because the chafee campaign acknowledges that he would tax all items on a list of exemptions it does not change the assertion that the former senator would tax the driving equipment
update after this item was published we learned that the driving equipment for amputee veterans would be paid for by the federal government for those injured in the line of duty
and yes so is the driving equipment for amputees
