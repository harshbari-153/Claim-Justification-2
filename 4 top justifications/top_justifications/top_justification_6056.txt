Says Mike Enzi is "getting about 84 percent of his campaign funds from Washington-based PACs. That's more than any senator of either party."
dick cheney says daughter opponent mike enzi gets larger percentage of pac money than any other senator
a large chunk of enzi s pac money comes from congressional leadership groups who are backing the senior senator over cheney s challenge
it s not that enzi is taking more money from pacs than all of his colleagues but a higher proportion of his money raised is from these outside groups
using the center s data enzi s percentage of pac money is higher than any other senator by quite a bit actually
while dick cheney differed from our nonpartisan sources on the final number the fact remains he was right enzi has received a higher proportion of his money from pacs than anyone in the senate
