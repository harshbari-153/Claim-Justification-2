Says singer Charlie Daniels said, "voting for Trump is like playing country music backwards â€¦ you get your house back, your car back, your job back, your country back!"
voting for trump is like playing country music backwards you get your house back your car back your job back your country back
no charlie daniels never said voting for trump is like playing country music backwards
well now that saying has been twisted into something political and misattributed to country music star charlie daniels in posts that have recently appeared on facebook
while daniels has written about politics on a section of his band s website called soap box and has shown support for trump on his twitter account we could find no evidence that he ever said this
the new version claims daniels said
