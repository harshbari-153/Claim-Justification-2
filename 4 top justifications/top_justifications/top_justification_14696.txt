"Medicare does just as good, if not better, at keeping people healthy" as Medicare Advantage.
president obama said medicare does just as good if not better at keeping people healthy as medicare advantage
we asked the white house what evidence it had to show that medicare does just as good if not better at keeping people healthy as medicare advantage
so it possible that medicare advantage is paid more to take care of healthier seniors
but the report also noted how difficult it is to compare medicare advantage with traditional medicare
we did see any advice that drew broad conclusions about which was better medicare or medicare advantage
