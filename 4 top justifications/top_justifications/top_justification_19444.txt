Says Ken Cuccinelli wants "to eliminate all forms of birth control."
nextgen climate action committee says cuccinelli wants to eliminate all forms of birth control
but the editorial made no assertion cuccinelli wants to ban all birth control devices
nextgen doesn t have a speck of proof to bolster its incendiary claim that cuccinelli wants to ban all forms of birth control even condoms and spermicides
no basis to nextgen claim cuccinelli wants to ban all contraception
cuccinelli has repeatedly said he has no interest in restricting contraception which generally works by preventing ovulation or the fertilization of a human egg
