Says that in the U.S. House of Representatives "we’ve had bipartisan support for the repeal of Obamacare … for getting rid of cap and trade … for building the Keystone Pipeline."
we asked blackburn s communications director mike reynard for the supporting evidence that there was in fact bipartisan support reflected in floor votes for repeal of the affordable care act obamacare for getting rid of cap and trade and for building the keystone xl pipeline from canada to texas
blackburn s full statement went like this in the house we had bipartisan support for the repeal of obamacare bipartisan support for moving forward with the budget
we have had bipartisan support for getting rid of cap and trade and stopping that
we had bipartisan support for building the keystone pipeline
so technically there was bipartisan support for building the pipeline in the house but nothing happened
