"When we look at the number of murders in the United States (in) 2009, we had 9,500 people murdered. When we look around the world, we see ... large countries, the U.K., Germany, Japan had 200 or less killed in a year."
so japan and the united kingdom were well within lautenberg stated threshold of murders per year
in any case for the most recent year available we found that the united kingdom had firearm murders and germany had firearm murders
germany japan had or less killed in a year
we took firearm murder rates that is firearm murders per people for a variety of nations across the globe then used national population statistics to the number of firearm murders in both countries
for and he was accurate in saying that japan and the united kingdom had fewer than firearm murders
