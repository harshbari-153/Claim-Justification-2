"In 1950, corporations paid $3 in taxes for every $1 by a worker. Today, they pay 22 cents for every $1 by a worker."
in the ratio was cents paid by corporations for every dollar by workers
in corporations paid cents in income taxes for every dollar in income taxes paid by individuals
it read according to the office of management and budget back in corporations paid in taxes for every by a worker
using this formula the ratio in was cents paid by corporations for every dollar paid by workers even more incorrect than it was using our first calculation
in corporations paid cents in income taxes for every dollar of income taxes paid by individuals nowhere near the ratio claimed in the facebook post
