Housing prices dropped for the 30 months prior to Barack Obama taking office, "and they have stabilized, they've been about flat since the president came in."
housing prices have been dropping for straight months when the president walked into the oval office and they have stabilized they been about flat since the president came in
most of the statistics we looked at show that housing prices have continued to decline though at a slower rate since obama took office and the decline is especially clear over the last six months to a year
using these measures then donovan overstated the case when he said that housing prices dropped for straight months when the president walked into the oval office
we were most interested in donovan s recap of housing price trends so we checked to see whether housing prices did indeed drop for straight months when the president walked into the oval office and they have stabilized they been about flat since the president came in
we checked their numbers and using this number hud is right that home prices declined for more than consecutive months prior to obama taking office
