"If I had not asked for my emails all to be made public, none of this would have been in the public arena."
because if i had not asked for my emails all to be made public none of this would have been in the public arena
clinton said if i had not asked for my emails all to be made public none of this would have been in the public arena
hillary clinton emails would be public if i had asked for it
but it isn t quite right to say that if she hadn t made that request her emails would not now be in the public arena
but even if she had not made that request there were other people pushing to make the emails public
