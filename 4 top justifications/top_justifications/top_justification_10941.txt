The 2010 DREAM Act failed despite "strong bipartisan support."
the dream act failed on a cloture vote where votes are needed to advance the bill
actually the dream act seems a rather weak display of bipartisanship
napolitano said that the dream act a law that would have allowed young people in the united states illegally to stay failed in congress even though it had strong bipartisan support
and in fact the dream act vote stands in contrast to more recent senate votes which had much more bipartisan support
the bill failed because it required votes
