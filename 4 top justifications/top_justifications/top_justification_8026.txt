"The average unemployed American has been out of work for almost 40 weeks."
the median unemployed worker was out of work for weeks in may a little more than half of the average length of unemployment
the latest economic data have dashed any hope of a quick end to america s job drought which has already gone on so long that the average unemployed american has been out of work for almost weeks he wrote
but he was careful in his wording referring to the average unemployed american rather than say the typical unemployed american
also the difference between average and median weeks unemployed has been more or less steady over the years pretty close to the same ratio we see today
this result likely happened because there were a modest number of people with very very long unemployment spells as well as a much larger number who had relatively short periods of unemployment
