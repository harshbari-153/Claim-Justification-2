"It isn't me cutting the budget. It's the Congress'Â decision on sequestration. So it isn't secretary of defense or the president doing this."
so it isn t the secretary of defense or the president doing this and i think we should clear that up a little bit here too
it s the congress decision on sequestration
it isn t me cutting the budget he said
hagel said it wasn t he or obama that made defense cuts it was congress in passing the sequester
the deal left it up to congress and the department of defense to determine how the cuts would be distributed
