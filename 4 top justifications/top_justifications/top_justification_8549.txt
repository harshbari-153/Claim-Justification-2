Sewer backups into basements caused the "vast majority of the damage to homes and buildings" in Milwaukee’s July floods, but federal flood insurance doesn’t cover them.
milwaukee ald jim bohl says sewer backups caused most of the damage in july floods and federal flood insurance doesn t cover it
plain and simple flood insurance does not cover damage caused by sewer discharge backups in basements and by far that is exactly what caused the vast majority of damage to homes and buildings in milwaukee in july bohl said in the release
it is true that damage from sewer backups is not covered under the federal flood insurance
the milwaukee metropolitan sewerage district has no data on basement flooding causes but spokesman bill graffin said the main culprit behind basement backups and sewer overflows is excess water getting into sanitary sewer pipes
nobody has a clear answer on whether sewer backups into basements caused the vast majority of the damage
