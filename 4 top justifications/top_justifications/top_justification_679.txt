After Arizona banned smoking in "all public places" in 2007, "admissions for acute myocardial infarction â€¦ stroke, asthma, [and] angina decreased following the implementation of the ban."
the state of arizona in banned smoking in all public places and an unintended consequence of that in the first year alone the admissions for acute myocardial infarction or heart attack for a better term stroke asthma angina decreased following the implementation of the ban
our ruling to prove the effectiveness of broad smoking bans in improving public health representative morrison pointed to arizona s experience
could arizona really have seen nearly immediate benefits from its smoking ban states and the district of columbia currently have some type of statewide indoor smoking ban in place
arizona s statewide ban on smoking does not go as far as new york city s ban or morrison s proposal for rhode island
the arizona act prohibits smoking in workplaces as well as restaurants bars and other enclosed public places but does not apply to parks or other outdoor spaces
