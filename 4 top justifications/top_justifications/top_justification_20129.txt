On the new dollar coins, "'In God We Trust' is gone!"
claims god we trust removed from dollar coins
the latest example comes from a chain claiming that newly released dollar coins do not contain the words in god we trust
since all of the coins in the presidential series have had in god we trust inscribed on the front
we should note that it is possible though extremely rare to find one of the original coins without the in god we trust side inscription
the law changed in and specified that in god we trust appear on the front of the coin the heads side rather than the edge
