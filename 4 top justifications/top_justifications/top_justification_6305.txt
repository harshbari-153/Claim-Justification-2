A video shows crowds shouting profanity at Joe Biden.
this video of people shouting profanity at biden is not real the profane chants were edited in
the video posted march on facebook is a compilation of clips from three biden speeches and it claims to show him being heckled by the crowds
in the last two clips chants of f joe biden can be heard
the crowd chanted let s go joe and then biden began to speak
it gives the impression that biden paused his speech as the crowd chanted f joe biden and then said i tell you what man
