"I never had a filibuster-proof Senate."
bill clinton says he never had a senate
and so we decided to do a little research into clinton claim that he never had a senate
well i think for one thing i had to do a little more of that reaching out to republicans because i never had a senate clinton said
a filibuster is an attempt by the minority party to try to block a vote on issue
it gave republicans votes enough to at least threaten a filibuster
