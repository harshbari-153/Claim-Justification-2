"We had a three-hour debate, no discussion about the national debt, very little about the economy."
we had a debate no discussion about the national debt very little about the economy
rubio said we had a debate no discussion about the national debt very little about the economy
what did the candidates really discuss during the debate we reviewed the transcript and wouldn t say there was no discussion about the debt but rubio has a point there was little said about the economy
marco rubio says cnn debate had no question on debt and little about the economy
so candidates did discuss the economy though with little in the way of concrete plans
