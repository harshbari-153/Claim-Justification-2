"Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4"
countries bombed obama bush
lizza said that obama has bombed seven countries to bush s four
lizza says obama has bombed more nations than bush
airstrikes in those places continued under obama
this would increase bush s total to five countries rather than the four lizza cited
