"Nobodyâ€™s health is at risk right now" from PFAS contamination, as long as they are receiving bottled drinking water
people who have wells that test for elevated levels of pfas are currently being provided clean drinking water at the expense of the responsible party so nobody s health is at risk right now he said
while precautions put in place to provide safe drinking water have helped mitigate the problem in the short term residents can still ingest pfas through other means such as meat or fish hunted from nearby land or possibly even produce harvested from areas where pfas are present in the soil
parties responsible for elevated levels of specific pfas substances have supplied affected communities with bottled water or water filtration systems in the near term while working closely with regulators and community members on potable water solutions to ensure no one s health or safety is put at risk
manley claimed that no one s health is at risk if they re receiving bottled drinking water due to contamination in their home s water supply
so even though residents may have access to clean water via deliveries of bottled water there is still a risk of consuming contaminated produce fish or meat from the area which could contribute to a buildup of pfas in the body
