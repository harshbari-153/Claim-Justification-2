"Trey Radel does not even qualify to drive a Lee County school bus at this point, yet he occupies a seat in Congress."
the sad reality is that trey radel does not even qualify to drive a lee county school bus at this point yet he occupies a seat in congress
in a facebook post vowing to advocate for radel s replacement scott said the sad reality is that trey radel does not even qualify to drive a lee county school bus at this point yet he occupies a seat in congress
on the unlikely chance that radel plans to apply to be a lee county school district bus driver would his conviction mean he wouldn t qualify
is scott correct that radel s cocaine possession conviction means he would not meet the qualifications to drive a lee county school bus
but scott is correct that radel s drug conviction has put the brakes on him becoming a bus driver
