Says "in this next biennium, the cost of primary and secondary education is going to increase by more that $1000 per student. Half of that $1000 – $500 per student – is accounted for by the increased cost of PERS alone."
in this next biennium the cost of primary and secondary education is going to increase by more than per student
cleary told us that based on their estimates the cost of pers in education for the next biennium was predicted to rise by million
are increased pers costs responsible for a per student increase in state spending
half of that per student is accounted for by the increased cost of pers alone this isn t the first time the governor has made this exact claim so we thought it was time we checked it out
kitzhaber has said on several occasions most recently in his state of the state address that if nothing changes the state will be spending about more per student to cover the cost of pers in the next biennium
