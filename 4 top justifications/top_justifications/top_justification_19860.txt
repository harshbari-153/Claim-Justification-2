"We just canâ€™t afford to pay 100 percent of government employee benefits."
so what about the claim that we just can t afford to pay percent of government employee benefits
more problematic is the headlined statement we just ca afford to pay percent of government employee benefits too
on the back in large type a headline makes this claim we just ca afford to pay percent of government employee benefits too
many governments could not afford to pickup the total bill for health and pension benefits
in this tough economy the text continues it just not fair to ask taxpayers to pay even more for salaries and benefits for government employees
