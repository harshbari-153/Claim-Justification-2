we have that program where immigrants come here and they have to bring a million dollars in order to get a green card if they re going to create jobs he lamented
there is a program where immigrants can funnel million into the u
but you know what if an immigrant comes here and they re willing to create jobs and they re willing to contribute to our economy we have to make it easier for the kinds of immigrants we want because that is the past of america that s our greatness and that will continue to be our greatness in the future
and contrary to greene assertion immigrants do have to participate in this exchange
we wondered what does a green card go for these days to be sure green cards are the key to legal life for immigrants in the united states
