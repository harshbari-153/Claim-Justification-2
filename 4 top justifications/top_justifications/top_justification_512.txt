"Obamacare â€¦ means that for up to 20 million Americans, they will lose the insurance they currently have, the insurance that they like and they want to keep."
our ruling romney said that obamacare means that for up to million americans they will lose the insurance they currently have the insurance that they like and they want to keep
following the supreme court s decision upholding president barack obama s health care law mitt romney claimed in a speech that obamacare means that for up to million americans they will lose the insurance they currently have the insurance that they like and they want to keep
mitt romney says obamacare means up to million americans will lose insurance they like and want
some who lose coverage will do so because they find better options even beyond the romney is wrong to say that million americans will lose the insurance that they like and they want to keep
romney acts as if no one ever loses coverage today as we have previously noted many americans lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law though figuring out exactly how many is surprisingly tricky
