The Obama administration "manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration."
they manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the border patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the bush administration dobbs said july
dobbs said the federal government manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the border patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the bush administration
now we want to look at dobbs accusation that the obama administration manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the border patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the bush administration
deportations or removals under obama are tracking higher than during the bush years using the most literal deportation statistics as well as those solely from ice
that strategy is rooted in previous administrations but was accelerated by obama so that people trying to cross the border illegally face more significant consequences and receive formal deportation orders
