"Beware - George Soros is starting a Fake News site in Missouri"
in a facebook post the group told their supporters beware george soros is starting a fake news site in missouri
liberty alliance said george soros is starting a fake news site in missouri referring to the missouri independent but there s no evidence of soros being involved
but i m gon na tell you this i am not going to respond to a nonprofit out of virginia that is absolutely a propaganda news this political agenda whether it s george soros or people like him of what you re gon na be doing is not fair to missouri outlets
george soros is not the mastermind behind startup news outlet the missouri independent
soros has also been the target of countless conspiracy theories including that he is a former nazi officer that he s made it his life s mission to destroy the united states and that he instigated racial protests in charlottesville va
