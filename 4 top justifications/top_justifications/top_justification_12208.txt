mostly false democrat says paul manafort visited moscow during campaign
while we have reported on the ties of manafort trump s former campaign chairman to russian interests we wondered about waters claim that he and others visited moscow during the campaign
waters said that manafort and others with ties to the trump campaign went to moscow during the presidential campaign
