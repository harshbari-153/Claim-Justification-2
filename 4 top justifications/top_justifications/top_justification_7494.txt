Says President Barack Obamaâ€™s nominees met a standard of 60 votes, "a standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices."
in an interview on msnbc s morning joe show durbin said obama s nominees met a standard of votes a standard that was met by elena kagan as well as sonia sotomayor president obama choices
a standard that was met by elena kagan as well as sonia sotomayor president obama choices durbin told the show s hosts
on the surface the margins achieved by sotomayor and kagan would seem to support durbin s argument that the confirmations required votes
obama s nominees cleared the procedural hurdles and won votes and then some
kagan and sotomayor ultimately would have had enough votes to be able to break a filibuster but they never had to and the margins they got on the final vote can t be used to retroactively define what the standard was
