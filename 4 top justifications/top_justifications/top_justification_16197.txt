"Bill Gates fights to keep vaccine ingredients secret."
wielding a clip from a recent interview that microsoft and vaccine advocate bill gates gave to the british news channel sky news a video circulating on facebook wrongly claims that gates is fighting to keep vaccine ingredients secret
but defending intellectual property rights does not mean that gates is advocating for keeping the ingredients in vaccines secret as the facebook post claims
no bill gates isn t fighting to keep vaccine ingredients secret they re already public
in the interview which sky news posted on youtube on april the reporter asked gates if it would be helpful for intellectual property law to change so that companies that developed vaccines such as pfizer and johnson johnson could share their recipe for these vaccines
asked why not gates downplayed the role of intellectual property concerns in restricting vaccine supplies and pointed to the importance of safe manufacturing
