"An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views."
an amendment pushed by lyndon johnson many years ago threatens religious institutions with a loss of their status if they openly advocate their political views
trump said an amendment pushed by lyndon johnson many years ago threatens religious institutions with a loss of their status if they openly advocate their political views
we were curious about the issue and whether an amendment constitutional or otherwise prevents the practice for religious institutions
johnson then democratic minority leader responded by introducing an amendment to section c of the federal tax code dealing with charitable organizations including groups organized and operated exclusively for religious charitable scientific literacy and educational purposes or to prevent cruelty to children or animals
nonetheless the threat of losing status persists as long as the law is in place and religious groups particularly evangelicals have regarded it as a suppression of free speech and an entanglement of the irs in the operation of their religion
