"There is no record of congresswoman Betty Sutton ... ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public."
in a stunning and stark contrast there is no record of congresswoman betty sutton who has been in office for the better part of a decade ever holding a single town hall meeting open to the general public and she certainly has never done so while running to represent the district the news release said
in light of that evidence politifact ohio asked renacci s campaign for the basis of its claim that there s no record of sutton ever holding a single town hall meeting open to the general public
but his claim that there is no record of sutton ever holding a single town hall meeting open to the general public does not stand up to scrutiny
jim renacci says betty sutton has never held a town hall meeting with constituents
has sutton really never held open meetings with constituents politifact ohio decided to check out the claim particularly since it has seen news releases about town hall meetings that sutton had scheduled during her three terms in office
