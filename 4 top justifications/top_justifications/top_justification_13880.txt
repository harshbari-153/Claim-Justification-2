Georgia's U.S. senators voted for legislation that would "gut clean air protections and increase oil dependence."
we also wanted to know if chambliss and isakson voted for legislation that gut clear air protections and increase oil dependence
chambliss said in a speech on the senate floor that day that the epa actions would require more farmers to get federal clean air act permits hurting many of them financially
so would the murkowski bill gut clean air protections and increase oil dependence first we must go back to
bush a republican that the clean air act does not treat carbon dioxide and other gases as pollutants and thus does not give the epa the authority to regulate them
jonas monast who has expertise in federal climate protection policies agreed murkowski legislation would adversely impact the epa ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions
