"If the experiences in Colorado and Washington are the experiences we have here, roadway deaths are going to go up, impaired driving is likely to go up."
if the experiences in colorado and washington are the experiences we have here roadway deaths are going to go up impaired driving is likely to go up anderson said
based on our research anderson s statement that roadway deaths and impaired driving rates have gone up in washington and colorado is correct
the sources all show that rates of impaired driving and roadway fatalities have increased since cannabis was legalized
the upward trend in fatalities in colorado and to some extent in washington would have taken place whether or not recreational cannabis was legalized the authors say
so we decided to find out have legal recreational cannabis markets in colorado and washington led to a rise in roadway deaths and impaired driving rates
