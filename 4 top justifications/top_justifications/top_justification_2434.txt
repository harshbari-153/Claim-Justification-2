"Two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. â€¦ It didn't get covered"
conway said that two iraqis came here to this country were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the bowling green massacre
i bet it information to people that president obama had a ban on the iraqi refugee program after two iraqis came here to this country were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the bowling green massacre she said
at root this was a case of two iraqis with dangerous backgrounds who were duped by the fbi into believing they were helping islamic insurgents fight americans overseas
that was just one of a number of inaccurate statements circulating at the time about terrorist activities in and around bowling green ky
when white house counselor kellyanne conway appeared at a town hall event with msnbc s chris matthews she mentioned the bowling green massacre a terrorist attack that the social media world would quickly determine did not exist
