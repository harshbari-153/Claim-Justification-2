if you need to call but are scared to because of someone in the room dial and ask for a pepperoni pizza
the post gives the impression that asking for a pepperoni pizza is somehow a secret code to the operator lapd said on twitter
in a reddit user who said they were a operator published a post that said a woman called and ordered a pizza because she was in the room with someone who couldn t know she was reporting an emergency
it goes on to claim that the dispatcher will ask if the caller knows they re calling
if a voice call is an absolutely must the agency wrote your options for discretion are not limited to ordering a pepperoni pizza
