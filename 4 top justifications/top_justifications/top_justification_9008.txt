After attacking Emma Gonzalez, U.S. Rep. Steve King is "facing arrest."
steve king faces arrest after attacking parkland survivor emma gonzalez for wearing a jacket with the cuban flag
headline falsely says steve king facing arrest after comment about emma gonzalez and cuba
a headline on political thinkers about king said that congressman just annihilated parkland victim in calling her out now he s facing arrest while king s comments about gonzalez wearing a patch of the cuban flag prompted a group to file a complaint with the office of congressional ethics such complaints often lead to no action
it would be extraordinarily rare for any such complaint to the ethics office to lead to arrest and there is no evidence that king faces arrest
we found no evidence that king faces arrest
