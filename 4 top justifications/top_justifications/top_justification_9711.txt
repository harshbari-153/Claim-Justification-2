"In the past four years, (the U.S. Senate) has only passed nine out of 48 appropriation bills."
senate has only passed nine out of appropriation bills in the past four years
in the past four years it has only passed nine out of appropriation bills
and in fiscal while the senate passed nine spending bills it did not pass regular order spending bills for financial services and human and the state department and foreign operations
so what does this mean has the senate been derelict in its duties
senate really passed little more than of the appropriations bills that have come before it as kingston claims we decided to track down the numbers and check out the claim
