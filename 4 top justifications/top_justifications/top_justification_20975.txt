Says in fiscal year 2011, the state had "a projected $11 billion deficit."
when the fiscal budget year came around new jersey still had a projected structural deficit of about
but there s a problem with his claim about a projected billion deficit for fiscal year
a structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all spending obligations required by statute were fully funded
billion structural deficit the state s nonpartisan office of legislative service projected for the fiscal year budget when christie proposed his first spending plan
as we did in august we re looking only at the claim of an billion budget deficit for fiscal year and the budget being balanced
