"Roy Cooper won't say how he will pay for ‘free’ college tuition."
but just because cooper has detailed how he would pay for community college tuition does mean he has no plan whatsoever
does cooper really propose offering free college tuition and does he lack a plan to pay for it
but cooper plan says the state shouldn t pay for percent of the tuition
he has said what the state wo pay for the full cost of tuition and one way he won t pay for it tax hikes but it s correct to say that cooper does not have a specific plan or at least one that s publicly available for paying for his proposal
just like bev perdue roy cooper wo say how he will pay for free college tuition mccrory said in a facebook post
