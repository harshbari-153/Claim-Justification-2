Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, cast votes for TARP, the stimulus, and an individual mandate for health care.
we checked to see whether bennett did indeed vote for tarp the stimulus and a requirement that individuals purchase health coverage
here what we found bennett did vote for the tarp legislation h
but he was incorrect that bennett voted for obama stimulus bill and it was inaccurate for him to suggest that bennett cast a vote for an individual mandate
all told will was correct that bennett voted for the tarp bill
george will pegs bennett loss to votes on tarp stimulus health care
