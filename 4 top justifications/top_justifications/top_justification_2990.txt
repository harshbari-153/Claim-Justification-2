The American Academy of Pediatrics "supports banning guns."
the american academy of pediatrics supports banning guns she said
we can not make a judgment on that but we can assess her claim that the american academy of pediatrics supports banning guns
the policy paper clearly supports banning handguns and assault weapons but it does not explicitly advocate a complete ban on guns which likely would require an amendment to the u
other recommendations include urging pediatricians to inform parents about the danger of guns advocating for trigger locks and other safety mechanisms and supporting the development of nonviolent television programs and video games
we believe that handguns deadly air guns and assault weapons should be banned
