"National studies are already showing the negative effects that the health care law is having on businesses and our economy. Businesses across the country are raising their prices â€¦ (or) cutting jobs as a result of the added cost."
unfortunately national studies are already showing the negative effects that the health care law is having on businesses and our economy
our ruling bondi said national studies are already showing the negative effects that the health care law is having on businesses and our economy
this comment caught our attention because added costs for business under the health care law do not start until
it s true that some large businesses specifically those with more than employees who do not currently offer their employees health insurance will face new costs because of the health care law
we don t doubt there s anxiety among some businesses over what s to come under the health care law and maybe some are talking about whether they ll have to raise prices or cut jobs
