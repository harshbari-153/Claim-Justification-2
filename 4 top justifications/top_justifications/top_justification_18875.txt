Says proposed teacher contract "would layer on more restrictive rules."
does a proposed portland teacher contract include more restrictive rules
in an opinion piece published in the oregonian june board members argued that the proposal currently floated by the teachers association would layer on more restrictive rules
but ultimately we come back to the school board statement which is that this contract proposal would layer on more restrictive rules
and teachers would argue they need the rules to protect their time in the face of growing district mandates
in the piece they say the proposed contract does this by prohibiting increases in instructional time in any school above the amount currently in place
