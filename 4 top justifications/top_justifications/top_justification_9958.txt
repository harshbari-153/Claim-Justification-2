"I donâ€™t need" the COVID-19 vaccine. "I have natural immunity" that lasts "forever."
research into how long natural immunity lasts is ongoing but findings to date do not support shirkey s assertion that he has lifelong immunity that offers the same level of protection as the vaccine
shirkey claimed that he does not need to get vaccinated because the natural immunity from his previous infection lasts forever
people who have had are known to develop some immunity but experts don t know how long that immunity lasts
the focus should be on an individual s antibodies to the virus not just whether they had a vaccine shirkey s chief of staff jeremy hendges told politifact adding there are obviously questions about how long the vaccines are effective
and his comment contradicts the recommendation of health experts who say that the vaccines offer greater protection from reinfection than any immunity developed from a previous infection
