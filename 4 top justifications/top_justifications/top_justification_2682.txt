The Obama administrationâ€™s "own Environmental Protection Agency" has said its Clean Power Plan "will have a marginal impact on climate change."
in the debate walker said the obama administration s own environmental protection agency has said its clean power plan will have a marginal impact on climate change
did the epa the agency administering the clean power plan say the plan s regulations would have only a marginal effect on climate change
as for the the epa it has described the clean power plan as a necessary though not sufficient step in addressing climate change and as part of a larger strategy to spur other nations to reduce emissions
so the head of the epa acknowledges that the clean power plan since it applies only to the united states can have only a limited impact on global climate change
even the epa says obama carbon plan will only marginally affect climate change scott walker says
