Proposed tax changes are a "handout" to BP.
mitchell kane a professor at new york university law school who specializes in international corporate taxation said the use of the term handout in this context is highly misleading noting that there would be no change at all to bp tax liability
instead we focus on whether the ad is justified in calling such changes a handout to bp or other foreign companies
national taxpayers union ad blasts tax proposal as handout for bp
our aim is to gauge whether the ad is accurate when it says that making these changes would amount to a handout to companies like bp
still we think the term handout in this context is questionable even hypocritical since the tax policy the oil companies want to keep in place could easily be described as involving longstanding handouts for them
