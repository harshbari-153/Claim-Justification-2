GOP candidate for California governor Travis Allen "on the floor vote â€¦ refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens."
john cox s campaign for governor claimed in a recent tv ad that travis allen on the floor vote refused to join republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens
in this we ll examine the ad s separate allegation that on the floor vote allen refused to join republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens
legislative records show allen voted against a bill that allowed undocumented californians to apply for a state drivers license during a floor vote in the state assembly in may
did allen who has positioned himself as a staunch opponent of benefits for undocumented californians really miss this key vote
did travis allen oppose driver licenses for undocumented immigrants
