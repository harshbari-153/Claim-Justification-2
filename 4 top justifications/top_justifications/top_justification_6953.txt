John Boehner wants to reopen a tax loophole "that actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas."
we obama statement that john boehner wants to reopen a tax loopholes that actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas
you know how we paid for it by closing one of these ridiculous tax loopholes that actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas
i mean even a lot of america biggest corporations agreed that this loophole did make sense agreed that it needed to be closed agreed that it was fair but the man who thinks he going to be speaker he wants to reopen this loophole
the point we question is whether the tax loophole will result in jobs being shipped overseas
obama said boehner opposes tax rule to keep profits and jobs in the usa
