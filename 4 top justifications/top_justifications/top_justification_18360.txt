More money is dedicated within the Department of Homeland Security to climate change than what's spent combating "Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the Internet in the United States of America."
in fact within the department of homeland security more money in fact millions of dollars are dedicated to climate change rather than combating what i consider to be one of the biggest threats to the homeland and that the violent extremists radicalizing islamist terrorists radicalizing over the internet in the united states of america
but in reality it s a tightly scripted message comparing spending within the department of homeland security on climate change to the money spent preventing islamist terrorists from using the internet to spread messages in the united states
mccaul said that the homeland security budget has more money dedicated to climate change than combating the violent extremists radicalizing islamist terrorists over the internet
does homeland security put more money into climate change than stopping online terrorism recruiting
however any complete analysis would show that federal departments and agencies spend significantly more money targeting terrorists than they do targeting climate change
