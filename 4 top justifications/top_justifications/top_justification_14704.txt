Says Pat Robertson said, "We must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes."
i personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear clothes for example
the uspoln website posted an article alleging that robertson called for a law to require gays and lesbians to wear specially colored clothes
fake news pat robertson did not say gays should wear clothes
to which robertson replies the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal straight people
allegedly drawing on an installment of robertson s show the club the post begins with robertson warning that legal rights of gays and lesbians will draw down god s wrath upon america
