Says the CBO said "it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan; it's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want."
it that people will choose not to buy something they do like or want
so it not that people are getting pushed off a plan
we went back to the cbo report to see if in fact it basically said that people will choose not to buy insurance
what they basically saying at the congressional budget office is if you not going to force people to buy obamacare if you re not going to force people to buy something they don t want then they wo buy it
ryan paraphrased the cbo as saying that millions more would not be insured basically because they would be free not to buy a policy they didn t want
