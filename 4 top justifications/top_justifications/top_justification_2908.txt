"America was the ONLY country that ended" slavery
america was the only country that ended slavery
a facebook post made many claims about slavery and specifically said that america was the only country that ended slavery
the claim that america was the only country that ended slavery is inaccurate
the united states was definitely not the only country that abolished slavery and was actually one of the last countries to abolish slavery in the americas
america was the only country that ended it black people owned slaves too
