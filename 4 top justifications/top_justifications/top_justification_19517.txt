The Baucus health care bill "could be used to ban guns in home self-defense."
in this item we scrutinize the claim that the baucus bill could be used to ban guns in home
the day before the finance committee began voting on amendments to the baucus bill goa sent an alert to members titled obamacare could be used to ban guns in home
ultimately we find that while the goa is right that a more behavioral approach to pricing health care seems to be gaining steam it is a giant and overly speculative leap to say that the baucus bill could be used to ban guns in home
this means that for most states gun owners or people with other behaviors that the government might theoretically deem unhealthy would actually get more explicit protection under the baucus bill than they have now
even if you assume that health care reform is rushing headlong into a new era in which behavior defines health premiums which is just speculation at this point there is nothing in the baucus bill that says or even suggests that gun ownership would be cited as a behavioral factor
