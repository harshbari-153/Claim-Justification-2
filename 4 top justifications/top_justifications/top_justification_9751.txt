"CNN says Dick Cheney will be advising Biden on foreign policy."
cnn says dick cheney will be advising biden on foreign policy another said
cnn just said dick cheney was advising joe biden read one facebook post
but we found nothing on cnn s website to suggest that biden has asked cheney to be a foreign policy adviser or any kind of adviser
no cnn didn t say dick cheney will be a foreign policy adviser for biden
but there s nothing to support the claims in these posts and cnn hasn t reported on cheney joining the biden team
