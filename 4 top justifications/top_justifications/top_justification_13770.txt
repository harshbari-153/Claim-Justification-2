The stimulus bill "didnâ€™t create one new job."
he said the stimulus bill didn t create one new job and when asked to clarify he said it hasn t created any new jobs
gov as being funded directly by the stimulus contradicts brown assertion that the bill didn t create one new job
the last stimulus bill didn t create one new job and in some states the money that was actually released hasn t even been used yet brown said
similarly borrowing money from one part of the economy and redistributing to another part of the economy will not create new growth no matter how big the stimulus bill
there are two ways to analyze this question looking at jobs created directly by the stimulus and looking at jobs created in the broader economy since the stimulus bill took effect
