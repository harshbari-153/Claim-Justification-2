Says the T.R.U.M.P. Act, which would force presidential candidates to release their tax returns to run in North Carolina, "has a lot of support â€“ by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties."
but we were intrigued by chaudhuri s final claim that this bill has a lot of support by a majority of north carolinians and members of both parties
ppp s january poll also found percent of north carolinians would favor a law requiring that a candidate for president release years of tax returns in order to appear on the ballot which is precisely the type of law chaudhuri proposed several months later
according to one polling firm chaudhuri is correct that most north carolinians want to see trump s tax returns and that the majority also would support a law requiring all presidential candidates to release their taxes
most north carolinians do want trump to release his taxes and would support a law that require all presidential hopefuls to do so according to public policy polling a firm based in raleigh that has polled the topic multiple times
the bill was clearly aimed at republican president donald trump but chaudhuri said it has a lot of support by a majority of north carolinians and members of both parties
