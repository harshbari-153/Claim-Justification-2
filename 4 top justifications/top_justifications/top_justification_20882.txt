Ted Buddâ€™s family used AgriBioTech money to help "give donations to these Washington special interest groups that are running negative ads against me in the Senate race."
and you know some of that same money now that was made is being used on tv ads against me because the budd family also helps give donations to these washington special interest groups that are running negative ads against me in the senate race
and that the special interest groups are using the budd family money to run negative ads against him
while mccrory washington special interest groups in his interview with kaliner his spokesman added that budd is also receiving donations from family members and people connected to agribiotech
budd s father and brother have donated money to club for growth action a group that s now running attack ads against the former governor
did the budd family make money off their loan to agribiotech that seems like a stretch
