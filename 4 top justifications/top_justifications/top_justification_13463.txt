Says Gov. Pat McCrory "tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years."
cooper said mccrory tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over years
we wondered if mccrory really did suggest cutting education funding to the lowest share of the overall state budget in more than years
pat mccrory talks about raising our pay but he tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over years she says
but the ad specifically said mccrory tried to cut education s budget share so it s fair to look at what mccrory proposed instead of what actually passed
so both cooper and mccrory oversaw budgets that gave a smaller slice of the pie to education
