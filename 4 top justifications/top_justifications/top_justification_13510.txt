"The refusal of many federal employees to fly coach costs taxpayers $146 million annually."
the example that most piqued our interest was this one the refusal of many federal employees to fly coach costs taxpayers million annually
we only had two quibbles the gao methodology does delve into the question of the employee motives when seeking a flight so we think refusal is too strong a word for newsmax to use when describring how the federal employees reacted to the idea of flying coach
gao noted that the million spent on flights accounted for less than percent of the cost of all federal government flights during the period
when we asked riedl about this he said that the point is that taxpayers paid for million in largely unnecessary spending
so the overcharges themselves amounted to less than percent of the total spent on federal airline travel
