"For decades before I was elected, governors tried and failed to get Minnesota out of the top 10 highest-taxed states in the country. I actually did it."
for decades before i was elected governors tried and failed to get minnesota out of the top states in the country pawlenty said
but when he says that for decades before i was elected governors tried and failed to get minnesota out of the top highest taxed states in the country he ignores that ventura achieved this in the three years before pawlenty became governor
according to the tax foundation data minnesota was out of the top for three of the four years ventura served as governor
had minnesota been in the top states for decades basically yes
was pawlenty the first governor to push the state out of the top no
