Says he was "a Marine during Vietnam."
senate for saying that he served in vietnam and during the vietnam era when in fact he actually received five military deferments before enlisting in the marine reserve enabling him to avoid combat overseas
dale peterson was in the marine corps during the vietnam war but there more to the story
i been a farmer a businessman a cop a marine during vietnam so listen up peterson barked
if i had served in vietnam i for damn sure would have said i did
you have to remember he said that he enlisted in the marine corps at a time when the military was not very popular in the united states
