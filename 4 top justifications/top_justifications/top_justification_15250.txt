The Employment Non-Discrimination Act "discriminates against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom."
the traditional values coalition said enda discriminates against christian daycare christian parents christian business owners and the rights of religious freedom
it because pryor has voted for the employment act enda in washington a bill that discriminates against christian daycare christian parents christian business owners and the rights of religious freedom
the bill s religious exemption indicates that churches initiatives and other religious businesses need not comply by employing people of all sexualities and gender identities
but christian nonprofits and christian or any other businesses with fewer than employees would be exempt
daycare if it were a secular daycare that just happened to be owned by a religious individual with a conviction that prohibited them from hiring lgbt folk then the exemption would not apply tebbe said
