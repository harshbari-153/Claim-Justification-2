"When (Marcy) Kaptur fought for the Democrats' prescription drug benefit for seniors, (Dennis) Kucinich voted no."
that brings us back to the claim in the ad when kaptur fought for the democrats prescription drug benefit for seniors kucinich voted no
now we look at a third statement when kaptur fought for the democrats prescription drug benefit for seniors kucinich voted no
it is misleading to imply that kucinich s no vote was a vote against a prescription benefit
according to the kaptur campaign kucinich voted against the prescription drug plan offered by conservative democrats in their alternative budget proposal the stenholm amendment at a time when there was no alternative with a chance
kucinich did in fact vote no when kaptur voted yes on one budget proposal
