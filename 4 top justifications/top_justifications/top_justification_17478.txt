"In America today, women on average are paid 80 cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work."
harris said in america today women on average are paid cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work
harris the law says that men and women should be paid equally for equal work but what we know is that in america today women on average are paid cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work
however there s a bigger problem with what harris said that women are paid cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work
instead it refers to average pay for all jobs held by men and all jobs held by women
the percent figure compares pay for all working women to pay for all working men so it s wrong for harris to characterize it as a comparison between women and men doing the same work
