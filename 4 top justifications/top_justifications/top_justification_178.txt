"Out of 860 bills (Sen. Bill Nelson has) introduced in Congress, only 10 have passed."
the republican party of florida said out of bills nelson has introduced in congress only have passed
while the republicans said nelson only had bills that passed that number refers to bills and resolutions enacted into law
out of bills he s introduced in congress only have passed said the website no more nelson sponsored by the republican party of florida
the republicans should have been more precise in the second half of the claim too the party said only bills from nelson have passed
nelson s office also showed politifact about a dozen examples of bills nelson sponsored in the senate but a similar version often in the house was signed into law
