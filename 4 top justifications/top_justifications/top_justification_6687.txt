Obama said troops "whine about bearing the costs" of going to war.
the chain that purports to be obama comments on troops is maliciously false
it also contrasts sharply with obama actual attitude toward the troops
look it an all volunteer force obama complained
it purports to be obama comments about veterans who opposed a proposal to change their health insurance
now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice it does compute
