Says "Every time the Legislature 'suspended' the kicker, most recently the corporate kicker in 2007, Salem spent every penny and failed to stabilize the state's revenues."
repealing the kicker may impress some wall street bankers but it do little to stabilize state finances and absolutely nothing to improve our economy and put people back to work wand wrote adding every time the legislature suspended the kicker most recently the corporate kicker in salem spent every penny and failed to stabilize the state revenues
did he blame the state s instability on the kicker did he think we should never use the kicker did he really think the kicker was supposed to stabilize the budget it turns out he was responding specifically to claims that democrats have made that if we suspend oregon s kicker magically the state budget will be stable and everything will be fine
it s true that the state has suspended the kicker three times although it s not true that the state has spent every penny in those instances
using the kicker did not stabilize the state s budget but that s largely due to an unreliable revenue base as well as extenuating circumstances loss of revenue from a ballot measure and a recession
in legislators took the corporate kicker and they used most of it in the following years even while increasing taxes and fees for other state needs
