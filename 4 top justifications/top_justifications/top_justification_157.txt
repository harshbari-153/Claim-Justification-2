"The McCarran-Walter Act of 1952 bans Muslims from holding public office in the United States."
the act of bans muslims from holding public office in the united states reads a facebook post from jan
act of never banned muslims from public office
and as other found last year the claim that it bars muslims from holding office is incorrect
still the law does not mention religion nor muslims
president harry truman worried that the law was discriminatory but congress had enough votes to override his veto
