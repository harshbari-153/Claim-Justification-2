"Wall Street comes out en masse with its money against House Democrats every election."
pelosi said wall street comes out en masse with its money against house democrats every election
when you said wall street i like no wall street comes out en masse with its money against house democrats every election pelosi said
when the democrats were in control including two cycles in which pelosi herself was speaker wall street has sent the majority of its money to house democrats
burdett loomis a university of kansas political scientist said it does seem like wall street has tended to support whatever party is in charge in the house
that wall street tends to support democrats these days a belief that irritated the reagan democrats who work alongside him at a steel mill in the industrial midwest
