"There are mechanisms in place to shut down the Internet privately."
napolitano claimed that there are mechanisms in place to shut down the internet privately
there are mechanisms in place to shut down the internet privately said napolitano
it is clear however that the government would have to participate in order to shut down its own networks and there is an argument to be made that shutting down the internet might hurt the response to a cyber attack more than it would help
we wondered whether napolitano is right that private internet providers have it all under control
we should note that shutting down the internet is just one of the many ways to respond to a cyber attack and probably not the best one at that
