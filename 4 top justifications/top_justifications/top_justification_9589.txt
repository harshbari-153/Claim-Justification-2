"We have ten different tax brackets and if you’re making $9,000, you’re already in the top tax bracket."
greitens said we have different tax brackets and if you re making you re already in the top tax bracket
when we refer back to the department s tax bracket chart we can see such an individual would fit into the state s fourth tax bracket instead of the highest tax bracket
in a thursday gop primary debate in columbia greitens offered figures to back his claim we have different tax brackets and if you re making you re already in the top tax bracket
a person making would fall in the fourth tax bracket closer to the bottom and certainly not at the top
the chart actually shows different tax brackets but that aside at first glance it seems to back up greitens claim
