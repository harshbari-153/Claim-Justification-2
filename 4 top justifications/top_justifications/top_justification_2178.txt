Says HJM 20 "was the only bill not assigned to a House committee."
in fact it was the only emphasis theirs bill not assigned to a house committee
so leaving aside the motives of kotek a democrat we wondered if this really was the only bill not assigned to a house committee
in an online post oregon catalyst lambasted kotek for not advancing hjm saying it was the only bill not assigned to a committee
was a bill condemning the scandal the only one not referred to a committee
but hjm which we ll note is a symbolic piece of legislation didn t go anywhere
