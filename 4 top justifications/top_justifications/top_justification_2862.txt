but did obama backtrack his anywhere anytime challenge was issued specifically to debate about our respective policies in iraq iran the middle east or around the world
on the same day obama told abc oh we definitely going to be doing some town hall debates
the genesis of obama anywhere anytime comment dates back to a may speech in watertown s
but then the obama campaign countered with a proposal for five joint appearances the three traditional debates after the conventions plus a joint town hall on the economy in july and a debate on foreign policy in august
