"Walker says heâ€™s for lower taxes. But Milwaukee County spending has gone up by $349 million."
in making his claim barrett is relying on the milwaukee county budgets since walker took office in
his focus on taxes has been a hallmark of his eight years as milwaukee county executive he s slashed county jobs cut spending on parks and programs and has returned a portion of his paychecks to the county coffers
to be sure walker does take the higher property tax levy and uses it as his starting point for the next year s budget
that settles the tax side but the overall argument made by barrett and other democrats remains scott walker is a closet tax and spender
republican gubernatorial candidate scott walker makes much of his efforts to hold down taxes and spending
