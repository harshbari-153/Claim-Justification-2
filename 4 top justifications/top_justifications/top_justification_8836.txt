Nick Freitas "supports a plan letting insurance companies deny coverage for preexisting conditions like asthma or diabetes."
in a tv ad the democratic congressional campaign committee says freitas supports a plan letting insurance companies deny coverage for preexisting conditions like asthma or diabetes
what caught our attention was the second part of the sentence that freitas supports a plan letting insurance companies deny coverage for preexisting conditions like asthma or diabetes
freitas raked in thousands from the insurance industry and supports a plan letting insurance companies deny coverage for preexisting conditions like asthma or diabetes the announcer says
but he said freitas is dedicated to protecting coverage for preexisting conditions and contrary to his statement wants a replacement plan before the law is repealed
freitas has repeatedly called for the abolishing obamacare which mandates that health insurance policies cover preexisting conditions
