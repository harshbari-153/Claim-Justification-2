The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine "is not approved."
text with another video states the pfizer vaccine is not an approved fda vaccine it only approved for emergency use for a third dose
the claim that the pfizer vaccine is not approved is wrong
one video started with a woman stating you guys the pfizer vaccine is not approved
but there is no question that the pfizer vaccine has received fda s approval
yes pfizer s vaccine is fda approved
