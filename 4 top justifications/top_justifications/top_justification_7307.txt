"In 1999, the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for (expanded background checks.)"
and i said all we have done and i said guess what in the nra leadership in washington pretty much the same people intact were for this
manchin explained his continued pursuit of expanding background checks saying that in even the nra leadership in washington pretty much the same people intact were for this
we ve checked related claims from new york mayor michael bloomberg and president barack obama that wayne lapierre executive vice president of the nra once supported wider background checks
he s correct that lapierre at the center of the most recent gun legislation battle testified before lawmakers that the nra supported mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale
the nra ultimately backed legislation in the house that did expand background checks to sales at gun shows but cut the time allowed for background checks to hours a change that ultimately killed the legislation
