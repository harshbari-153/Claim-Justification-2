"The (border) fence is now basically complete."
obama says the border fence is basically complete
in his speech in el paso on immigration reform on may president obama declared that the fence along the border with mexico is now basically complete
so what gives is the border fence now basically complete or not not to go all clinton on you but it largely depends on how you define fence
but is it accurate for obama to claim that the fence is now basically complete dhs reports that there is now fencing for of the miles described in the secure fence act of
it authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with mexico
