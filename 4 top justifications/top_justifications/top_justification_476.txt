The 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches "are going up."
carter said that the decisions the supreme court reaches are going up
one of the reasons i think we fight so hard is you look at the number of decisions the supreme court reaches
the most recent supreme court term had a higher rate of decisions than the previous two terms
however there s no discernible upward trend according to a scotusblog analysis of past terms as well as interviews with supreme court watchers
there may be a public perception that decisions are up perhaps owing to blockbuster rulings in recent years on everything from health care to voting rights to political spending that were decided by this slimmest of margins
