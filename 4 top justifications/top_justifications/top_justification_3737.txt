Says that "In 2009, I saved ratepayers around $500 million by persuading the Council to pursue a less expensive compliance mechanism if the City is required to treat Bull Run drinking water."
in i saved ratepayers around million by persuading the council to pursue a less expensive compliance mechanism if the city is required to treat bull run drinking water fritz writes on her campaign literature
did amanda fritz persuade the portland city council to save water ratepayers million
does that mean the state would save water ratepayers million to million depending on how you calculate cost there s a thought
i partnered with neighborhood and business advocates to get this done by arranging for a council work session and public hearing where citizens made clear that the less expensive option is more responsible
was it true that fritz had with citizen support and a public hearing persuaded the city council to go against a recommendation by the water bureau and did she in fact save ratepayers million portland gets its drinking water pretty much untouched from the bull run watershed east of the city
