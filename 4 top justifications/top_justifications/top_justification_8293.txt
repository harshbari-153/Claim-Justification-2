"I am very proud that I am the only candidate in the Democratic primary to have voted against all of Trump's defense budgets."
i am very proud that i am the only candidate in the democratic primary to have voted against all of trump defense budgets sanders says in the campaign video
so how can he claim to have voted against it and is he actually the only presidential candidate in the democratic field who has voted against all of the president s defense budgets
in a campaign video that has been viewed almost times on twitter alone sanders made the statement that he has voted against all of trump s defense budgets and that he is the only candidate in the democratic primary to do so
sanders also claims he is the only candidate in the democratic primary who has voted against all of the president s defense budgets
however there is one other candidate in the crowded democratic field who has cast votes in opposition of all three of the president s defense authorization bills
