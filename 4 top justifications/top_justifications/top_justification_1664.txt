"I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not (Hillary Clinton's)Â position."
sanders said i believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change
there s no doubt that sanders rhetoric on climate change and his plan to deal with it are aggressive and unlike clinton he has advocated for a carbon tax
unlike sanders clinton doesn t advocate for a carbon tax
i believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change
clinton does however have a climate change plan
