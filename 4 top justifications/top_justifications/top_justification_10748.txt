"They were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements."
now if you would believe it you know they were going to build the wall a while ago not so long ago like in
we were curious about wall plans from a decade ago and whether environmental impact statements hindered its construction as trump s statements suggest
trump said they were going to build the wall a while ago not so long ago like in
trump s statement suggests a wall or barrier was not built due to inability to get environmental impact statements
now we got lucky because it was such a little wall it was such a nothing wall no they could get their environmental probably a snake was in the way or a toad
