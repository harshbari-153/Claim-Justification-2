The GOP health care plan "would allow health insurance companies to continue engaging in unfair and discriminatory practices like denying coverage to people because of a pre-existing medical condition."
in a press release from the democratic national committee vice chair wasserman schultz said the gop plan would allow health insurance companies to continue engaging in unfair and discriminatory practices like denying coverage to people because of a medical condition
wasserman schultz was correct when she said the gop plan does not prohibit health insurance companies from denying coverage to people with conditions
wasserman schultz says gop alternative health care plan allows insurers to continue denying coverage for conditions
now that we seen the full gop alternative plan it shows wasserman schultz is correct that it does not prohibit health insurance companies from denying coverage to people due to medical conditions
they accept patients who have health conditions that might prompt private insurance companies to reject them
