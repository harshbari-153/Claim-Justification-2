"When the salmonella source was finally identified, FDA officials had to wait for industry approval before they could go live with the [peanut] recall."
when the salmonella source was finally identified fda officials had to wait for industry approval before they could go live with the recall the congresswoman said at a feb
and it true that the fda could not post on its web site this press release announcing the recall which came from the peanut corporation of america until the company agreed to issue the recall and wrote the release
and it was imprecise for her to say the fda waited for the company approval to go live with the recall the fda did not go live with the recall at all it was the company that issued it
we realized the recent outbreak of salmonella poisoning from peanut products exposed serious problems with food manufacturing and plant inspections
this is poorly understood by consumers the media and even some food companies the fda says in this primer on its recall policies
