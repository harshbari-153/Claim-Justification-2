"The Green Bay Packers are a socialist organization."
think tank writer says green bay packers socialist organization
well did keyes complete his hail mary pass the reporter for a website said the green bay packers are a socialist organization
he closed with a bolder statement declaring last year s super bowl champions the green bay packers are a socialist organization
but the fact that the packers are different than any other nfl team doesn t make it a socialist organization
he said his main point was that the packers while not a perfectly or purely socialist organization were far more socialistic than all of the other nfl teams primarily because they are owned by people not controlled by a single owner
