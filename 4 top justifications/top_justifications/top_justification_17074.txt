Scott Wallace wants to tax families of five for 'irresponsible breeding'
the ad claims wallace wants to tax families of five for irresponsible breeding
no congressional candidate scott wallace does not want to tax families for
but wallace has never personally called for the taxation of people with more than two children or accused them of irresponsible breeding
does wallace who has three children actually advocate for a tax we decided to the claim
the nrcc released a similar web ad that states wallace thinks families with more than two children should be taxed to the hilt
