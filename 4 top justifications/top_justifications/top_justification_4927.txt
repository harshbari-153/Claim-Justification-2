Says "Having organizations parading as being social welfare organizations and then being involved in the political combat harkens back to why the statute a hundred years ago said that they were prohibited."
but i think having organizations parading as being social welfare organizations and then being involved in the political combat harkens back to why the statute a hundred years ago said that they were prohibited and why i wholeheartedly agree with my colleague mr
blumenauer said that the act placed a prohibition on political organizations by not including such activity as being eligible for exemption as social welfare
blumenauer said that the statute a hundred years ago said that they were prohibited
he said two things signal to him that political groups are prohibited
our question was a simple one was there a tax statute years ago that specifically prohibited political groups from claiming tax exempt status under a social welfare provision
