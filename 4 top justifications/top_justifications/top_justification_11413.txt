"The minions from ‘Despicable Me’ are based off of these Jewish children tortured by Nazis during the Holocaust."
the minions from despicable me are based off of these jewish children tortured by nazis during the holocaust the post says
and among the movies that minions a despicable me prequel draws inspiration from is a film that satirically alludes to adolf hitler
no weren t inspired by jewish children who endured the holocaust
their high pitched voices in the movie are meant to represent the high pitched screams of the children during the cruel experiments
rather we found multiple debunking this claim which isn t new and has circulated in several languages as well as evidence that the photo was taken of submarine crew members decades before the holocaust started
