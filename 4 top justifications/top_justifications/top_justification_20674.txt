"Our president has labeled Americans as soft."
our president has labeled americans as soft
we wondered if obama had really labeled americans as soft
saying the country had gotten soft in the past as obama did is less immediate personal and provocative than saying americans are currently soft
two days after the obama interview perry told fox news that it not americans who are soft but the president
for example a news article on the cbs news website described obama as saying the united states had gotten a little soft before he took office
