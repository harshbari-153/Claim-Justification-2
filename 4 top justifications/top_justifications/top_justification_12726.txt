Figures cited by Gov. Scott Walker "are not commonly used" to measure job creation.
democrat tom barrett says republican gov scott walker is citing jobs numbers that are not commonly used
barrett is right that preliminary census figures are are not typically cited
we rated walker s claim the state added jobs on his watch mostly false in part because he combined the unverified annual census data for with less reliable monthly survey data for and we rated false barrett s claim walker cooked the books by releasing numbers he just dreamed up
in a new separate item we rated half true that walker claim from the debate
much of the confusion stems from the unusual decision by the walker administration to release a batch of jobs data almost six weeks before it is to be released by the federal bureau of labor statistics
