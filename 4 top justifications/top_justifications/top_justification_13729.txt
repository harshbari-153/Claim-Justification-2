"We proudly handed the Biden administration the most secure border in history. All they had to do was keep this smooth-running system on autopilot."
we proudly handed the biden administration the most secure border in history trump said in a march statement
trump said we proudly handed the biden administration the most secure border in history
trump s claim that the border was the most secure and on autopilot is a significant exaggeration
i do see how biden could have maintained trump policies given the outcome of the election and the shifting situation on the border
trump said biden could have operated on autopilot but experts said each administration must examine legal rulings and current conditions
