Says that Ronald Reagan said he felt like he "was the one shaking hands with the president" when he met Donald Trump.
no ronald reagan did say meeting trump felt like shaking hands with the president
for the life of me and i ll never know how to explain it when i met that young man i felt like i was the one shaking hands with the president the post claims reagan said about meeting trump
did president ronald reagan sense he had met a successor to the presidency after shaking hands with a young donald trump no but a photo of the two men that appeared on facebook on feb
the image shows reagan shaking trump hand in the blue room at a reception for members of an art and preservation in embassies foundation
though there are several photos of the former president and trump together the meetings didn t inspire reagan to wax poetic about the current commander in chief
