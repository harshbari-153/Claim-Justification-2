State House incumbent Jill Chambers, R-Atlanta, "personally profits from taxpayer money."
even worse jill chambers personally profits from taxpayer money the mailer said
if that was enough chambers has charged taxpayers an additional for her on top of her salary
the democrats claim on her behalf that chambers profits off of taxpayer money cites information from the general assembly legislative fiscal office which keeps track of member expenses
elaborates this year alone chambers billed taxpayers for her expenses on days when the legislature was even in session
given this information the accusation that chambers profits from taxpayer money is out of bounds
