billion in cuts to charity care funding for hospitals
claiming that the build back better act would slash charity funds without accounting for increased spending that would expand coverage and so decrease the need for such charity funds is misleading said david gamage professor of health policy law at the university of indiana
billion in the build back better act to give private health insurance to the people who would have been covered under medicaid expansion money that would presumably reduce the need for federal spending on charity care
the bill would reduce the money that compensates hospitals for charity care
the build back better act aims to do so by steering more money to private insurance subsidies
