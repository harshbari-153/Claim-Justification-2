well the majority last quarter of sherrod brown campaign contributions came from outside of the state of ohio he said
yet data that includes brown s current term but also goes back to his days in the house of representatives crunched on a regular basis by the center for responsive politics for every member of congress shows that a majority of brown s donations have always been from ohio
brown got the majority of his contributions from ohioans in state compared with out of state
his spokesman joe aquilino shot us an while we were still sorting the data saying josh misspoke and meant to say that the majority this year of sherrod brown campaign contributions have come from outside the state of ohio
