claim that mitch mcconnell donor is sanctioned russian oligarch
a post says mcconnell s biggest donor is a russian oligarch who was released from u

of receiving donations from a russian oligarch who the congress recently lifted sanctions on
moscow is none other than the russian oligarch that the gop just lifted sanctions on
