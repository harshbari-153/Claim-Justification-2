"Harvard Study Finds States With Most Gun Laws Have Fewest Gun Deaths."
in the end when the facebook posting says harvard study finds states with most gun laws have fewest gun deaths it is correctly summarizing one finding of the study
the posting has the joe friday character from tv dragnet saying just the facts followed by this headline harvard study finds states with most gun laws have fewest gun deaths
but it leaves out important details and context that argue against the idea that reducing gun deaths is simply a matter of blindly passing more gun laws in each state
