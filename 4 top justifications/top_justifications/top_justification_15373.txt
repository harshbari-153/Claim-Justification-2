"Most of Ted Cruzâ€™s money comes from Washington, from outside the state of Texas."
most of ted cruz s money comes from washington from outside the state of texas and they ve run millions and millions of untrue ads against me
david dewhurst says most of ted cruz money comes from washington from outside the state of texas
questionable advertising aside we wondered if cruz a lawyer and former state solicitor general had indeed raised most of his money from washington and out of state
a june analysis by the texas tribune notes that it s not known where more than million of cruz s contributions came from
so cruz has raised less than percent of his money from washington givers less than percent from donors outside texas though this does not account for the origins of his unitemized donations
