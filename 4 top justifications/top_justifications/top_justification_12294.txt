Under H.R. 1, the Federal Election Commission "for the first time ever, instead of being an equal number of Republicans and Democrats (would be) three of one side and two of the other."
under the bill blunt said there a partisan federal election commission where for the first time ever instead of being an equal number of republicans and democrats it three of one side and two of the other
the fec for the first time ever instead of being an equal number of republicans and democrats would be three of one side and two of the other
if a fifth member did make it through the vetting process but later showed partisan leanings the newly commission could for the first time in its history enforce policy without bipartisan support
if congress wanted to destroy confidence in the fairness of american elections it is hard to imagine a better first step than to eviscerate the fec s bipartisan structure
there would likely be two democratic commissioners two republican commissioners and one commissioner preventing any side from holding the majority or the agency from becoming partisan
