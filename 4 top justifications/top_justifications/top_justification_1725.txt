"In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents."
trump said in the house republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents
later in the press conference trump said in the house republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents and overcame a historic number of retirements
but trump is wrong that the republicans outperformed historical precedents
and while the republican outlook in the house was indeed harmed by retirements as trump said the gop conversely benefited from district lines that were drawn largely by republicans following the census
and last night the republican party defied history to expand our senate majority while significantly beating expectations in the house
