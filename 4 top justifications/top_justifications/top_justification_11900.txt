McCain's energy plan is a "single-answer proposition" â€” new domestic oil drilling.
some may argue that mccain plan does do enough to develop alternative fuels or that his plan for new domestic oil drilling perpetuates the country dependence on oil but that does mean mccain energy plan is a proposition built around new oil drilling
mccain stressed that more domestic oil drilling is only part of his energy plan
john mccain energy plan as reliant on more domestic oil drilling
mccain energy plan not just more drilling
in fact mccain energy plan includes many provisions that have nothing to do with drilling
