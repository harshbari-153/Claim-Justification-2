Says Gov. Tony Evers "tried to make us pay even more at the pump by hiking the gas tax."
among the claims in the ad evers tried to make us pay even more at the pump by hiking the gas tax
a wmc issues mobilization council ad claimed evers tried to make us pay even more at the pump by hiking the gas tax
ad claiming evers tried to make us pay even more at the pump is running on half tank
so evers definitely pushed a gas tax increase
in any case all of that goes against the idea that the primary aim of evers plan was to simply raise the gas tax
