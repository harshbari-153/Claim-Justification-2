George Allen cast "the deciding vote" for the 2003 Bush tax cuts.
tim kaine says george allen cast the deciding vote for bush tax cuts
our conclusion kaine said allen cast the deciding vote in passing the package of bush tax cuts
did allen cast the pivotal vote on whether those tax cuts went into effect we decided to check
it is similarly misleading for kaine to claim allen cast the deciding vote on the tax cuts when cheney broke the tie at the end
it s true that allen s support helped lead to a split setting up a vote for the tax cuts by vice president cheney
