Says Rep. Rashida Tlaib "wears the symbolic scarf patterned after the Islamic terrorist state."
congresswoman wears the symbolic scarf patterned after the islamic terrorist state reads the post next to two images of people wearing the keffiyeh
post falsely ties tlaib scarf to islamic state
this post plays off of a similar claim circulated in december that accused tlaib of wearing the scarf of hamas terrorists
one picture shows tlaib on the house floor with the scarf around her neck and the other of an armed militant with the scarf over his face
the scarf in the post is associated with palestinians not the islamic state
