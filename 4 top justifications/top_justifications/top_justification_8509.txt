Says Clinton did not read the National Intelligence Estimate before voting for the Iraq war.
as a presidential candidate clinton has repeatedly said she made a mistake voting for the resolution but also noted that reading the entire national intelligence estimate was not a necessity because she and other lawmakers were getting frequent briefings from bush administration officials
clinton was far from the only member of congress to rely on briefings instead of actually reading the document
first suggested she did not read the report
graham in a piece in the washington post said a careful reading of the national intelligence estimate revealed it did contain the rationale for a war in iraq
if you have a national intelligence estimate and the chairman of the senate intelligence committee says should read this this is why i voting against the war you should read it obama said in a speech in westerville ohio on march
