The U.S. gives foreign aid to Cuba and Venezuela, even though those countries are our enemies.
aid to venezuela and cuba is incorrect
sends aid to the cuban regime
why do we give money to cuba americans can t even go to cuba
meanwhile the aid sent to cuba is certainly not going into the government s coffers and it like the venezuela aid is considered far likelier to undercut the government than support it
aid goes to the cuban government
