"Boyce gave (a lobbyist’s) wife a sensitive job in the treasurer’s office, a job Boyce admitted he only made available at their mosque."
boyce gave a lobbyist s wife a sensitive job in the treasurer s office a job boyce admitted he only made available at their mosque the commercial s narrator says
there is no denying boyce hired the lobbyist s wife but mandel stretched the truth when he tied boyce to the job announcement at a mosque
despite these inconsistencies from boyce s office it is clear boyce himself never announced the executive assistant s job at a mosque
we asked mandel s campaign to explain why the commercial claimed it was boyce not ahmad who made the job announcement at their mosque a phrase that implies boyce belongs to the mosque
but mandel s commercial doesn t say ahmad announced the job a mosque it says boyce himself made the job available there
