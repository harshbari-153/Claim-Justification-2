"Under my predecessor, they cut funding for education, but they didn't give them anything in return to make up for that," leading to "less money" for school districts
you see under my predecessor they cut funding for education but they did give them anything in return to make up for that
we wondered about walker s claim that under doyle democrats cut school funding but didn t give districts anything in return to make up for that resulting in less money for local districts such as mps
walker contended that under his democratic predecessor school funding was cut but the state didn t give school districts anything in return to make up for that
so let s look at both the cost and revenue side of the equation as we judge walker s claim that doyle cut school funding and did it in a way that didn t give local school districts any way to make up for the lost aid
walker says doyle cut education funding without giving districts a way to make it up
