People with the COVID-19 vaccine are being "tracked in real time via 5G cellular, and all that data can be hacked into to track you."
claim vaccinated people are being tracked in real time via cellular and all that data can be to track you the post s headline reads
a video shared by a radio host resurfaces a previously debunked claim that vaccines contain a microchip allowing a person to be tracked through the cellular network
no a video doesn t prove the vaccines allow people to be tracked through a network
there may be trackers on the vaccine shipment boxes to protect them from theft but there are no trackers in the vaccines themselves the agency says
there is no evidence that any of the vaccines currently in use contain microchips or any ingredients with networking capabilities that allow people to be tracked
