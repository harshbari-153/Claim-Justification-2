Says that, unlike the U.S. Senate, "even the Libyan government, in the middle of a civil war, passed a budget on June 15, 2011"
later she added that even the libyan government in the middle of a civil war passed a budget on june
senate hasn t passed a budget in more than two years and libya passed one as recently as june of this year
so buerkle was right that libya s government passed a budget on that date
in addition the libyan budget would have had to go through some formal steps of governance
and the passage of the budget in june is seen as demonstrating less about libya s normal functioning of government and more about the gadhafi regime s need to show the world that it s withstanding the offensives of the rebels
