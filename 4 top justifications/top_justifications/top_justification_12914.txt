"We didnâ€™t have a development director for over seven months."
in a speech this month at a candidate s forum kasich told a group economic analysts and community planners we didn t have a development director for over seven months
in this case kasich might argue that he is technically correct because the development department had no permanent director for seven months although there were interim people in charge the entire time
that means ohio was without a permanent development director from february to september of last year
we think a natural impression someone would get from kasich s statement is that he was saying the chair was empty that ohio s agency was without leadership for seven months just as the recession was gobbling up jobs in the buckeye state at a quickening pace
that duty typically falls to the director of the ohio department of development
