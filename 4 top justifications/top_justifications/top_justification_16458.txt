"President Obama will now own 60 percent of GM, and his union buddies will own almost 20 percent."
president obama will now own percent of gm and his union buddies will own almost percent
steele goes on to say that obama union buddies will own almost percent
so steele is right that the administration will have a percent ownership in the new general motors and that the union will have nearly percent
and what do the taxpayers get they ll get stuck with up to a billion tab for the taxpayer dollars obama is using to pay for his takeover of gm
whether this is a boon to obama union buddies as steele statement says is a matter of opinion
