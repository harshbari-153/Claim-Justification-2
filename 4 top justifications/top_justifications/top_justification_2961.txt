this industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that europe is able to claim
they agreed that robinson second point that the industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that europe is able to claim has some truth to it
our experts tell us that it widely understood that the fall of the soviet union meant major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in europe
the point i was trying to make and i still believe it valid is that the soviet bloc collapse created a huge in emissions that makes the numbers look better than they otherwise would against the kyoto targets he wrote
but more importantly europe has had some pretty serious policies in place to reduce emissions levi said including a carbon trading plan and incentives for alternative energy production
