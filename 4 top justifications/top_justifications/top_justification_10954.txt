"Kavanaugh accuser’s brother’s firm linked to Fusion GPS."
no christine blasey ford brother is linked to fusion gps russia investigation
in fusion gps subcontracted with christopher steele a british intelligence officer to produce the russian dossier
this theory that somehow ford is linked to the russia investigation through her brother s old job comes from the fact that in nine years after blasey left bakerhostetler the firm hired fusion gps a consulting firm to assist with a russian investigation
i categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation kavanaugh said in a statement
christine blasey ford s brother s job history from years ago has been pulled into widespread internet speculation about ford s accusations against supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh
