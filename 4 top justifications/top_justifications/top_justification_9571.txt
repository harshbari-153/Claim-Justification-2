"In 2016, when Hillary Clinton appeared to have a firm lead in the polls â€” oh, just before the election, it was President Obama who laughed off any notion that American elections could possibly be tampered with."
and despite this in when hillary clinton appeared to have a firm lead in the polls oh just before the election it was president obama who laughed off any notion that american elections could possibly be tampered with
hannity said in when hillary clinton appeared to have a firm lead in the polls oh just before the election it was president obama who laughed off any notion that american elections could possibly be tampered with
so obama did show concern and he was responding to trump s early claims of a rigged election based on voter fraud when he made the comment hannity singled out
what hannity did not mention however was that obama s remarks actually came in response to a reporter s question about voter fraud and trump s claims that the election could be rigged
i have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place
