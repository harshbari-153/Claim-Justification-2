Kathryn Starkey "aided and abetted the continued taxation on residentsâ€™ properties over 70 percent of the time by seconding motions and voting to keep the millage rate the same."
after questioning starkey s attendance record as a member of the river basin board the mailer says that when she did attend starkey aided and abetted the continued taxation on residents properties over percent of the time by seconding motions and voting to keep the millage rate the same despite skyrocketing property values that allowed local governments to pad their budgets
pennington s mailer is technically correct starkey did go along with votes most of the time to keep the tax rate for the basin board the same even as taxable values soared
so overall she voted over percent of the time to keep the same tax rate
and it was starkey who took the lead role in when she again argued for lowering the rate this time making a motion to set it at cents
but it leaves out the important context that starkey tried over three years to lower the tax rate
