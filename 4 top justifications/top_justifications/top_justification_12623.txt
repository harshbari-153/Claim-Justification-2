posobiec tweeted that trump decided to not work with cambridge analytica during the election

so while cambridge analytica played a lesser role in its direct work for the trump campaign it actively aided trump s candidacy in other ways
how many outlets are reporting the fact that parscale and trump decided to not work with cambridge analytica during the election
trump campaign used cambridge analytica in final months of campaign
