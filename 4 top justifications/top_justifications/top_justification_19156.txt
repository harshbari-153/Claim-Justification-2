"I'm the only governor in America ... who signed a law that says there needs to be an independent investigation any time there's a death of someone in police custody."
i m proud to say i the only governor in america the first one and i believe the only one today who signed a law that says there needs to be an independent investigation any time there a death of someone in police custody
scott walker i the only governor to sign law requiring investigations of deaths in police custody
walker said he was the only governor to sign a bill that required an independent investigation into killings
it required that whenever an officer on or kills someone there will be an investigation by at least two investigators neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the death
we wanted to see if walker in fact is the only governor to have approved a statewide law
