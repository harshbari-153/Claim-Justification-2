"EPA wants to regulate â€¦ the family BBQ."
so we took a look at whether west was correct that the epa wants to regulate the family bbq
west said the epa wants to regulate the family bbq
the article was headlined two things the epa wants to regulate in your life and referred to alleged interest by the environmental protection agency in backyard barbecues and hotel shower water
but it s wrong to say as west does that their existence demonstrates that the epa wants to regulate backyard barbecues
why is the epa concerned about bbq grill emissions who are these people and why are they using one single dime of american taxpayer dollars for this tomfoolery
