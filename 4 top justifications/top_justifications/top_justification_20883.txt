"Private insurance gives â€¦ better coverage" than people would get under a Medicaid expansion.
born said in an interview that private insurance gives better coverage than people would get under a medicaid expansion
does private insurance really provide better coverage to the individual than medicaid
some specialties do have fewer options under medicaid than private insurance but generally speaking studies and experts say the care access is comparable between the two
expanding medicaid to people making of the federal poverty level gives insurance coverage to tens of thousands of people that are currently uninsured clearly better coverage
the point born asserted he was trying to make is that private insurance gives a person access to more doctors than medicaid
