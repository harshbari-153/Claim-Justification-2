Two photos show climate change "is a hoax."
a facebook post says two water photos apparently from the same location show climate change is a hoax
a few days before earth day a meme spread across facebook claiming to have proof that climate change is a hoax
no two photos don t reveal sea levels don t prove climate change is a hoax
the post is wrong and climate change is all too real
then they started calling it climate change
