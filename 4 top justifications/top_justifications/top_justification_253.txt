Says Marco Rubio sold a home to a chiropractor who had been lobbying him on automobile insurance legislation and "once he sold the home, for $380,000 cash, the speaker's position on the issue changed."
crist condensed the facts when he said that the chiropractor lobbying rubio bought the house
more than halfway through the debate crist implied without saying of course that rubio might have sold a vote on automobile insurance legislation to a chiropractor in whose mother bought his house
rubio would have been better off selling his house to someone other than the mother of a chiropractor who was trying to get him to extend personal injury protection
but rubio and some members of the florida house were sold
when rubio was speaker of the florida house he had a home here in miami in south florida
