anywhere from to miles per side will easily produce all the electricity in the united states with any solar technology said mason director of the american solar action plan and the renewable energy research institute in farmingdale n
mason and zweibel said that when they wrote that square miles would be needed to meet the electricity demand in they were assuming electricity would provide a much greater portion of the country energy than it does now including for example million hybrid vehicles
