a bit later maddow said fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate
maddow said that fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate
we turned to political scientists to help us assess whether that shift is the same as maddow s claim that fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria
in this we focus just on the question of whether fox changed the rules of the game for the polls it would use
