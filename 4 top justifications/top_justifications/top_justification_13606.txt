Since Rep. John Boccieri’s election, "Ohio has lost 600,000 jobs" and his district’s "unemployment has doubled."
this brings us to renacci s related point that since boccieri became a representative of the congressional district unemployment has doubled
bureau of labor statistics we found that from january when boccieri took office through august the most recent month counted when renacci made his claim ohio lost jobs
what we ve learned is that over the last couple of years ohio has lost over jobs
slepian responded that while renacci said the state has lost jobs over the last couple of years his number was actually in reference to ohio s unemployment rate not its job losses
boccieri has become a representative of the district unemployment has doubled
