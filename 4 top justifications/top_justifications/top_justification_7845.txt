Says Mike Dovilla supports a plan "that could allow a foreign corporation to take over the Ohio Turnpike" ¬ê
now dovilla has signed on to a dangerous plan that could allow a foreign corporation to take over the ohio turnpike said a mailer paid for by the ohio democratic party
the party said he supported unloading the turnpike to a private operator rather than keeping it in control of the ohio turnpike commission on whose board dovilla serves as a member
hard to ignore that dovilla did vote for the house version of the bill which if not later amended would have allowed the governor alone to strike a turnpike privatization deal
a separate ad from democrats states that because of dovilla you could pay a foreign corporation every time you drive the turnpike
so where does that leave us in this spat between dovilla and the democratic party the strength of the democratic argument is that dovilla s initial vote was for a bill that among hundreds if not thousands of other provisions gave the governor sole authority to lease the turnpike without legislative input or authorization
