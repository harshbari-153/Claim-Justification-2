Says it doesn't make sense for young adults to get the vaccine since they "really are not under that much of a threat as a result of this virus."
tiffany said it does make sense for young adults to get the vaccine since they really are not under that much of a threat as a result of this virus
so tiffany is claiming it does make sense for young adults to get the vaccine since they really are not under that much of a threat as a result of this virus
he s correct that younger people generally are less likely than their older counterparts to become severely ill or die from the virus but still it has happened meaning the vaccine would personally protect even young people from severe disease or death even if the risk is small
should young people skip the vaccine because the threat is lower
you really are not under that much of a threat as a result of this virus and i m not sure why you would go and take a vaccine as a result of that
