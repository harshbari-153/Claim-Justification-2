"The ABA's own criteria for a judicial nominee call for, among other things, at least 12 years' experience in the practice of law, and they mean actual practice of law."
the aba panel own criteria do indeed call for among other things at least years experience in the practice of law as kyl put it
ultimately then kyl is correct to say that the aba does call for years of practical law experience
given this lack of experience practicing law i was surprised that the american bar association awarded her a rating since the aba own criteria for a judicial nominee call for among other things at least years experience in the practice of law and they mean actual practice of law like former justices william rehnquist and lewis powell
kyl says american bar association calls for years of experience in practice of law
put these all together and her total time spent pursuing the pure practice of law as opposed to positions merely related to the law would come to somewhere between five or six years
