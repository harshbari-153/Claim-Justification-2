Says he can be on the ballot for Congress while serving time in jail.
can a convicted felon run for congress from jail
for a general election there are two ways to get on the ballot as the nominee of a party or by getting enough alabama voters to sign a petition
but getting his name on the ballot is a different matter
this leads to the potentially paradoxical situation that should he get on the ballot he wouldn t be able to vote for himself
by night he is an inmate at the baldwin county jail where he is serving a sentence for perjury
