"I didn't campaign on a public option."
but i did campaign on a public option
so during the campaign the public option was not mentioned much
we got an from a reader pointing out obama statement that he did not campaign on a public option
obama new claim is i did campaign on a public option
but we also have to say that the public option was not a very prominent part of obama platform
