GOP presidential hopeful Herman Cain called Ron Paulâ€™s followers "ignorant."
but paul was very specific that one of the strong terms cain used against his backers was the word ignorant
paul herman cain called federal reserve critics ignorant
you could even say that cain belittled paul s followers as the texan claimed during the debate
we found that cain isn t shy about his disdain for paul s criticisms
did cain really call paul and his followers ignorant the fed is a touchy issue among many republicans especially paul supporters who think it conducts too much business behind closed doors
