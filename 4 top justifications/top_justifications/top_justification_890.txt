Dave Brat "worked on Democrat Gov. Tim Kaineâ€™s Council of Economic Advisors while Kaine tried to raise our taxes by over $1 billion."
tim kaine s council of economic advisers while kaine tried to raise our taxes by over billion the announcer says
tim kaine s council of economic advisors while kaine tried to raise our taxes by over billion
the ad does not explicitly say these two events are connected but mentioning them in the same sentence creates an unfair impression that brat was part of a group that advised kaine to raise taxes
eric cantor says dave brat served as economic adviser to tim kaine
brat clearly served on the panel and kaine clearly sought tax hikes
