Says this crowd video shows the ongoing protests in Cuba.
like this video which was posted on twitter on july with the caption cuba right now
people in cuba have taken to the streets chanting for freedom and protesting food and medicine shortages price hikes and the country s worsening economic crisis in one of the largest demonstrations that the region has seen in years
this video doesn t show people protesting and it was not taken in cuba
viral video shows a soccer celebration in buenos aires not protests in cuba
but some online are spreading unrelated images of large crowds and claiming that they depict the ongoing unrest
