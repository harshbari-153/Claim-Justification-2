"People are being diagnosed with delta variant" even though "there is no delta variant test."
since there is no delta variant test exactly how are people being diagnosed with delta variant
no one is being diagnosed with the delta variant or any other variant
testing not individual testing tells when delta variant causes
routine tests that individuals receive to determine whether they have do not reveal whether the disease was caused by the delta variant
individuals are not being diagnosed with the delta variant
