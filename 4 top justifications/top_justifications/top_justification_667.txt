Says Mitt Romney's comments indicated he would not have pursued Osama bin Laden.
by using that quote the ad indicates that romney would not have pursued the leader
our ruling an obama campaign ad suggested mitt romney wouldn t have agressively pursued osama bin laden by citing romney statement that it not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person
by contrast it portrays romney as less committed to the effort to kill the leader
the ap interview there s no dispute that romney said about bin laden it not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person
still romney was clear later that summer that he would prefer to participate with allies rather than take unilateral action to kill terrorists as obama supported and later did
