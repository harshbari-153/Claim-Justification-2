White House spokesman Robert Gibbs "lied" when he said President Obama's birth certificate is posted on the Internet.
claim gibbs lied when he said obama birth certificate is posted on the internet
so back to the claim that gibbs lied about posting obama birth certificate on the internet
worldnetdaily may be right that the original birth certificate was posted but if hawaii says the the document obama posted can rightly be called obama birth certificate how is gibbs lying we harbor no delusions that anything we say here will slow the persistent drumbeat of the birthers but we rule this statement falseworldnetdaily is correct that the obama campaign did post his original birth certificate on the internet
the question here is did gibbs lie some background on june after months of hounding by the media and wild internet speculation that obama was actually born in either indonesia or kenya the obama campaign finally released a copy of obama certification of birth from hawaii and posted it on the internet
