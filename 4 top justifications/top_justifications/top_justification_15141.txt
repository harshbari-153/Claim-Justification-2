"I was the first presidential candidate to lay out a specific, truly universal health care plan."
at a debate john edwards talked about his support for universal health care capping it off by saying he was the first candidate to lay out a specific plan
yes kucinich is a candidate but he been promoting a fairly specific universal health care plan since at least and arguably earlier
and he did beat those two to the health care punch by several months introducing his plan in february while obama introduced his in may and clinton in september
after that the plan has an individual mandate requiring every person to be insured
it would provide free health care for all including primary care prescription drugs and mental health services
