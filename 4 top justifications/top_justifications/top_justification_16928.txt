Members of Congress can "retire with the same pay after only one term" in office
can members of congress retire with full pay after just one term
but the email contains another claim that several readers have asked about in recent days that members of congress can retire with the same pay after only one term
so the email saying that members of congress can receive full pay retirement after serving one term is blatantly bogus
a congressman or senator who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of for six years of work
the claim means that members of the house of representatives would receive full pay of per year for the rest of their lives after serving as little as two years
